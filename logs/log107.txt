You force your patient into Cardiac Arrest
And same with Colgate..
To prove your point to cuddy.
Then she calls you an asshole and gives you the permission for the MRI
Which comes up clean.
i shall find these pictures of the other magic pwnies.....
I think one of the talents all background ponies have is to be in multiple places at once
but first
Then you get a bone marrow biopsy and she has cancer.
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-aww-thanks-fluttershy.jpg
*SHE HATES YOU, DEAL WITH IT.*
Then you pump her full off chemo
MY GUESS: They both die, and are buried next to each other. Or they live, which is mundane.
And watch her die, in which you talk to Wilson and have a "House moment" in which you give her steroids against a bacterial infection
was that WoW on that screen just then? XD

Oh in which case I will have you know, in the end of season 7, House rams his car into Cuddy's house and through her living room.
Wow.
Who is Cuddy, again?
2,14 I'd be angry DuspenDe, if that hadn't already been spoiled to me by my roommate
Then he is happy and goes on vacation.
The boss.
Cuddy is the hot Dean of Medicine.
Oh yes. I see.
inb4 flatline.
You can't spoil it to me, but someone else might not like spoilers.
_________________________
>mfw DuspenDe just spoiled it to me. WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

I'm worried about everything you say DuspenDe. Because it makes me think each times you're an inch away from spoiling the episode's solution
Vandarium: took a lot of courage to buy them, but i didn't use any autocheck, and two dads gave me faces of disapproval. In Spain, those kinda faces are very, very scary. but yes Brushables are so awesome

He's faking.
Like I said I love this episode because House is so awesome in this
Daz, it didn't work. It opened a new picture
He wants to pretend god cures him.
House then does an MRI or CT scan
Finds out something is actually wrong.
Vandarium: right click, and from the new options 'open image in new tab,' NOT left click :P
Then is all self satisfied as he tells his faker he is not a faker afterall.
try it Vandarium
My sister had a classmate who tried to hold an exorcism on another classmate for being clumsy. :0
this is go be good
ah sorry yea, Vandarium i meant 'open IMAGE in new tab,' not 'open link in new tab'

Let me be the doctor here.
Give him a fucking MRI
Bob parr?

2,14 well, I quit soft drinks about 2 months ago
I bet you it will reveal tuberous Sclerosis.
Let me guess. Shes cured of her cancer?
/me is going to go play something I guess
Oh look
I was right.
Yes
Thank you.
I'm a horrible person, using Rarity as a replacement wheel for a car :/
13Umad?
Leave, Wilson. Let House do his job.

It's hardly a leap of logic there DuspenDe
Foreman and Cameron, go give him an MRI.
Just be careful so that your um salt levels do not drop too much
salty levels :3
2,14 but I want Dr. House to HEEEYULLLLL me

You all owe me 20 dollars.

Hiya
13Hey Denied
13I got that info you needed
13And a picture
hardly a 'God,' DuspenDe, but grats aniwahy
anyway *
settle down mah boi...
Oh good! Send it over
http://miburl.com/e27LGY
13This is Wreks pony
PICTURE SPAMS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It's not a cure, it's a diagnosis.
13Cutie mark is a lotus flower
still too early
13He said about Dr Whoof in size
It's Herpes.
Check his urine, you'll see I'm right.
2,14 not sure if trolling, or breaking spoilers...
Oh...well he DOES have a female persona...
erhem... fictional charecter
I may need to rethink the gender based equations....
I am not breaking spoilers.
13Erm
I am using deductive reasoning
To find out what is wrong.
13He said as a mail, she has the same tail
It is Herpes.
13But a shorter mane with a bit more fluff
it was just a picture of disappointed fluttershy
http://miburl.com/Yh0TNS
herpes makes tumors now?
Herpes Encephalitis.
i know just about nothing about medicine, so :P
13You dont think you could convert her to male?
http://miburl.com/jqmWcr
No.
Im serious. how dose herpes work?
13Decap
But the Herpes is fighting the tumors.
13Y u no find bigger pictures
Which is causing all the cramps.
His body is more or less
Fighting itself.
i can just link the pics from the Poniborru page
Give him some Anti-Biotics and move on to next patient.
I could...but it just doesn't seem right for some reason...(But still do-able) Y'all decide
can I ask how old you are?
16.
out of curiosity
aaah...
=P
13Doesnt seem right because of Wrek?
God is a joke.
Can we move on now.
13Or because of the way she looks
13It is a little bit hard to imagine her as a guy
13Lol
I call AppleJack Redneck pony.
just make me the pony of death
Yeah, well you do have to consider that the lotus would look weird on a guy
Foreveral-
IDK why
Guess not so alone.
myfacewhen he's playing that in real life. : D
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/51701
Hugh Laurie does play the piano.
there a bigger picture
13It looks kinda like a ninja star
sure does!
13I dont think it would look that weird
Plus I would have to rethink the name
13Besides, you only have to describe it, not draw a picture
LOL
I called it
3I have to draw a picture
3With words
Hmm
The god kid
13Hmm
Passed Herpes to Wilsons patient.
13Well, I dont think it would do as much to Val if we didnt find a male.
13Lol
Would explain the shrinkage of tumors

13Get the royal list of pony names
No spoilers.
13Translate Blue Lotus into male
2,14 aha! I knew it was spoilers!
I'm just using my medical knowledge to pretend I am part of houses team.
i can be the pony of death right?
2,14 >16....>medical knowledge.....>troll
13What pony of death?
Now watch me be right.
or you have watched the ep before
the pony of death
And realise I have actual knowledge.
like the grim reaper
Nope.
Never Season 2.
Season 1, 5, 6 and 7.
that sends the spirits of dead ponies onto the afterlife
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/51693
season 3's interesting, DuspenDe
13There is a pony of death in our trollfic..?
>mfw we never mentioned it was Season 2
Series Daz, series.
LO
:P*
Season 6 and 7 is still my favourite.
we can make caramel die
ack! sorry dari
Hey, Dari, Luna
2,14 lol, Dermathil's got you there :P
3Thats horrid
The... royal list? :0
Did you guys want me to stress test the shit out of the stream?
3JUST GET THE LIST FOOL
No
FFFFFFF-
We're busy seeing if I'm right.
is that not what we want?
3JK
Ahh.
wikipedia's a wonderful tool
I just learned I have a 100mbit up/down connection probably till tomorrow evening
Wikipedia is for people without actual knowledge.
(it'll be throttled down to 10/10 on Thursday)
No, not kill Caramel.
fine
Just emotionally crush
13Herospirit, we are talking about ValxWrek for now
;__; why's that AllisZero ?
I could probably make a script to open 50-60 tabs of the stream to see how things handle it.
DCD wanted to but he's unavailable
13You could come up with an entirely new name
13Something similar to Wrek
i was talking abou tthat fic
13Like you did with Valerie Jean
13Lol
That's because it's still not ready for production, Daz, so the rules and policies aren't all set up yet
Hello bronystate!
2,14 hello apokalipse
aww that sucks...when will it be set up, then, AllisZero ?
13Also, I noticed a slight error
13It still says "Waitress"
ohai Apokalipse !
hi apokalipse
call
LOLOOLO
3Fine Hero...you've got your mind wrapped around people dying, I WILL FIGURE THE NAME OUT.
Hey Val, Daz, Thunder. I'm here for my House
Actually if I connect a GBic connector with fiber to the one switch I have that supports it, I could probably have a 1Gbit/s connection :p
Let me guess though
ikr Apokalipse ; )
3Oh, well i'd better fix that
It's not lupus
your welcome for that hero
trollface.jpg
Ofcourse it's not Lupus.
Okay, I'm in the loop then lol
"...eventually"
There are NO symptoms that even point slightly towards lupus.
Going home bronies, see yall in a bit
My bet is Herpes Encaphilitis.
13Eh, sorry Denied. Just trying to throw ideas out there
Wat; wat happen
I was watching house. :0
2,14 see ya allis
bb
Wrek is pretty manly...
bye allis
bah bah
Aww man, house is so low, yet his smile, and his genius in deducing that is so awesome. HOUSE Y U SO COMPLEX >_<
How can the name get manlier? WREK?
He is not complex.
He is actually so simple
someone set up us the bomb
Maybe if it was Wrok.
3I could make his name "Reckless"
:0
orlynao
explain DuspenDe
that would do
And predictable.
sounds good
predictable, yes
Elaborate on how he is complex.
i didn't mean from just here, in other scenes too :P
what does my pwnies name get to be?
good vid, DuspenDe, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fRvqR2tPzk
:P
House needs to get back on Methadone.
3I haven't read yours yet, will check real quick
heh
my suggestion, Decapitation Maker
it will make sense when you see what i sent
"pwnies name"?
did i miss the IT crowd?
3That sounds....horrible...
cause ponies pwn
and im a horrible person
Oh, I see XD
Hi DP, I don't know, I just joined
yea DecapPony
exactly
we had pokémon, we had IT crowd, now we have House M.D.
;)
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
gee, calm down
BUT I MISSED POKEMON!
oof low blow son
low blow
3...
=o
God is le fag
/me 3wonders why only his pony ever has flaws....
God is a killer tomato
god is a purple octapus
2,14 that's not how you spell flying spaghetti monster
I must admit. God is probably a killer tomato...
And there it is.
i just made mine sound like my self
Did I miss anything? Internet derped
and suddenly idea
Let me hear it.
Herpes.
3 0_o
Herpes go house
YES
OOOOOOOOOOOOOH YEAH
FEELS GOOD MAN
dude, wikipedia
God is female
you didn't understand the joke, madponyking, right? You weren't around when we watched Attack of the killer tomatoes I guess?
Wikipedia is for people without actual knowledge.
Blues Brothers reference!!
YESS.
YES
OH GOD
nope I wasnt... :,{
FUCK YES...
/me gives Luna socks
I knew it.
haha, but DuspenDe i'm on about 'house episodes' wikipedia, where it explains the final problem
Oh god...
Put them on Dr-Luna
also, thanks for the early spoil, DuspenDe. Really fun... [/sarcasm]
RAAAPE
Well that's cheating.
although, it's not as good as the Pulpfiction one..
It's not really spoiling, because you don't know if it's true yet.
fuck ive been up for 2 hours and im tired
2,14 what he's saying DuspenDe, is that it is incredibly easy to look up the spoilers
Let's watch him prove herpes.
Yes.
But I did not, lol.
LOL
Dad to Son: Son, take off your clothes!
Give us proof of it, DuspenDe.
Anti-Biotics.
then, DuspenDe, i tip my hat to you, sir :P
Prove it I did.
I did*
where is the proof that you didn't look the spoilers up?
I don't have to prove anything to anybody, becaues I know what I'm saying is true.
If you prefer to believe I cheated, then whatever floats your boat.
But WE don't. Try to convince us.
Just because you have no ACTUAL medical knowledge and have to look up diagnosis and cross reference, it doesn't mean everyone has to.
I'm gonna go to bed.
Later.
i prefer to believe you got it, DuspenDe, and congratulations!
Night.
Later.
night
buh-byee
This song :/
yaaay.
What we watching now?
eeyup.
now what?
yay, thanks for streaming that Dr-Luna
Scrubs?
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
YAY!
eeeegh
Wait, waht is this?
This is good!
hmm, haven't ever seen this :P i only hear good things 'bout it
Meh, not a scrubs fan.
2,14 >mfw I've never seen scrubs
oh
the show DOESN'T start well.
I've never seen scrubs either
Never watched Scrubs ever
It's the first episode, though. I've never seen this episode~
It's one of those things where most people like it.
Like Friends. >_>
MFW I dislike both
XD
But then Hipsters are all like: Too mainstream
2,14 I enjoyed Friends when I was younger, but looking back on it...meh...'
dari, I don't think I'm gonna be part of the "like" group. Why? Because the main character looks like an idiot in the first 60 seconds of the episode. Aka, HORRIBLE first impression.
Scubs is usually pretty dang funny
The theme song annoyed me when I was younger
Though I can see where you wouldn't like it.
HAI SCRUBS!
my god this show feels One-dimensional and braindead ALREADY. ABANDON THREAD
I:[
Meh, everyone likes different stuff.
okaaaay...
2,14 I'm just waiting until I see the clip that is in Ponies Anthology :P
yeah, not gonna lie, I don't really like it either
Except for I.T. crowd
Everyone likes I.T. crowd
LOL
...
07at this speed... we're soon running out of IT Crowd :(
:[
NOOOOOO
D:
:(
07Taking idea's though for a replacement
2,14 there are plenty of other shows out there :P
I have good IT Crowd replacement in mind
did i hear ... doctor dorian?
I feel like I want to curl up in the corner and cry the hell out of myself. Because I feel I'm already out of brain bleach.
07do tell?
ARGH these ponies are so hard to pose!
Spaced
:D
Reaver21, pose?
I agree with Payne.
2,14 well, I'm always fond of Black Books <.< >..
I.T. Crowd?
And, Daz, yes.
thx
I've only seen a couple episodes of Spaced, but they were good
very good
The show was brilliant, which is why it's sad it ended with so few seasons
Simon Pegg is Baws
It's Simon Pegg at his best
soooooo
Doc Cox rulez
Erm
So what are we gonna do?
Dat talking
YESH, the janitor
why is it so quiet here?
Well
We are all deep in thought
I guess
XD
2,14 hmm....is the stream lagging for anyone else?
im not
not for me
Nope.
I'm just going to go now~ Yall don't get too lonely without me now.

Hi
ohai Turtaguin

3Eh.
/me is feeling like he should cry because of the inherent stupidity of the main characters, yet he feels that the show is so bad it doesn't even deserve a single tear to be shed
oh wow, that doctor's so cool
Woah, damn connection
Cox is the best.
2,14 ohai denied
hi Denied
Hey Val. I finally begun reading this thing on mspaintadventures...

oh heeeeeeel no!
aw heeel naw
What thing you reading, Denied?
>mfw they are probably all so unprofessional they should all be fired for their lack of professionalism...
2,14 >implying house is professional :P
House is boss
>implying the rest of House's crew ISN'T
2,14 lol, they go along with it!
Because House is boss
And he's more competent than the rest
he always knows it's not lupus
Decap, this is what I have to say to that

It´s Cox! hes the good guy!!
yaaay mr Cox!!!
Similar to Dr. Perry Cox (though it makes more sense in the comedy setting of Scrubs)
/me feels this fails even as a comedy
Sure he's a sarcastic ass that treats his interns like crap, but dammit if he isn't a good doctor, and the interns he trains make great doctors.
2,14 que the "im awesome" song
yeah, it's not as good as the other stuff we watch
oh hey
Hi Škoda!
"I'm awesome"
:3
/me is awesome
2,14 hahaha, you rock dr-luna :P
ooookaaaaay..
2,14 also ohai Octavia
14lol Skoda. Hai thar ponehs
I met all my Bronies online
/me still hasn't seen the original of this song
14I love this PMV <3
mind putting a different show after this song?
as much as I dislike this song, the pmv makes it awesome
fuck, broken link
ohai Silvermane

DAMMIT GOOGLE
ohai mark
ohai Dermathil
ohai everypony
howdy there
ohai silver
2,14 hello silvermane
whassap?
okaaay...
/me is awesome
@sexymeter Silvermane
awww
/me is awesome as well
I think I'm traumatized by the inherent boring comedy/stupidity that Scrubs is filled to the brim with.
eeyup
/me 14is so very awesome too /sarcasism
did Dermathil just dis Scrubs?
2,14 but Octavia IS awesome :P
yes I did, Silvermane.
2,14 crack out dat cello
Dermathil hates the FUCK out of scrubs
Maestro, if you would cue the 'It. Is. On.' Rarity sound
14lol <3
Dari silently dislikes it
true
Because it made me cry for gallons of Brain Bleach.
Škoda, you are awesome no need for sarcasism
xD
and someone else hates it slightly less than Derm, but I forget who
Just so you're caught up, silver :P
Brb
14I wish the Skoda Octavia was allowed in the US, sucks lol
A'ight
2,14 when in doubt, just guess me as apparently I hate everything :P
No u don't
example: You love tridents
samurai applejack!
Alright, Val hates it slightly less than Derm, if I had to guess :p
14lol
play it play it!
:P
WAT
sure
WAT
WAT?!
/me loves him some Scrubs
WAT YOU MEAN WAT
/me hugs madponyking
I'm feeling that Scrubs is the Matt Smith of the Medical shows. Maybe because it is a sitcom whose jokes aren't even funny for trying too hard (and just results in looking dumb)
I approve of this nonsense
/me is hugged and accepts the bro-love
how was that whiskey i gave you?
(yeah, I said Matt Smith.)
Ich bin heir
/me 14is not a fan of Scrubs
2,14 >mfw I can't remember who that is
/me 14hides
/me goes to google translate
no need to hide
who who?
I dislike Scrubs too
Dermathil, most of the jokes are based on older episodes, development of character relationships, and it was a sitcom that just happened to be about doctors
he said i am here
/me is searching for Octavia
I accidentally the internet!
I had whiskey?
where was I....
Oh yes,
Y U ALL HATE ON SCRUBS?!
WAT!?!
yep
play something else besides scrubs
You really do have to watch the whole series to get Scrubs
14XD
Play some pony vids =3
Silvermane, the first sixty seconds of the show made the main character look like an idiot! (the bad kind of idiot)
yeah!
WAT
the Bro-marriage of JD and Turk is worth it alone
and then I did that.
like Pony Champloo or Ponies Anthology
and JD IS the bad kind of idiot
2,14 inb4 sathi trolls with G3 again :P

Don't do tjat, trolling is bad

3Like 2-3 sentances
Ain't speaking about Turbochat
SHE KILLED HIM!
mfw adobe crashed on me
I'm still not sure why we hate Valthejean so much :P

/me 14just sits there and plays WoW :D
@crazymeter Dermathil
6 Dermathil is 13% crazy. (1532)
SILVERMANE GET OVER HERE!
Wait.. Thats not right

/me fell asleep
2,14 GET OUT OF WOW! IT RUINS YO LIFE FOAL!
Which is an improvement over 20% crazy.
/me is not crazy. Just in a bad mood.
eh never mind
/me is chained to the same wall as Decap and Silver.
Chains?
14Dont worry Val. After I'm done showing this computer a good time, I'll give you some attention too. ;)
/me kicked wow for good...it took forever but she got on the pony patch
I'm bound by silk cloth. Spider silk, if the give is any indication
2,14 YOU'D BETTER O_o
/me forbids DecapKing from ever getting a new liver.
14Lmao <3
i dont need one
for I AM THE HIGHLANDER!
Spider silk... keep that. You have any idea how much that hoes for on the AH?
/me quit wow via computer breaking via massive virus overload.
i quit cause i got bored of it
/me takes DecapKing's title of the Highlander away since he doesn't even deserve it.
I never even played WoW.
Kencolt706, I know! And it's the most basic type too
/me unbinds the shackles holding SilverMane, DecapKing, and Pegacorn, gently floating them down and rushing over to Silver for a big hug
And I still want to see 10 million Fluttershys, it's adorable and cute and nice and...
/me binds DecapKing again.
And stuff like that there.
but what about my vodka?
/me hugs MirthTinker. "Hey sweetheart. How are you?"
14Awwww, Seth took down #7 in the Drawfriend Lmao "I thought it was mud" XD
Thank god i'm safe.
He took it down?
It was inevitable...
2,14 well it looks like that from the thumbnail :P
haha
PrincessMolestia, what was #7 again?
Lol PrincessMolestia which one was it?
can someone kill Dermathil for me?

/me then throws him in a river while he's bound to a flipping anvil
MUTED EPISODE

14It was the "Shitty Belle" pic lol
NOW LET ME THE FUCK DOWN!
14I know I shouldnt have, but I giggled at it
Haven't seen it
Here we go!
/me allows DecapKing to go down.
/me "Good, but I'll be better once we're outta here, MR.PEDDINGTON!" Peddington smashes the wall down from the other side, making their exit.

YAY MAAAAAARTHA JONES

My recommendation: Ditch the salad.

Was that Daft Punk? o:

AHM DRUNK

/me likes being tied to walls...

/me is debating whether or not to go buy some snacks at the store...
Rainbow Dash!

Nope.

Physicsssssssssssssssss!
And so Rainbow Dash was fired.

The_Si_BadGui, NO SPOILERS.

Sorry. ._.

I know you wont. *unsheeates hoof blade*
OK. I have seen this one before, but it doesn't change the simple fact that Martha ROCKS there.
She does, KenColt.
"AEIOU"
suddenly soundboard
But what is with the odd lines interjectsed?
you realize i have a katana right SilverMane?
Having a katana don't mean you know how to use it DecapKing.
Damn E.T.
dont worry i do
LOL
Her IDENTICAL cousin!
^^
Phones home and instead gets a repo guy/alien.
wait until the Doctor meets Owlicious
INCOMING SPACESHIPS
Doctor meets Owlicious. Doctor recognises him as an ancient evil alien threat, exposes the plot, saves Equestria, and Spike is all "I TOLD YOU SO!"
>mfw Kencolt sounds like a Owlowlicious hater
YAY
2,14 it's the Lunar Republic!
DecapKing, i can get within the range of your weapon quite easilly. no worries
I want to see that happen in season 2 now haha
Spoilers: This episode has real proper aliens
JUDUUN

OH NO

MFW SPYRO WAS AN INTERGALACTIC HERO
/me brohoofs back
Brohoof back
I like the little shop too
ON THE MOOOOOOOOOOOON
>mfw I remember the episode's twist
Hey...how long is this mspaintadventure thing...?
just wait.
This thing is awesome.
Denied_Existence: Homestuck rigt?
oh shi-
>yfw the man ASKED for it
Denied_Existence: *right. and yes, long webcomic is looooong.
2,14 yes, he asked for it by trying to save people's lives
IDK GGgala
Except they weren't going to hurt anyone...
So far up to the "Medium of gears and fire"
2,14 and made no notice saying so
2,14 they just walked up and started harassing people
2,14 it's VERY easy to get the wrong impression
Please tell me I am like halfway or something...
They are, as the Doctor said, think.
Thick.
Denied_Existence: it's just that there's multiple stories on mspaintadventures.com. Problem Sleuth is pretty manageable.
only one I've finished is Problem Sleuth, loved it
Denied_Existence: if it involves "the Medium," it sounds like Homestuck. i'm still on Act 4.
Its the REALLY long one...
Valthejean, he asked for it by attacking someone who wasn't aggressive. They didn't hurt anyone, they were just putting them through a triage
Or at least I am guessing its the long one...

Denied_Existence: the one with John Egbert lover of terrible movies, right?
>MFIf longer ones exist...
Ohhh.kaaaaay.
Yeah
A radiation fart?
BAREFOOTED ON THE MOOON
lol
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NOT THE SCREWDRIVER
>Stoker
>drinking blood
oh u.
sXe
Oh, she'sGOOD.
LOL, Davesprite...thats a good idea.
NOW she believes.
Or...wait... GGgala_ am I ahead of or behind you?
Denied_Existence: probably ahead. what Act are you on?
what are you guys talking about?
I have no clue anymore
Where I am, John, Rose, and Dave are all in the medium now...
2,14 mfw some god damn salesman just walked into my apartment
HOMESTUCK.
Son, I am proud.
Denied_Existence: waaaay ahead of me
2,14 well I just missed the what...10 minutes of what happened
The doctor os suddenly very kissy these days.
Denied_Existence: Rose JUST entered for me.
And DecapKing, go to mspaintadventures.com
Read it. Do it.
Well I'd better not spoiler
Homestuck/Ponies covers about 80% of my free time.
I don't suppose you read Problem Slueth as well?
Problem Sleuth, btw: http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=4 . it's nonstop lulzy.
my niece and nephew run into the computer room and set some swords behind my back to hold. weird
That's... what, Silvermane?
:0
i can see where they get their weird behavior from
My free time will be eaten up by school work.
dat straw
And she just screwed up.
lol
Dat MW2 nuke noise?
Sadly.
Silvermane: wait... they want you to hold their swords?
they put them behind my neck, between me and the chair
The Homestuck fandom is second best fandom. Number one is obvious. Number one and number two cross over quite often; like someone just posted THIS on the MSPA forums. http://img98.imageshack.us/img98/3455/derpyh.png
fuck you guys im going home
2,14 gnight ziltoid
no
im not going i mean the aliens
lol
>dies of bloodloss
your niece and nephew have swords?
>tries to ressusitate
ah, so you're the human swordrack.
I gave them some old foam swords
Wat
oh
2,14 ah, sorry
padded PVC piping
That wasn't even a real CPR
2,14 I'm completely lost as now twice some assholes decided to walk into my apartment and bother me
Makes sense to me Silvermane.
real CPR causes damage if done righ
right
What show is this ?
Doctor Who.
The Space Police found their alien
dr.who
They killed it
>what show is this
ValtheJean: don't most apartments have a locking door?
>mfw
2,14 they do, but my asshole roommates keep leaving it unlocked
lawl wut
it's raining on the moon! hallelujah
suddenly hospital out of nowhere
Molestia, thats what
I'm free of her
free...
as am i
OH GOD I'M FREE
His story
NO NO NO
Silvermane, did you make the foam swords yourself? :0
nah, stepdad did years ago for me to practice with
although i did make one for real Larping
i used wooden swords to practice with
SAXON
Also, I will say this Homestuck has some awesome fucking music
but now i have real swords
SAXON
practice with hitting each other in the head and arm?
OH SNAP
2,14 seriously, what is with Saxon? Am I supposed to be paying attention to that
Denied_Exisence: Damn straight :0
Existence*
You'll see.
yeah
^^
just wait.
like Anglo-Saxon?
No, the name Saxon.
Mr Saxon
:P
OH THANK GOD, THEY DO A RECAP EVENTUALLY
If there was a man watching me like this in a back alley, I wouldn't go there
Denied_Existence: ikr? dat epic act-closing sequence
Also, tell Pinkie_Pie to read Homestuck sometime, Denied_Existence :P
the dude that plays the doctor?
homestuck fans being second best fandom? idk.. i think the touhou fans might have something to say about that
they NEVER do Recaps, Denied_Existence.
SAXON
I'd go if he promised candy
YES THEY DO...I AM READING IT RIGHT NOW
Silvermane, you are way behind
But I aint spoiling it
i haven't been watching
DARN IT METEOR
i havent either
I WILL SLAP YOU.
/me doesn't know what Homestuck is
ive been listening to fear factory and Chimaira
8legasp*
lol
Silvermane: this is: http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6
inb4 did i mention time machine
what is homestruck?
Homestuck*
NOW she gets it.
READ IT SILVERMANE. DO IT.
hey i'm not saying anything for sure since i actually haven't checked out much.. but then again.. i haven't seen much unwillingly whereas with the touhou fans i have seen that stuff without seeking it out a long time ago
So the doctor is pimpin another lady huh
BIGGER IN THE INSIDE
/me is reading...
i mean i haven't checked out homestuck
So far I've seen Pony fans to be the kind of people who like Homestuck. :0
Dimensional Trancendance. Gotta love it.
so far I've seen Pony fans to like ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING, EXCEPT WHEN THEY HAPPEN TO HATE IT
DURRRRGAAAANNNN
And Meteor, stop crushing my dreams :0
Silvermane: excellente.
I can promise you, unless you read as fast as I do...you will not get to where I am FOR A LONG TIME
Herospirit?
i got bored
Hey guys!
Yahs

Their are no zombies!

i've got a problem with the sound
/me came. again
SweetieDerail.gif
the Shakespeare Code, aside from the opening sequence, is pretty meh
I don't hear anything, yet I refreshed
Ah, but you are wrong TwilightSparkle
I'd say start from the beginning. The plot gets really complex.
I'm missing Dr. Who :<
alright
thanks!

Np
Hey Prince dari play another clip!
Can we have a little Pony before the next episode? :0

/me laughs. Shakespeare would write plays one week ahead of its premier.
And so Shakespeare invents the cliffhanger.
(>has read Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet and Julius Caesar)
I think i'll be watching the Doctor's face pretty much all the time
I read them all, long ago...
It makes the whole thing even more interesting.
Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, A Midsummer's Night Dream
> has only read A Midsummer's Night Dream
No kidding. Dem faces
3:
ETU BRUTI!!!
YOU TOO BRUTUS
Only "Macbeth" and "Romeo and Juliet" for me
And she blows it.
>yfw I read each of the 3 I read for high school, one per year
Finally, they do notice her weird clothes for the time
0Is this a fair portrayal of Shakespeare?
probably
POLITICAL CORRECTNESS GONE MAD
He was a famous pervert
2,14 but I thought he was a butt buddy?
Dat berd
ValtheJean, can't he be both?
He was an EVERYTHING buddy.
That explains a lot...
2,14 I guess
0Shakespeare is now 70% cooler in my book.

0 /If/ that is true.
*Beep* Process now 0.05% complete.
He just drowned from the inside...
I think highschoolers would enjoy Shakespeare more if they understood that half the time he's making jokes about sex and shit :0
Mostly sex.
Herospirit, i started learning shakespeare in freshman year of HS. with Romeo and Juliet
i enjoy shakespeare because of that
and im in high school
we ALL noticed the double intendre of 'ladies heads' in the opening scene
i like it f or "what! you egg!"
/me 0shall now approach Shakespeare with a newfound enthusiasm!
that and "he has killed me mother! *dies*"
I understood it, but even before I did I have to admit I enjoyed it so :P
i liked that I was the only one in my class who knew what a Longsword was
It made me sad my freshman year when only a couple people understood the jokes.
me and the 2 other metal heads got most of the stuff in it
>yfw Shakespeare is one of the most awesome individuals in history
he said to say banana. he must LOVE them
in my class
Shakespeare. Sherlock Holme's eraly incarnation.

2,14 >yfw I only read up to book 5
Wait, didn't that episode come out before Book 7 came out?
too late
GGgala knows what the IMPORTANT death was.
NOT HEDWIG
Dermathil, isn't that the point?
there is a fic for silverman x y
NOW WHO WILL I SHIP TO oWLOWICIOUS
basically everyone
I agree with Herospirit.
Dari, I wasn't sure, that's why I was asking
Val, I only read through 4.
0I read half way through 1
/me has read the entire series. BUt hasn't seen movies past the 5th one. Due to the MISSING DETAILS
XD
0:P
2,14 oh good, then you weren't nearly as corrupted as I was :P
same as Razyn XD
/me read all 7, and was one of the first in his DISTRICT to have read them
DERP
Don't do drugs kid
did he died?
im the only person in my district ot not read them
Don't do kids, drugs
O_O
dat face
Also...I think Homestuck has vague pony ref's
i read Harry Potter in 4th grade, and I was reading book 4 in 6th grade.
Shakespeare's actor is excellent.
his moustache twiches when he writes.
And some not so vague...such as the one I am reading...
D_E; just about everything does these days, so I wouldn't be surprised :P
2,14 inb4 she ends up writing the play that ends up being lost...can't remember what it's called
Shakespeare's writing was pretty raunchy and filled with innuendo, too.
0Shakespeare's cutie mark is an 'oddly shaped feather'
lawl

heeey, what u guys watching
XD
DOCTOR WHOIOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Dr. Who
And Denied_Existence, I wish Homestuck had Pony references, but at least the first 3 Acts came out before Ponies :p

The Midnight Crew intermission is between Acts 3 and 4

0Everyone is crazy about it
It gets very good.
It's dust.

herospirit Eventually you will have a loading screen of the chessboard. That is where I am
But don't worry, its just a loading screen (NO SPOILERS FOR YOU HAHA)
It's ALWAYS the end of the world.
Poopy. I don't remember when that loading screen was. :0
Oh, I've read everything they have so far. So no spoilers for YOU! >:]
Wait...what?
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE!?
:0?
How is what possible? :0
The play is the thing
lol
so.. EVIL theatre.
Didn't you say only two of them were in the medium so far?
No no, that was someone else :P
Oh, well then...
I think that was GGgala

PONY GEAR?!/
Winning
i read pony gear solid
chapters 1 and 2
was pretty good
hope that means chapter 3
next ep please
2,14 all fanfics are shit *trolololo*
I demand final countdown
how aer you allowed to moderate anything
Val I will SMACK YOU DOWN
i agree with SIlverMane
be back soon
ep 3
2,14 yeah cause you know, dari has NEVER trolled in his life :P
...Okay so I don't actually read much fan fiction.
I just had a very wierd thought. Does the Doctor have a hourglass tattoo on his butt?
Of course, Kencolt.
Dat Countdown
So, Valthejean, how far are you in reading Fallout: Equestria?
Thanks Dari. You are THE GREEETEST.
XD
2,14 I finished the amount that was requested of me
XD
No problem.
did you like it?
2,14 and then drank some bleach to forget it
noi
So you read to the latest chapter, Valthejean?
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU VAL!
2,14 no...I read up to 5...because that's what I agreed to
So someone chickened out of the whole deal. WHO DID THAT.
Val, you'll never like a fanfic because you have fundamentally decided not to. :P
2,14 and honestly you should all be very proud of me. Because I WANTED to put it down so badly, but FORCED myself to continue for the sake of fulfilling the agreement
2,14 that's your opinion herospirit, and it's wrong
And for that we thank you.
Mmm. I think that's at least part of it Val. :P
Valthejean, pre-built opinions are what herospirit is talking about, and that's what you had before reading the first 5 chapters.
2,14 I weighed it as I would any published work. And it met every one of my expectations
Which were how low, exactly?
can you play ep 3 of dr. who after this?
Dat countdown...
2,14 actually, they were not as low as you'd think
The singer's hair is going to eat us all
oh, excellent then.
I assume you found it okay then?
2,14 it was exactly what I expected it to be. It was written by someone who had a competant understanding of the English language, which is why so many people mistake it for quality literature
(I mean just "okay")
2,14 but deeper analysis of character development/plot structure and even the author's intention with said novel makes it nothing above even the average literary work
Well, you still only read the first 5 chapters
ya
not much text to evaluate the character development/plot structure obn
ohai Mr. and Mrs. Pie.
i dont get a hi?
@pony Pony Pony
6 Pony Pony is 7Mr Br15eezy
2,14 any author will tell you that within the first 3 (or in this case 5 because I agreed to it) chapters of a novel are supposed to present you with a promise
hi DecapKing :P
HAI DECAP
2,14 a promise of where the story is going, a promise of what you can expect
Hi Decap
@pony Herospirit's love slave
6 Herospirit's love slave is 2The 8Wonder2bolts
2,14 I was unimpressed
>SilverMne
That makes no sense.. Does it?
That's because it is a crossover fanfic.
@pony Thunder_Dash
6 Thunder_Dash is 15Princess 11Ce9le12st13ia

>mfw
I was a pimp.
WHAT
XD
2,14 a crossover fanfic which everyone kept insisting was quality to me
NO, you can't go to the planet of the timelords.
AS IT IS DEAD!
2,14 don't hide behind the fanfic title now that it hasn't been the holy grail you expected
Well, among the other fanfics it IS a holy grail.
exactly
2,14 a polished turd is a turd nontheless
no
If you want to see it like that
it is a polished turd
but yeah, it is a grail made of turd
but it is still a grail
2,14 my point is this is why I disprove of fanfics. Because even the best of it is not worth my time
a turd that was polished so much it was put as the centerpiece of a museum
2,14 amongst several hobos perhaps
EWWWW.
/me has decided to ignore ValtheJean when he comments on anything
2,14 yet never recognized by any actual museum
Can we have a new metaphor please?
and ignore
2,14 and that's the second reason
Enough turds.
>mfw it took Silvermane that long to get to that decision
i just ignored his/her ass
2,14 because when anyone challenges said opinion it's received with hostility
0Hey guys what's-
i honestly hated fanfics
then i read them
/me 0leaves
and now i love them
same
^^^^^ Silermane
and i don't really care why
2,14 I'll put it this way, if you don't want me bad mouthing fanfics, don't talk about them in front of me
Well, Valthejean, It was a metaphor I did. A metaphor where the Museum was EqD
me either
inb4 preachiness
2,14 EqD is a blog about fanfics
also SilverMane your love slave is spike XD
2,14 which in the literary world is the equivalent of (at best) a cult
EQD is a blog about Ponies, including fanfics
That's why I said it was the centerpiece of the EqD museum
EqD is a blog about Ponies :p
Valthejean, a cult of which you are a PART OF
2,14 I like watching My Little Pony. I am not any member of a cult
DAT DOCTOR FACE
Lol wtf just happened there, doc.
lolwut. freeze?
Fine, Valthejean. Stay in your denial phase.
and again a second later?
2,14 care to explain how this is denial?
im pretty sure that Val is just trolling
Eventually you'll come to the evidence that you are a brony by hanging out here, whether you like it or not.
2,14 I never said I wasn't a brony
2,14 the only requirement to be a brony is to like FiM
You said you aren't a member of the cult
2,14 everything else is irrelevant
the cult being the bronies
0What are we arguing about, and is it really that important?
He meant the cult being fanficers actually
we are a cult!
Eh
I don't agree with him, but don't twist his words :p
2,14 thank you herospirit :P
AND NOW I OVER WITH ACT 4!
~yay~
eh
I ain't twisting his words

http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/08/animation-reel-with-few-seconds-of.html
What?
i do
Valthejean, they breathe from the exhausts, but that doesn't mean they have FOOD
you know, a mars bar once in a while
Dermathil, it said the exhaust WAS food
Because they are very very dumb, Val.
2,14 I thought he sad they fed on it?
and they probably kill because they are insane from de-evolution
Yah big ol' face
They feed on the exhaust gas the same way WE feed on air
or how a plant feeds on solar energy

2,14 why silver....why....
Hey Val.
because it bugs you
14Not enouhg secret butt fun goin on here it seems.
2,14 yeah dari?
Why is your fanon superior to fanfiction then? They are essentially the same thing.
2,14 fanon=/= fanfic
SilverMane wants to have secret butt fun!
dari is starting shit!
It's always me.
SHHHH DECAPKING
14lol
I support you Dari!
2,14 I don't dislike fanfics because of it being fanon
I wish you would keep your butt fun a bloody secret...
2,14 I dislike them because they are _awful_ fanon
Well I was arguing that all fanfics suck not that long ago.
/me 14is always up for secret butt fun
Lawl.
im always up for getting drunk
So your fanon isn't awful?
Simply because you made it?
2,14 yes, yes it isn't :P
LOL
BARK LIKE A SEA LION
AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW YEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH
14LMAO
2,14 your point isn't really clear and/or well made

http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/photos/images/newsfeed/000/167/843/GOOFY%20TIME.png?1314582622
/me passes out
My point is that your fanon is just as awful as any other fanfics.
:P
2,14 well that's just you trying to troll me :P
2,14 besides, without fanon we wouldn't have Derpy and Dinky
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
And without fanfiction we wouldn't have cupcakes.
....
why
You masy stop there.
2,14 yes, heaven forbid what would happen without cupcakes :P
Dari, you're not helping yourself now
>implying Derpy or Dinky are important
by the way, Dinky being related to Ditzy is fanfiction in origin
just like Midnight and Nyx and shipping
>mfw you're saying all other fanons are awful yet you are thankful for creating Ditzy and Dinky
2,14 I highly doubt that
i just dreamed that i was chained to the wall again....
>hear gunshots
>go upstairs unarmed
>don't run away and call police
STOP SPOILING IT!
Okay. Odd show...
2,14 also derma I never said all other fanons are awful...
well, YOU JUST DID
Run up and PUNCH THE SHIT out of the guy with the gun
Jonathon Creek has mindblowing realisations in this show.
That's what you told Dari a minute ago!
2,14 *sigh* once again. FANFICS=/= FANON
Greater than House realisations, which is saying something.
:P
<ValtheJean>: I dislike them because they are _awful_ fanon
Soooo, is it a murder mystery show?
2,14 yeah, and I was refering to fanfics
>all fanfics are awful
yeah well fanfics created Ditzy and Dinky's personalities
>dislike them because they are awful
Sense much make?
2,14 To be fair, I hold nothing of derpy/dinky's personality a part of fanon, only their relationship
2,14 further more (and again) I highly doubt that derma
so... the guy who paints giant naked clown ladies has been murdered. Why is this not surprising?
disliking awful things makes sense, but them being awful due to disliking doesn't
@ValTheJean Sense:You Make None
2,14 when the hell have I ever said that? good fucking god
/me wishes the conversation would be dropped already
Val, you's gettin ganged up on
2,14 honestly I don't mind that, I just wish my words weren't being misinterpretted >.<
/me is tired of this circular argument where everyone goes over the same points repeatedly
Herospirit Now I must attempt to decide if the trolls are supposed to relate to something...
What do you mean by "relate to something"? :p
i gave up watching the show on the stream, and just went back to my metal
Talking about Homestuck, before anyone asks :P
Val, you hate all fanfics, you hate them because they are bad fanon, why are they bad fanon, because all fanfics are inherently bad.
Sense make much?
2,14 see, now you're twisting my words
makes none to me
That's just what you said.
:P
2,14 no, that's just how you chose to construct them :P
2,14 they are literally without merit
I have no clue...just speculating for some reason
Don't worry Dari, I am writing a fan fiction JUST FOR HIM
Throughout my career, I've always been able to recover very quickly in the face of the bizarre, but there is a great difference between a floating psychic in a gas mask reading my PlayStation save data and waking up in a barn apparently owned and operated by a red horse with an apple tattoo on its ass.
Aint I so nice?
I suspect that we have met the detective of this show.
Now I could illegitimise my whole arguement here.
And I really want to.
http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/entries/icons/square/000/006/137/130856000524.gif?1308599498
Because it's such an awesome way to do it.
2,14 lol, you kind of already did with the cupcakes thing :P
http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/entries/icons/square/000/006/137/130856000524.gif?1308599498
Ok.
Okay, what Dari means to ask I believe, is if not all fanon is bad, why is all fanfiction bad?
Cupcakes was a work of art
Here we go.
I LOVED cupcakes, once my head stopped screaming with pain
Cupcakes was actually fairly good
http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/entries/icons/square/000/006/137/130856000524.gif?1308599498
DecapKing, stop it.
You're spamming.
Fanfiction is properly justified as a legitimate source of speculation of characterization and entertaining extremities.
2,14 legitimate how?
that*
2,14 to be fair dari, you missed an important part :P
Lol, I just threw a bunch of buzzwords together just then...and still sounded like I knew what i was saying...
2,14 because that's what was said before
actually, dari hasn't illegimized his argument. He basically explained the WHOLE FUCKING ISSUE in four lines.
(Not that I don't know what I was saying)
And I thank you GREATLY for that.
2,14 and then the offer for me to read FO:E, the supposed example of a good fanfic was offered
2,14 superfluous offer much? oiy...
2,14 I think this is a fair way to leave this conversation:
FO:E was pretty good. Actually written like a book.
honestly, in mathematics a single point does not a function prove
Val, if fanon isn't all bad, why is fanfiction all bad? Is it just a massive coincidence that only the bad fanons get written down?
Valthejean, you are basically acting like the people who watch FiM and in the first 5 minutes decide that the show is SHIT because it is about ponies. Except you find that the story is SHIT because it is a fanfic
^^
2,14 present to me an example of a good fanfic, and I will retract my statements of it
Black and White
:P
SIRS IT IS ALL ABOUT PERSONAL OPPINION, PLEASE DO NOT TRY TO FORCE YOUR OPINION ON OTHERS!
read that
World of Ponycraft.
Bamn, headshot
LOL
2,14 well then that completely nullifies the entire point of the discussion dari
Dem police
In fact, I still need to read that
So polite and British.
/me thinks that crossovers and Adventure-fics are bad ways to indoctrinate into fanfic enjoyment
Don't want to make a scene in the cinema while people are watching a film.
I seriously want to know if you have a theory on why fanfiction is always bad if fanon is not, ValtheJean
2,14 herospirit: because I've seen good fanon, and I have not seen good fanfiction
but I mean
Oooooooh, I want this theory too...I must catalogue it in my files on psychology.
Er...cause...you know...keeping files is entirely normal.
Well it is irrational to assume that all fanfics are bad, because it is near impossible that there's not a single one in existence that you wouldn't enjoy.
http://ts1.mm.bing.net/images/thumbnail.aspx?q=1058433935464&id=ddf68fc9dbb76df2d5d1243971497662&url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.ponychan.net%2fchan%2fpic%2fsrc%2f130236442832.png YOU ARGUING MAKES FLUTTERSHY CRY!
2,14 it's as irrational to assume there IS one I would enjoy :P
And if there isn't one now, there will be one eventually!
2,14 considering the very nature of a fanfic frustrates me
Valthejean, I guess you should include comics in fanfiction btw. Because it is a story, except it is expressed in image form rather than with words.
ValtheJean: but I mean, if you have a theory on this, WHY is all the fanfiction bad? If good fanon exists, why do only bad ones get written down?
Because, the likeliness that a fan fiction you will like never ∞:1
2,14 derma: no, the comic book industry is not included in literature, so I will use similar basis
*never appearing is ∞:1
Wait... let me get this straight. You are arguing that fanfics are bad-- all bad-- by virtue of BEING fanfics?
He doesn't mean comic books, he means MlP fan comics
>mfw my literature teachers say the EXACT opposite of what Valthejean says
2,14 no kencolt, just that they frustrate me
/me FOR FUCKS SAKE DROP IT ALL OF YOU
And why do they frustrate you?
2,14 well then it's different in your country than here derma
(actually, that's exactly what he means, Kencolt.)
PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!
/me I AM A VERY CALM PERSON AND YOU ARE ANNOYING ME VIA TEXT FOR GODS SAKE
14I MAD!
Silvermane.... U mad, bro?
2,14 sorry, then your teacher was wrong. As that is not how the industry works
Herospirit, don't start.
I apologize.
/me NO MORE ARGUING. MOCK THE DAMN MOVIE, TALK ABOUT PONIEs, AND SHUT THE FUCK UP
2,14 but, seeing as how this is frustrating silvermane, I suggest we leave this discussion for a time he is not online
this argument, making me homicidal
/me growls and climbs up into the dark rafters
Really, no sarcasm, I actually apologize. I should've dropped this a while ago.
ValtheJean By my calculations (Minus the random chance of a sudden life-ending event), the likeliness that a fan fiction you will like being created is bordering the 87% level.
And thats allowing for any number of earth-rending event...
alright then
Yay scientific calculations!
So much fun
I see a murder coming up.
Also, did you know the likeliness that somepony would eventually create cupcakes is nearly 68%?
The easiest murder ever :P
No, I do these calculations myself
But... you can't calculate infinite time.
Did you guys know that the likelihood of people creating proper aspect ratio wallpapers is 0%? :(
Although it does involve a lot of guesswork.
herospirit No, but I can allow for it.
Dashite actually, its 0.054792% *trollface*
Actually, you can calculate for infinite time. It just takes really really long.\
What timespan did you use? If you assumed infinite time, all probabilities would be 100%. :0
using approximation as x approaches infinity tactics?
did you know the likelyhood of PrincessMolestia chaining ponies to walls is 100%?
>I want to lie beside her in a bath of warm glue
Damn you Denied. :p
Wut
dat glue
OKay-- anyone that clueless HAS to be a great detective.
1920x1080 is so easy to create by cropping a proper 1920x1200. :(
DON'T BE USING YER FANCY MATHEMATICS TO MUDDY THE ISSUE D<
herospirit, that would require the assumption that humanity lived for infinity...which I calculate only a maybe 3.475x10^-245 chance of.
> mfw my headset is plugged into charge and it starts beeping as if it's running out of battery

OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? LET'S TALK ABOUT PONIES.
Who is everyone's favorite ponies?
Although, I suppose you could take into account the likeliness that an afterlife or re-incarnation exists...but those calculations are WAY too wild for me

I dunno my favorite. Maybe Twilight. Possibly Fluttershy.

I'm kindof torn between Twi and Flutters myself.
But the odds are cool....
I always like my odds even one against a million, shouldn't be confusion cause I've never been a villain, don't know what to call me you can call me what they call me back home-

Come on! Give me something to calculate! I dare you!

REMEMBER: If the odds are ever exactly one in a million, then it is guarenteed to happen!
Because this is the first episode it's longer than they normally are.

You also asked first...

OH MY GOD
Then he explains it.
And ruins the moment.
You can argue logic all you want, but you still thought about it for a finite amount of time. And even if you don't care now, you cared enough to ask wether you cared or not.
FUCKING MAGNETS
And therefore you cared.
Also, that thought about caring or not extends backwards to near infinity
He is the greetest.

Soo... he lives in a windmill. That's almost pony-like.
His parents live in Phillydelphia
i think its spelled Fillydelphia
I think you may be correct Val, but reaching 100% requires some more calculations...give me a second and I can figure out whether it was .00001% more than you thought.

Lulz
my mom doesnt even give a shit that im still up
not a single fuck was given that day
*EXTREME.HEADBANG*
both of my parents know about both A) ponies and B) my erratic sleep schedule
Hell, my mum pretty much keeps the same sleep schedule as me.
i don't think they really care about either except when I end up spending the whole damn day in bed P:
My sister in law thinks I'm insane because I watch this show... and doesn't even notice my huge old school anime collection. :P
Tell her she should watch it
I'd dance for you to this video.
I have.
Pony swag perhaps?
cool song, brp
>brp
Love me some Swag
Not a bad tune after all.
ooh yes
pony swag
do it
yussss
~yay~
There's a project of some bronies rewriting Beatles songs to ponystyle out there...
Yes, on Youtube... I forget what the channel name is.
14Bleh, my suggestion got ignored.
Next, either Like a BAWS or Sexy, Naughty, Bitchy.
Or Sgt. Pinkies Lonely Hearts CLub Band.
or Baby god Flank
>god
got
That is an actual song, by the way...
No fluffy, that is a horrible idea.
14Okay, now you're just playing it to humor me. lol
14Aww, thats not the PMV. But its still a good song.
NotSureIfHeadbang.jpg
10 million FLuttershys has a PMV...
14Its based off the fanfic. Which I've not read. But still like the song.
OH REALLY?
14Oooh.
And isn't THAT a cue?
Need some LIKE A BAWS aswell
Already played it today
Is she trying toeat her hoof?
Wait...so I ALREADY MISSED IT!?
Not bitchy-- whiny.
Darn...
Eeyup
I love that strut
The ironic part is we can all watch any of these whenever we want-- on Youtube-- but we can't make bad and often perverse jokes about them.
YOU SHOULD NOT GO
ADAPT
2,14 awwwwwww
DONT LEAVE US DARI!
EVOLVE INTO A MOLE OR BAT
Okay :3
14Dari, did you play Rainbow Factory just so I wouldnt whine? :P

2,14 >mfw I still haven't done any of my homework
night dari
haha Val, same here, I had a bunch of unfinished work I was supposed to do over summer and I barely did any
2,14 I suppose since there's no stream, and CERTAIN people are off playing WoW...I might as well do it now
I'm probably just going to stay here as I have nothing to do and don't feel like going to bed yet
2,14 so yeah, I think I'll be off too. I'll most likely go to sleep when I finish so I'll see everyone in the morning
I am going to switch to a client though, so I'll be right back :P
'Night Val
2,14 good night all, make sure to post ponies while I'm gone :P
I'm going too. Goodnight.
ALSO, FEAR NOT, FOR VAL FICTION IS IN THE WORKINGS
XD
*EVILLAUGH*
Hi Decap
so DecapKing, when did you cease being a mere DecapPony? I missed the coronation!
6SPRINKLES OUTTA FUKKEN NOWHERE
ohai SirSprinkles
14lol Hai thar Sprinkles outta fucken nowhere!
So, who's in charge of this little shindig?
Me
Is it safe to assume you will be streaming season 2 when it starts?
Yes
would you mind if I mentioned it in a sticky somewhere over in /pony/ at your convenience?
Or are you hoping to avoid the swarms that that would release upon you?
speaking of which, is there going to be a stream of S1 before S2? I remember someone asking that during... I think the first LoTR movie
Wouldn't bother me at all. *Note: I'm not actually in charge of anything around here. I just lurk all the time.*
I had guessed that might be the case. :P
It seemed awfully convenient.
Dari and Sprinkles would be the ones in charge.
And are they currently online?
How would I go about contacting them?
Well, they are currently listed as being in the channel.
14Dashite isnt in charge of this place. :P
I know, but if he lurks here, he might be of SOME use
Sprinkles has been idle for the last 10 minutes and Dari for longer than that.
Dari's bot is always here to the best of my knowledge, and I think Sprinkles is here
Dari
Dari
Dari
Dari
Maybe that will get his attention.
14As for mentioning it over on pony, thats fine.
Oh, I mean in a sticky
14Its not secret really we plan to be live streaming S2 as it airs. :P
Hi Decap
im going to be away from chat while im doing my homework
14You mean its own sticky?
sort of
edit in the link into the existing sticky in pony
6...what's going on now?
You're in charge of this?
14I thought we already had a link in the existing thread.
6Yes.
14Its a group effort. lol
6Well, there are three admins that run it, Octy.
Oh, I'm RainbowDash, the mod over at ponychan
14Well, I like to think of it as a group effort still.
6-_-; It is, Octy, but regardless...
I just wanted to know if I could add a link to this stream in the OP of the existing sticky in pony
6One moment.
whats going on?
6I have no problem with it. If something comes up where the other admins disagree, which I doubt, I'll make sure to contact you to ask to take it down.
6Though again, I doubt that'll happen.
14Hmm...
okay, my main concern is that you might not be able to take the full load that that would bring upon you
who's the anon?
I don't know anything about how this is all set up, mind you
!!RainbowDash ##Mod#, over at ponychan
6We're already preparing setup for a rather large amount of traffic come season 2, so it would only be helpful.
I probably should have set my name as something useful. ._.
well im DecapKing
AKA DecapMan, xxHeadremoverxx, etc
Hello there
ive also been called Lucifer, Satan, Diablo
nifty
super keen
6But yeah, I have no problem with it, and would appreciate it, and see no reason the other admins would have issue with it either, since we'd only be pushing for it at a later date anyway.
so, I have the go ahead?
6Go for it.
any other info you would like me to add?
altough i will not wait till i can devour your sould
*soul
what time you'll be streaming, or whatnot?
6We'll be streaming the episodes live as they come out.
probally whenever the episodes come on
so roughly 6:30pm eastern
14I said that already, but y'know...
or whenever it comes on
6Yes Octy, I'm just confirming.
14When they first air.
It never hurts to confirm anything
14We're streaming that 8am or such one right?
14I think it plays twice that day.
6Whatever time it is, yes.
9am saturday morning.
14On the 17th.
6Again, everything live as it comes out.
alrighty then
> mfw realize in order for me to see them live I need to get up before 6 in the morning
I'll go start on that
thanks for your help!
6np
6Thanks for checking with us.
You're welcome. :)
6...-_-;
You are welcome
see you in hell
6...-_-;
Hey, someone had to keep him company until you mods showed up!
14Dashite lol
14Well, people ignore me anyway. lol
13Noticeable colors go!
:p
thats cause you ignore us by playing WoW.....
6You're a new mod, Octy, of course people ignore you.
13This is true Decap. lol
AND YOU CHAINED ME TO A BLOODY WALL!
Holy crap, Octy is a mod?! I didn't notice.
13lol
XD
6...-_-;
Wow, thanks for the information Sprinkles! I'll be sure to give my congratulations next time I see Octy around here!
I can tell, just cause I'm not using mibbit :P
Next you'll be telling me that ValtheJean is a mod. Heh, like that would ever happen. Haven't seen him around talking much lately...
13Lmao
uhhhh
13Hes trollin
sadly, the archdemon is
also so am i

DecapKing
I don't mean to impose by asking this again, but I know somepony asked at some point during one of the LoTR streams if there were any plans to stream Season 1 as a whole before Season 2, are there?
6>implying we haven't already streamed all of S1 in one day
6...we might though, need to discuss it.
That wasn't implying any such thing. :/
6Can't give a definite yes or no.
well, I only really heard about this because of the LoTR stream, so if it was it was before then
It was several months ago.
http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/3bff959307e1b483f51d6033be4b2a0d/52157%20-%20anger%20celestia%20comic%20fluttershy%20luna%20twilight_sparkle.png
13Luna: FUUUUUUUUUUUUU...
13I'm so Fluttershy.
I'm fine without an answer, I was just curious as to if there was one yet :P
I'm Celestia.
6>several months
6>it was the end of July
Was it that recent?
6>just a little over a month ago
6We did it July 25th.
Yes, yes it was.
I remember that now.
I remember missing the first 9 episodes because I was in class.
6I remember being here for all of them.
6Because I'm a mod.
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/52041
I remember being here, I just don't always remember when they were.
if there's another one, I plan on being here, but what time would it be likely to start at, if you don't mind me asking?
The last one started at 12:00 noon EST.
taking time differences into account, if there's another one, I can manage that
You're PST right?
Yeah, so it'd be 9AM for me
hey everyone
hi Synros

Bye Trollight.

Did you type that as "... okay then" or
yah there are... they were used to get rid of all the humans
"...okay then"
you mean with or without a space? Typed it with one
That's what I thought.
I should get rid of that part of the script...
huh?
The script I have that allows me to do this:
Huzzah
Or...
Er...
.. / -- . .- -. / - .... .. ...
Also automatically trannslates morse code in others posts.
Oh, okay
And if you just put ... alone somewhere it'll remove all the spaces in the rest of the message. :p
Ah, I see. :P

hmm

sounds like its going to be a copy of the first 2 episode, but with a guy this time :(
yeah, that's kinda the impression I got too, but I'm hoping that's not what happens

5Thunder_Dash: you jsut need the rihgt motivation, FOR LUNAR REPUBLIC

wait a second!!!!
5*ill have the chinese gut punch, hold the punch add the gut*
this drink says Brazilian Punch. but its made in the USA...
wtf!?
http://verydemotivational.memebase.com/2011/08/26/demotivational-posters-honesty-2/
you got punched my a chinese Wrek?
5its a drink in Deus Ex, and the bartender responds with, the punch or the drink?
lol
5i chuckled when i first heard it
hows the game?
5*giggle*
its just the name that...gets me
5lets see, Deus Ex is in short, FAN-FUCKING-TASTIC!
5yeah that sounds about right
so...day of sex is fan-fucking-tastic!?
ok...
5aye
5but yeah Synros, definetly worth getting
is there a trail or demo or something I can get first. Im very picky on video games
like I bought Duke Nuke and returned it the same day I hated it
http://verydemotivational.memebase.com/2011/08/23/demotivational-posters-balls-6/
everyone said it was a great game, so I bought it
bleh
Everyone said Duke Nukem was a great game?
Where?
I honestly cannot remember
some friends, and a couple websites said it was wortht he buy
I only played the demo, but yeah, DNF wasn't that great (though it's just about impossible to live up to 13 years of expectations anyways :P)
I had fun with it, but I wouldn't exactly call it a great game.
the only game ive played and actually stuck to is WoW, and its been 6 years now
http://verydemotivational.memebase.com/2011/08/21/demotivational-posters-socialising-2/
5Synros: duke nukem is a poor example
5becsuae it sucked balls
5i can hook you up on some deus ex trailers/demos later
5im sure that you'll love it
i think OMFGCata is still doing a Deus Ex playthrough, I will go watch that too
5just dont watch enough to spoil it for you
yah on seconds thought I won't. I do that all the time
thinking about it, I think the only games I haven't spoiled for myself are the Ace Attorney games, Portal 2, and Hotel Dusk (which I haven't finished yet)
*spoiled the endings of before finishing
http://verydemotivational.memebase.com/2011/08/18/demotivational-posters-or/
I spoiled all of Cata.
but Im going to try not to spoil the new Xpac this time
5but yeah Synros ill hook you upi later
kk wrek
even though the new Ace Attorney game is only in Japanese I'm trying not to spoil the ending for myself(I've played through most of it in japanese and from my extremely limited understanding I have a few guesses as to what might be going on, but still)

I love campus wi-fi networks
There just aren't dead spots.
I could be down on the shore of the lake and have this connection.

Only reason I DCed earlier was that I put my compy in sleep mode to go around campus until I set back up.

Thank you God.
I'm thinking the bot was a Proxy User
...

That's quite specific
6lol I already banned him bro.
Damn proxy users and their....... proxies
I know, not what I meant to do.
Just banning the nick,.
Since he rejoined with the same one last time.
So, what have you guys been up to?
6TF?
6Why are all of our bans gone?
Probably got whiped during server downtime.
6There we go.
What the flying fuck?!
That many?!
6Yeah.
Wow...
WOW thats alot of bots
Well expect it to get about 10x as big when S2 starts.
6Not all bots.
:)
6In fact very few bots.
I remember our first spam bot.
Ahh.
Derpy.
You got your work cut out for you with the trolls and bots then, right Dari?
Is there a reason why the chat log is underneath the stream and not to the right of it? just asking.
It was pretty good because it spammed semi related stuff.
Morning guys
UKBrony, you're using Firefox?
But it failed because it spammed to the point of being DCed due to flooding, broke the message buffer I suppose.
mornin', AllisZero
If so, just click outside the chat, press Ctrl and scroll out
No,chrome
Should do the same
Actually, Rodman, not that many bans.
Rodman: this works in Chrome too, even if you're in the chat
Press ctrl, scroll out, it will realign itself as it zooms out
Thanks!
So where in the UK are you?
also, UKbrony, top right you see the tool? click it, and you'll see 'ZOOM.'
Wiltshire, are you in the UK?
FreezeFrame, yeah, but then again I'm easily impressed by numbers
to the left and right of 'ZOOM' are + and -
Daz, I derp
Eeyup, I'm in Reading.
how did you derp, Rodman ?
No, I mean I tend to derp, so yeah
i'm in Reading too! I also love in Running and in MountainClimbing, and my most favouritest thing is in Ponies
xD
I have to travel a LONG way to go Mountain climbing -_-
Dari
My Twilight must be one of the most traveled ponies out there.
?
I have to head out, apparently I'm needed at home.
Probably won't be back for the interviews today because of it...
dari, wait till summer's over - my Fluttershy will travel from south spain, across spain, over sea, into England :P
also, my RD if i get it later today
Ok.
I'll check the forums frequently though, so just make sure Sathi posts them there.
aaaaand brb lunchtiemz :P
Well, my Twilight will have traveled the highest most likely. :P
i come back.. to- hey daz!
soz lunch nao brb
alright
Yeah Sathi will, she seems to do pretty much all the interviews solo now. :/
Everyone else has kind of left them to her.
*sniff* the shut-in finally seeing the world
Well, I'd like to sit in on them, but I NEVER have the time anymore... >>;
Yeah,
I understand.
Not exactly a complicated process though, so I don't care too much.
Alright, heading out.
Talk later.

That's because Gurren Laggan isn't about the mecha

The mecha are incidental.

Yeah, but it's for advertising.
He put the site link in a sticky.
10yeah but I'm gonna be gone in 3 weeks anyway :L
10nice
lol sounds like yall got something against em
10no meteorventure, I /personally/ don't like the place
10nothing to do with bronystate or anything, just RBD
alright.. what for if i may ask?
Any particular reason?
10just meh
I find the place to be alright
Lol, I don't like it either.
10meh in its entirety
It's full of drama.
That's all I'm saying.
10I can't explain it, but it's just the whole imageboard mentality and the type of crowd imageboards attract
10it's not my scene
I like Ponychan, but really EqD, Bronystate and Ponibooru are my main soures for pony
10and sooo many people take ponychan SOOO seriously
>come back >Gurren XLR.
ya i pretty much just think the place is alright.. i used to like it alot but i don't go there much anymore and don't find much to do there atm
/me brohoofs Rodman
Hell yeah Gurren XLR!
/me brohoofs back
now find me 'Libera Me From Hell' to XLR clips :P
i figure it will pick up in some ways during season 2.. i plan on checking out some threads right after some episodes and all
Sorry Daz, can't please you there

10damn it daz xD hope you get it soon anyway
Thanks, man.
My father WILL become a Brony ... :P
um, i mean, uh, i-if it's alright with him
did anyone see that splatterpaint wallpaper?
for pinkiepie and twilight
I haven't
Link please?
sure man
so uh, it's bloody fantastic, and it's also the wallpaper for my phone now =D.
tbh these chatrooms USUALLY have the type of people i don't like in them.. it highly depends on the chatroom though and rarely i will find someone i like.. then again that's kinda like everywhere else ever
see, androids have a scrolling background when you go from page 1 to 2 or 3, so i can have long wallpapers, it's awesome :P
...dunno if i explained myself
Pretty clear Daz
yay~
And DAT WALLPAPER
I agree, its awesome
Well, a ton of people are complete asshats. You'll find then everywhere.
ya basically.. but even nice people i sometimes don't like hanging around simply cause i don't have the same interests
love 'n' tolerate
also, i downloaded 'best of pony music vol. 1' gonna listen to it later :P
who seriously is like that? oh wait.. me
Meh, if all your friends are alike and have the same interests isn't that a bit boring?
muahaahah
It's interesting when people are different.
Hey Daz
People good at different things, they like different things.
Kamina and Coop as Gork and Mork

hmm
Kamina stillbetter, but COop pretty rad
MeteorVenture, ya can talk to me bro

Somepony's trying to stir up drama in /pony/
funny story, from school with a maths teacher, we had a derail on religion, and i'm normally one of the more discussing ones in class :P
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pony/res/35777862.html#i35793859
i think saying all religion is wrong is a pretty limited way of thinking.. what if my religion was that i spilled milk on someones shoe and then they didn't believe me cause it was a religion? then they start to feel their foot get wet
me: Why do you hate religion, and not just leave it along? teacher: religion causes so many wars me: wha about the owther wars. him: ... money. me: ya not gonna use money either then xD xD. him: GTFO. and then i had a detention :3
yah Meteor, but milk doesn't cause people to do questionable things
lol srs
well exactly! thanks for proving my point

That was not me

I never post as anonymous
well I g2g do some things for a bit. "cash a week old work check..." I'll be back in a couple hours
:D
ok then Flutteryay i thought it would be you :D
i am having trouble explaining my point lol
bai bai Synros
oh you don't believe me? Well check my IP and that poster's IP then
MeteorVenture, you explained it fine. 'pretty limited way fo thinking' says it all
alright well thanks!
Flutteryay, i mean i thought you would do something like that, but now I see it was not you :P
and take care synros:D
k
aaniways sorry MeteorVenture, i'm gonna watch a movie i haven't seen yet, so no music just yet : /. P'haps later today or something
Sorry Daz, someone walked in to discuss something with me
I'd never do that. The mods here are awesome
alright lol.. what's the movie?
inception?
MeteorVenture 'havne't seen before' :P. Inception was movie night, and even then i had seen it. nah, it's called '500 dayso f summer '
orly? ok well i didn't watch that here.. i saw that recently though and it's awesome
but never seen 500 DOS either
hahaha, 500 DOS xD
hope dari gets it "You would not believe your eyes, if five hundred MS-DOS, crashed in an office as I fell asleep"
:P it wasn't actually intentional this time
c'mon that's pretty funny :P
still, good job, MeteorVenture
thanks lol
LAWL the movie is funny already
If 500 MS-DOS crashed in an office the last thing you'd get is sleep
ikr AllisZero
haha
10nice one, who's the little smart-ass who posted that on ponychan? trololo
was it you?
:P
Alright, gonna be afk. Working on permissions on my shares
also, i'm still asking: I just got an android phone, with market, etc. What's good stuff to get for it?
(market being android's 'appstore')
and another question: would you all rather have Rainbow Dash brushable, or 1/2/3 Blindbag ponies?
why brush what's not broken?... wait
HAHA oh man! MeteorVenture, I recommend this movie already. i'm not gonna talk about it anymore, as running commentaries are annoying, but it is one funny film, as reviews say it is :P
i have fluttershy brushable, and today i'm either gonna get blindbags or rainbwodash brushable :3
i have no toys ;_;
do ya want any? would your parents be ok with it? are there any near you?
i live in a trailer with no pony toys ;_;
are there any near you thou? any shops you might pass?
14:43] <MeteorVenture> i think saying all religion is wrong is a pretty limited way of thinking.. what if my religion was that i spilled milk on someones shoe and then they didn't believe me cause it was a religion? then they start to feel their foot get wet
[14:43] <Daz> me: Why do you hate religion, and not just leave it along? teacher: religion causes so many wars me: wha about the owther wars. him: ... money. me: ya not gonna use money either then xD xD. him: GTFO. and then i had a detention :3
I don't blame my dad.
lol ya.. my parents are divorced but my mom already knows i like all this.. she doesn't even mention it
If I were him I'd probably feel the same.
He's from Iran.
Where religion is forced on you and if you don't like it you get executed.
So...
Yeah.
and, my point wasn't 'you must do relition' it was 'if you don't like it leave it alone, not hate it : /'
religion *
10it's pointless to even discuss religion
My point is that he has reason to hate religion.
oh, but it's so fun
And I don't blame him.
oh ya i wasn't attacking your dad or anything.. he could be a really cool dude for all i know.. i just had something to say about what he apparently thought
what's his reason Dari?
I told you?
(again, just taking oposite sides to provide juicy conversation, tell me if ya want me to stop) He's from Iran, so he hates every single religion known to man?
dat juiciness
Well he hates that one in particular, but the rest he thinks are just bullshit anyway.
waitwait we're discussing your dad. want to talk about you? or something
Ya, i'm feeling lazy, i cba to carry on arguing today
*yawn*
aww.. i was gonna talk in depth about it with you too
aha
well, i can try and convince a small part of me to work xD
ok, i'll try. shoot, MeteorVenture
i was gonna wait for the movie to end though lol
nah, dual screen, man!
watching + headphones on right, bronystate chat on left
and also i wasn't going to talk about it in the main chat since it just feels odd
Well, whatever you want ^_^
10again, religion is pointless to discuss :L thousands of years of false hope, idiocy and brainwashing, nty <3
So...quite the CMC FiM episodes for tomorrow, huh
10it's always CMC episodes XD
yea, RainBroDash, but that's, like, your opinion, man
and yay so much CMC fri
10Daz my opinion is always fact ;D
10such is life in my little world
;D ikr RainBroDash ikr
contrary to popular belief, you ARE the center of the world. of the UNIVERSE. so (to quote a videogame) "The world ends with you. If you want to enjoy life, expand your world. You gotta push your horizons out as far as they'll go.!
same character from vidya: "Enjoy the moment with all your might...whether it’s gloomy, whether it’s bright! " "Knowing it in your head doesn't mean much if you don't act on it. " "Enjoy every moment with all ya got. "
10I still would like to know who tried to stir up shit on ponychan :<
haha
10Just so I can know /why/ they'd want to
why.jpg
who seriously uses the backspace button thing?
to go back a page?
10XD
10I definitely have done before, but nowhere near as much as I have done accidentally
10suxx doesn't it.
exactly.. me too
I do often, so when it happens by accident, i slap myself
hey errybody: CTRL ALT UP
now that you know that, press: CTRL ALT DOWN
so i told ya how to reverse the DOWN thing. :P so try it out \o/
10yfw I disabled that
mfw indeedio
i tried.. idk what up is
ah i see
also, RainBroDash, mfw most at my school are technophobes. mfw two other guys who knewa bout that are total bros. mfw while teacher went out we turned EVERY SCREEN in a 30comps computer room, either left, right, or upsidedown. Teacher'sfacewhen.
So, now use your Holmes skills to work it out RainBro!
XD
What's going on?
Doesn't matter WhatPayne.
10I'm gonna go on a hunch
You have been deemed guilty.

nah, Dermathil, still ain't read any
It wasn't me who posted it. I just linked it because I thought you'd like to know some anonymous pussy was talking shit behind your back
10Dari love it
Daz, its not working :(
Rodman: aww man. y u no good browser addons
uh
Flutteryay, I didn't include your name because I'm pretty sure you weren't even in the room when RainBro said it.

this work Rodman ?
eeyup
/me is like a deer caught in the headlights
10and flutteryay I'll take your word on that ;) Also: I don't think I would refer to said person as an anonymous pussy, more just that they evidently don't understand what I said in the way I intended it ;)
All right.
10pretty lulzy though
They did kind of take it out of context
[14:30] <RainBroDash> I can't explain it, but it's just the whole imageboard mentality and the type of crowd imageboards attract
[14:30] <RainBroDash> it's not my scene
10I don't really care to be honest, context or not it was accurate to a point
stereotypicalising image board users ;___; when there can be such diverse groups in a thread
I hate imageboards.
'nuff said.
/me still wonders what's going on
10That's why I had to post personally, to make sure people knew why I said it
:P
10whatpayne nothing really, just a teency bit of drama
10I'm surprised he didn't try and start a flame war
Ohh, ok. That explains it.
DRAMATIC IRONY
(that's one of the top 'memes' at my school oh man i'm laughing aloud now haha)
10Flame wars are great for making people in a position like mine look bad :P You kinda get backed into a corner between defending your name and keeping the thread on topic

hey ppls
hihi kitten
Hey :)
good morning
Ffffuuu
haha
i'm not gonna be back till tonight, hopefully I get ta see some I.T. crowd, and House. bai bai ll
all *
:)
morning
how r u?
I'm alright
I still have your snacks in my car btw xD
How's you?
lololol bout the snacks. anything chocolate?
i am good
nervous
Why nervous?
cookie said he has a surprize 4 me and it might be pocket size and it might be mine if i want it....
/me waves
i'm getting butterflies just thinkin bout it.
/me thinks
i mean theres a number of things tht cud fit tht decription, but theres 1 tht its makes me nervous to think about at all.
/me listens
i mean eeeeeeeeep
/me listens more
i'm just.... eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep
Which one makes you nervous?
A Nintendo DS?
Luna!
07good-day everyone
Hai
07how are you?
hey guys
Hey NewDCD
Doing alright, despite the lack of sleep
07want me to sing you a lullaby?
07bla?
:( I would but not at work
9guys I made a proposition thread for an /rp/ concept
9check it out
9http://www.ponychan.net/chan/chat/res/36848474.html
no but what if it is a.... i mean sure i've known him for 3 yrs, sure i can see it, but we havent knocked out all the kinks yet... like issues with the parental figures...
eeep
Parents are surprises that might be pocket sized?
Hey NewDCD, remember you were trying to stress test the stream?
lol no ari.
9yeah
9it's more urgent for us to try to stress test the IRC though
Ah, then that might be out of my reach for now. Opening a few dozen tabs is easy to accomplish, but logging on to Irc might be more time consuming
07check http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pony/res/35777862.html#i35777862
The good news is, Irc takes much less bandwidth than the Stream so I won't need a 100 mbit Metro E
9AWESOME.
07I know right
Good afternoon fellow Bronies.
>checks time >it's before noon
good mroing mother in ar
Well it's after noon here.
:P
07Good-afernoon my name is luna
Well Dari, you've pretty much been around since last night(for me)

I gave Sathi the script, not sure if the pastebin is stil around.

2,14 hello violetvanilla

9.............
9wait a second
RainBroDash, I think we should duet. I'll link myself to yours and I'll play bass or Piano and you play guitar~ :DD
9>ValtheJean
/me pokes Ari... poke!

9I'm making a Mount Frame called the XMTF-24601 Valjean
9and the MC pilots it
2,14 haha, nice

9I'm reading for the novel because of med school, myself
9awesome book

9a bit too long for my deadline though ;___; wish I could read it at my pace
2,14 sorry to hear that :(
heh, Jean Valjean...
a very nice fella
07Lol made by Val <3
Les Miserables is a wonderful book and show
yeah
2,14 it's a shame the movie was not nearly the same quality
I had basically caught on the Jean Valjean part a few weeks back with the him being french thingy
BLA
I figured it out but didn't say anything .-.
luna
can has your script?
*commence obligatory "YOU DID NOT"*
my script?
2,14 Well you should speak more! I'm very happy when people don't assume I'm a pair of jeans!
I just killed it with fire
fixing it now
Trololo.
eh
I just had a nerdgasm, again
/me mews innocently

D: DCD wryyyy?
10so much ponychan srs bzns
/me 2,14 uses ctrl+k like a baws
I don't keep track of the mods on Ponychan. I'm guessing there's some kind of drama going on?
ohey RainBroDash

06xD

I want a Rainbow Dash cake.
Oh god I hate my life lul
@pony Best birthday cake theme
6 Best birthday cake theme is 14Silver S15poon
...
I need to practice my cake baking :(
Just spent the last 10 minutes working on permissions ,forgot that if I rename the folder it breaks... everything forEVER
ouch, AllisZero
Yeah, little oversight on my part. No matter, I can do it again
what kind of box?
File server
Unix based?
Nah, Windows 2008 R2
Ah okay... I feel for you. :P
It's not that bad!
I honestly didn't want to overhaul everything, just make things more manageable and faster
lol I'm kinda kidding, I haven't really used Windows in 10 years
I know, I know
I do want to get into Linux, but oh the procrastination
Eh, I hear Windows is pretty good nowadays
WINDOWS
is okay
but honestly
i would choose Mac over anything else
once
I made it my two week misson
to put Mac OS X on a PC
There's a pony for everything on Mac!
and it was fucking hard as hell
yes
there is
Really, if you do comparisons and the such, Linux is like. . . Windows XP capatibility wise with programs, but just Windows 7 in speed and workability.
Flutterwhat.
windows is the BEST at gaming man
Hoof, now.
hoof
?
I giggle whenever somepony tells me that they bought a mac
/me brohoofs Flutterwhat
YES okay :D
I can tell you with certainty, from working with Windows 7 since it came out, that it's much more stable than XP
I used to use Windows Vista Beta 1 back in the day
Also much easier to actually get shit working
i LOVED aero's design
Because Mac OSX on dual boot on my W7 is. . .
i like Vista's task bar design better the windows 7's however.
les easy~
Vista was bad and they should feel bad
Linux is a lot more convenient for some developers, like me. It really depends on what you're doing, though. I'm not knocking any OS.
my current iMac was the best of it's line in 2006
my next iMac will be a beast
@RobotPinkie: Exactly, my point was trying to compare Linux to another OS for relativity's sake.
My assistant is a macfag
with 500gbs each for Windows 7 and Mac OS X
But he's not a brainless fanboy like some of the others
OH MY WORD
WINDOWS TOOK TEN SECONDS TO LOG IN
I'm kind of a fag for Open Source. :P
IF I BOUGHT A MAC IT WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THIS
OH MY WORD
YES
IT WOULD
THIS WINDOWS MINIMIZED INSTEAD OF DISAPPEARED
BECAUSE MAC HARDWARE IS THE BEST HARDWARE
MY MAC WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THIS
and it would be even faster if you had a SSD installed
and YES IT WOULD
lol yelling
Haha
It's because they usually speak in yells
im passionate about boot times. apparently.
@Flutterwhat: I'm using real qorld examples of Macfags
<3
Ubuntu boots in 10 seconds flat, for me.
My Windows 7 boots in 6.7 seconds
And that's with Derpy as my boot logo
;D
If everyone could refresh their page.
Mac os X will always be 20% cooler
On bronystate.
Mandriva took almost a minute... what a derp distro
With the F5 button.
k lol
k, dari
LISTEN TO DARI
F5
Alright
No no no no no
We be testin' stuffs.
You got it wrong. ..
2,14 is it just bronystate.co, or will dinkypage work too?
Both.
wai?
ALT + F4 is refresh I believe <3
kk
I edited both.
Ah, lemme check .co.cc
2,14 kk
oh hai jayne
Nothing changed so far
Except everyone got kicked from the chat?
By the way if you just click the nav bar on .co.cc that doesn't count as a refersh.
refresh*
I don't really see a difference?
You have to be on the theatre page and press F5.
Ok.
Well you'll see.
It'd help if I knew what had changed.
Oh stuff changed.
The irc has changed.
/me refreshes again
Yeah I can see
bronyserv.co.cc now huh
2,14 that means I should probably stop using mIRC then, huh? :P
IRC has changed?
Testing, yeah.
neat!
Want me to prepare the Orbital friendship cannon?
Well that address is irc.bronyserv.co.cc
the*
Just go file -> new

So what is being tested now Dari?
testing
Yeah, no one has registered nicks right now.
So.
oh so this is the new one?
Just bandwidth use.
Twenty peeps
so the other channel should be abandoned?
I think we need more
Hmm
Not 100% what we're doing yet though.
Ah okay.
We may be switching here if it can take the strain.
Or just a different bigger IRC server.
That doesn't cap our room limit like epic-chat seems to be doing.
I can prepare the orbital friendship cannon.
Yeah, gunna use it for movie night.
IRC isn't all that traffic intensive.
See what happens.
It is when you have 4000+ people.
:>
Yeah I don't think I can simulate 4000 tabs
XD
Well, that's true, but how do we test that? :P
I can but that would involve a few hours of work that I don't think I can put forth :(
We're using this server for movie night.
hope it goes well :P
Then I'll estimate from my bandwidth usage during that time how many people this server can take.
we gonna register nicks and stuff?
Yeah.
I could write a script to open 4000 tabs, maybe... assuming the IRC client supports it.
is it all set up already now?
Services are up, yes.
and mib_o7u8re mibbit only lets you have 4 I think
We have memoserv, hostserv, botsev.
I wrote a script to flood IRC ;D
So we need 1000 people to test it in mibbit? :P
Hmm
That's weird.

Lulz
So I can only have one connection open?
It doesn't like mibbit.
ARE YOU READY FOR SOME DARK KNIGHT?!?!
Give me a minute.
There we go.
Hard to test, in that case. :(
Only dislike about campus wi-fi is having to log in every time I start my computer
And since campus password reset policy is every 60 days, there's no point in auto login
Dark Knight? yesplz
Each user can only have 5 instances of their hostname.
>mfw checking infos about David Tennant I realize he's 40 years old
That would make stress testing impossible
That was only my seconds connection, though.

I don't want to die :(
it lets me have 4 mibbit clones on at once
Thehen don't make fun ova meeeheeeheeeee~
Weird... it only lets me have one, it seems.
I'M PATHEEHEEEHEEHEHEEEETIIIIICCCCC
10the 4th one is still in the other server
/me hugs VioletVanilla
6I have figured since my name is Violet I should have Violet text.
Hmm, wonder what I'm doing wrong...
Weird.
0Nevermind. XD
Services issue.
/me kills services.
/me is reading about how so many people of the Doctor Who production team/cast are ascended fanboys/fangirls
doesn't surprise me, considering how long that show has lasted
yap :P
What's really sad is that Douglas Adams is dead, I would've loved to see him write for the new Doctor Who. :(
well all the actors for the doctor of the new series were born after the show began
Well he's listed on the tvtropes page RP
also, David Tennant is probably the biggest example of it.
At what time does S2EP1 air on the 17th?
He wrote during the Tom Baker years.
UKBrony, Saturday Morning cartoon
so... hmmm.
/me starts to calculate what time it would result in the UK
i need the specifics :D
How early in the morning?
i'm omw to beating festers quest.. with save states.. keeping in tradition with the nes i will have to beat it without them later though.. so many chances to die.. none that i'm willing to take
GMT is EST+5
eeyup
I think it is supposed to be at around 9 AM EST
Hmm
so... 2PM?
Yeah. No official word on exact time?
0http://www.eeyup.com/
0<3
this is quite fun:D
Hahaha that's funny
savestating is the way to play Fester's Quest, really
I don't think there is, RP.
Well, then we'll just have to wait and see, I guess.
>mfw I notice RBD and Valthejean don't look like mods no more
liez
where's your half-star then?
Till after BMN at least.
it's hidden
aaaaah
ah okay, so we should abandon the old one until then?
Well anyone joining from now on will be in here.
0It's so empty. . . Are the other users unaware? o:
Most of the users in the other channel are AFK.
Dinkypage still seems to be on the other IRC
It's not.
Should do a +m and just leave a message
For anyone who comes back from ay eff kay
I think that's a good plan
You know which games do require alot of savestating?
The Gheb FE hacks
Holy crap, are they hard
There are still people talking in there :P
Should just akick with refresh the page - new server
Well, akick is something different.
But meh.
I'll call it akick anyway.
Whatever you think is right :P
akick and not aboot?
06hmm
He's from the UK, not Canada :P
06i am /bored
but yeah, plz fix that soon, so people come over here
Meh.

I'm still in this room, weird...
yeah
So am I
so special
I cleared the cache and everything, too.
I'm not. . . x.x

yet I see you others in the chattext
0Forever alone~
Gah.
yeah
this is derptastic
0I'm kind of scared too, because I know that a couple of people PMing me are now like . . .
0In the Twilight Zone
0XD
2,14 so are we still using this channel?
Hey what's rebooting?
0Funny story commence. The Twilight Zone is an actual place on the internet, it's not a dimension of sight, nor sound, but more rather a place of absolute mystery. When a game desyncs, but continues going and the ghost of the other user is still playing. When a video buffers endlessly but is somehow playing in another window.
0You've stepped across the line, and have entered. . .
Changing irc? What's going on?
0The Twilight Zone.
The Derpy Zone would be much stranger, I feel.
(:
0;D
0Right you are!
Though I once kept playing WoW for minutes before the game noticed I was disconnected....
0This is what I speak of. . .
0>D
It was very creepy. Everything was frozen in place, and I just ran around and looked at stuff that I wasn't supposed to be able to get near.
0It is very odd sometimes. . .
0By the way, I see that it's just you and I. . .
0o:
Really? :O
0And Dari is fixing all of the leaks in the system
...how do I get back to the real world?
0and I THINK Dermathil might have been ponynapped. . .
0I don't know. . .
STILL HERE, trying to fix my flipping problem
let me clear cache and restart the browser...

That was your problem? o:

What's up? o:
Are we changing rooms or something?
2,14we're trying to sort this all out at the moment, we'll let you know when there's something to report

Eeyup.
Mwuahahahaha
So I was playing Winter Wrap Up on guitar earlier and my brother recognized it.
Oh cool, I think I'm finally back
So, that means I have infected him with a dangerous war worm
Nice job, Flutteryay
*ear worem

I can't type, even though I am very good at spelling...
I was humming "Proud to be a Brony" all day at work.

/me decides to leave for class.
Cyall!
(still 1 hours before it begins but I got stuff to verify)
I can type and spell fairly well, but I need to work on my grammar.
Sometimes some weird Swedish grammar sneaks in. I am very disappoint :(
...I think my grammar just killed the entire chat.
07Pinkie!
07*hugs*
/me hugs Luna
07yay
Yay, hi Luna!
07how are you?
07looking forward to 4 eps of house?
I didnt know grammar could kill a chatroom.
2,14 I would be looking forward to house...if I didn't have classes during them :(
I finally completely outed myself as a brony to everyone I know.
2,14 how'd it go?
and yes, I am very much looking forward to that, especially since I fell asleep during the 3rd episode last night
07today we wrap season 2 up :)
/me 2,14 cries
lol well so far no one's called me any names, at least
07poor val
Season wrap u[p, Season wrap up~~~
07i'll save the episodes for you
2,14 lol grats pinkie, you're a step above me ;)
2,14 Sathi, all my <3
2,14 all of it
Hi guys! Whats goin on?
I doubt everyone's seen it thus far, but we'll see in... about 5 hours?
07Season wrap-up, Season wrap-up
2,14 let's finish our medical cheer
07House + IT crowd today and maybe 1 ep of a random cartoon
'cause tomorrow Lupus is heeeeere
seriously?
Oh it's "for"
hey madponyking
why do we only watch IT crowd and house?
07cause House is awesome
because... they're awesome shows. :P
Oh. I see
they are indeed.
pretty sure there's some wiggle room in what else Luna streams, though
But whys should we stick with only them?
07people like House
07I like House
07= win
damn straight!
07People like IT crowd
I'd vote for some more Freakazoid, too :3
07I like IT crowd = double win
2,14 You can't argue with that logic :P
so when do we watch it?
Once all the IT crowd has been gone through, we could maybe continue with Spaced, like I suggested yesterday?
07No Spaced available.. I looked for it today
about an hour from now, I think. Luna would know better than me, though.
07any other suggestions?
how about Heroes?
07I was thinking about Bones, NCIS or CSI
Damn. It's available through the "other" method.
2,14 G3! *Trollface*
07lol
NO!
G3.5 :3
2,14 RobotPinkie: Win
why not just G4?
trolololo
Well the voice of pinkie pie is in the G3.5 somewhere
No G4 eps outside BMN... until S2, anyway
0And then there were two. . .
awww...
It's gunna take a while.
sometimes people set up synchtube rooms though, not sure if that's frowned upon or something
2,14 LICD has become so much better now that larz admitted to being a brony :P
LICD?
2,14 Least I Could Do
Anywho, there is that other British show I have not seen, Black Books.
2,14 wubs Bwack Boks! /)^3^(\
oh okay
Do the things we watch have a schedule or something so that I dont miss anything?
shit man. fucking time zones, how do they work?
07I normally start my streaming around 3:30 PM Eastern
0714 mins CaJ
in other words, 2 hours?
0Understood <3 Thank you for doing all that you do for BronyState! You don't get enough recognition or thanks~
07yes
oh that cod.
>that
Haha, thank you. :)
Oh
oh thank cod*
I've been listening to brony music all day. So. Awesome.
But hey, got my Luna t-shirt done. Now I can proudly display my Bronydom in open.
yay
I was literally laying in bed last night going to sleep, had my alarm set for 1:00 my time. Then I was like 'wait... doesn't BMN start at 7, but I always get there at 6? OHSHITOHSHITOHSHIT"
Four months of speculation, and awesome fan works too. We've kept our fandom busy with the Brony things we do. But out patience has been running out and we can't grow in this cold. And even though I love season 1, the wait is getting old...
Nice, WhatPayne!
I want to see this shirt WhatPayne :3
one sec
Me too, or at least the image it's based on :3
http://img202.imageshack.us/img202/9545/img1265h.jpg
that's one of the better Winter Wrap Up Parodies I've heard
because seriously they all suck
Hope the link works
Thanks! I made that myself.
DAT SHIRT
Oooooh, nice
Made the design myself influenced by MegaSweets wallpapers
<3
It's beautiful~
Why thank you.
What'd you use on the shirt to get it that way?
0No problem! ^.^
Um It was inkjetprinter iron on transfer paper for black fabric
it's really great
07So guys
?
07NCIS / CSI / Bones or something else?
I like CSI...
Which CSI?
CSI: MIAMI
CSI Miami if we want a lulzy chat room :P
I'd go with Miami too.
regular CSI is much better, but not nearly as funny, so I'd vote Miami too
/me is checking
miami sounds good to me...
But this is only after we run out of IT crowd right?
This is such an awesome song... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0sW8KrZF5s

07Bah no Miami available and only 2 eps of the original
Aw. CSY: New York then?
CSI, lol
07trying the "other"way
Crime Scene Yngwiemalmsteengations
Why csi? why not Law & Order?
it looks like Miami...
07Alright guys back in a bit

ah got nothin
I wouldn't mind Law & Order, either, really...
Do whichever you need Luna~

yeah, whatever your heart's all up ins

HAHA
Oh wow, that is special right there
And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
the song sounds horrible the first time you watch it.... But it grows on ya...
JUST TO GET IT ALL OFF WHAT'S IN MY HEAD
AND II II II III~
Well the actual song it's based on is awesome
I MEET UP WITH YOUUUU~
4 Non Blondes
lol
My parents have their 8-track tape.
:3
Yay VioletVanilla!
07How did you hear about us?
MYAAAH!
that would be on a ponychan thread
07When?
it was for the first one actually
Space Jam and Mulan
07How many movienights have you attended so far?
lolol that's an awesome video right there
cod, I don't think I'd know without a list or something... it's been a bunch though
HEY! I just had an awesome idea!
Why dont we watch Adventure Time?!
whats that?
I
07Take a wild guess?
A tv show suposedly for kids like my little pony.
I would estimate at least like... ten? maybe
That is an idea I can get behind
Its epicly awesome!
07Alright
Adventure Time is awesome
lol
07What role did you apply for?
I have all episodes.
If I could stream I would.
yeah give it a go
but don't tell Dari
He hates it c.c
moderator
>_>
seriously?
Because it sucks.
07Do you have any experience with moderating?
awww man
D:
DON'T KILL ME DARI
SPARE ME
It's actually pretty creepy to be honest. :P
Or at least my kitten. . .
Nah, I just kill RainBro.
OOH KITTENS
Haha, oh okay
TASTY!
yes sir, I modded a video game stream for TomBobBlender on uStream
Omnomnomnomnom
Creepy?
NOOOO!
Well I guess that idea's shot down then. :P
07How many viewers did the show have?
awww...
07I'll ignore the yes sir part for now....
what should i do with my time then?
I streamed a couple episodes by request one time.
and what happened?
Half the people found it weird / creepy like me and half liked it.
hmm... let me think
lol not even MLP FIM is loved by all!
Is it made for TV or internet spawn thing-y?
07Sure
For tv
It originated in the US on TV. . .
oh ok
Well, FiM is loved by everyone here, though :P
Sure is!
You don't even know . . .
FiM is EVERYTHING here
/me is in Germany
@awesomemeter Friendship is Magic
6 Friendship is Magic is 70% awesome. (1554)
See? That's just heresy.
IIRC it was anywhere between 50-200 viewers...? a pretty rough estimate, but it should be pretty accurate
In Finland FIM isn't that big yet...
depending on the game, I guess
Oooh, nice.
06thats becasue in finland, magic is friendship
She just wants a bit of the flank. . . <3
Hai Luna
What?
07What is your availability for moderating?
lol it's not that big in Sweden, I meant in this chat everyone loves it
what?
Of course eveyone here loves it.
What?
what?
Speaking of loving MLP... Check out equestria´s national anthem (lol jk): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSIE155ePqI&feature=autoplay&list=FLmANqFFCiTCLrlhgnhKlZng&lf=BFa&playnext=10

I have no job or school currently, so I have a lot of availability
It's me, RobotPinkie...
Hi Decap!
inb4 "Who?"
pretty much any weekday after 1, most weekends
where?
06oi RobotPinkie
but I'm almost never busy on friday and saturday
sorry everyone, forgot I got disco'd from this chatroom when the IRC switching happened
hay Wrek
VioletVanilla, you are one of the lucky ones or I am unlucky one
06ik now atleast 12 swedish bronies atm
maybe one or the other though
In real life, Wrek?
06aye
Of course I realize I just said "several" and you're talking about all of Finland
idk where Sweden even is lol
Wow, that's quite a lot, Wrek
no wait
06yeah
i remember
06convod 3 of em myself
its next to norway right?
I know like... one potential brony, possibly two
06the otehr 2 the otehrs
I know, but also I know no other Bronies Irl myself
anyway what are you talking about?
Swede is below Norway, next to Finland
Sweden*
Converting your friends to bronydom is always a fun activity...
07What can you do that would set you apart from other applicants?
Sweden is to the right of Norway :P
06not below
07In other words what would you contribute to the team if we would hire you?
well in france nobody knows about it
07As in ideas, thoughts, plans; try to think outside of the box. But don't forget to showcase your abilities
07np
OMG
I beg to differ RP
WHERE IS THE STREAM?!?!?!??!?!?!?!
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Finland-CIA_WFB_Map.png/276px-Finland-CIA_WFB_Map.png
I'd say its more popular in France tho.
07starting in 90 mind
07mins*
well i dont really know
well i knew that sweden was next to Russia
It's popular in France, Germany, and UK
Huh, VioletVanilla? That's a very tiny part of Norway that's above Sweden...
cause i know alot about the motherland
just a fact that they cant speak english for shit here
The stream is IN Russia
... shit, man
<- from Russia
My knowlege of FIM's popularity depends on EqD news.
Well yes, you're right RP
07We like to get to know you a bit better
it kind of spoons Sweden
so they wouldnt know about mlp unless it is in french
<3
I know I shouldn't...but that made me Lol
06<3
like... skills as a mod or just... skills
INCOMING HETALIA
07:P
07the shit, man thing?
Become one with Russia.
07Skills in general we can zoom in on your mod skills later
Lolwut
yeah
Doesn't everyone in internet almost have to be able to speak english?
That doesn't seem the best thing to say in an interview.
^ Yes
its taught in most school systems in the world
and no
weel
*well
well, I like to think I'm okay at video games, I can usually beat casuals, but the more hardcore will usually stomp me flat
a good amount
Russia always gets their asses kicked by the Finns :P
07dat answer
You dont HAVE to. But it helps
DK I wasn't saying no to your reply XD
06dat answer indeed
...
Wut
i know
A-whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?
Oh okay
Let's put it this way. . .
06sho dari, you have a config to mkae :P
If you're on the internet
XD
and you're talking to someone
07Any other skills you have?
Type english unless otherwise noted
Learned that the first time. . .
most people i know in france just have an inability to learn english
06^
/me begins rambling in German.
it isnt really needed, you can just translate most things
Exactly, I had no idea Violet you were (I suppose) Finnish until now.
but I am frequently singing along to things I listen to, sometimes to the dismay of others
Violet is Finnish?
I'm Deutsch WP XD;
07If we would ask a friend of yours to describe you, what would he / she say?
Wait, what?
so your German?
I have friends in Finland
and family that moved there
but I was born in Austria
/me begins rambling in swedish, SKÅL!
do you live in Berlin?
Oh ok.
who here is actualy from the USA? just out of curiosity...
depends on who you ask... the first guy who comes to mind would probably call me an asshole -.-
I sorta thought only Finnish would have several Finnish friends.
and then moved here to Dresden, Saxony, Germany
07dat answer
Waarom moet ik Engels spreken? :(
I think that's going to be the slogan of this interview :P
im from Russia, but i dont know any Russian
but i live in the US
Wow.
"dat answer"
07How so?
So thats a "No one" ?
I visited Berlin last year. That city is awesome!
/me just found CSI miama S1
I guess only Luna would get that, lolz
07Miami*
Y U NO STREAM ARCHER?
mostly because I like to be sarcastic, I guess
Because my parents thought it'd be beneficial if I ever go anywhere outside of Europe
06So far i feel hesitant
Or IN Europe even .~.
07If you needed to describe yourself in 3 words what would they be?
go to RUssia
gaming internet lurker
Violet ever been in Finland yourself?
07oh lol...
06:|
shall I make a "dat answer" meme now? :P
I work as a secretary and during my interview English was one of the key reasons I got the job.
07sure
07What specific ideas do you have to improve Brony Movie Night and help increase viewership?
Luna doesn't approve of my dutch... probably because I'm 10 years out of practise. :(
06where was dat answer, when the interview took place?
win wrek, just win :P
One of the main functions I do is translate from German to English and English to German
06thanks, i do my best ^^
dose it pay well?
Wrek?
maybe asking the guys who run those Facebook Bronies pages to advertise or something
07Any other ideas?
they have two pages with like 5,000 and 8,000 likes
That's a bit personal...
not unless you haven't been on EqD already
English translators get really bad pay here, because so many people speak it well.
Hai Dari, WHERE IS THE STREAM?!??!?!?!?!
07Well, she doesn't have to answer
07it's her personal choice
maybe an advert in celestia radio
yep
im just curious
I'm setting shit up DecapKing. :P
In a word, yes.
as for improvements, I think it's pretty good already... not sure if I could make it any better
Luna: Yeah, but it's just one of those things you don't ask, like a woman's age. :P
Well, here it is anyway.
Germans aren't usually very good at English, no offence :P
Though I live in the civil land of Britainland.
:P
2,14 but we can ask your age though Dari :P
Or weight
Dari where you busy looting?
07Why do you want to be a BMN moderator?
oh shit! I gotta go! Bye guys! Have a nice stream!
inb4 dat answer :P
bai madponyking
cya
07those answers
Oh I agree RobotPinkie
Nevermind, was just trying to get your attention for the file.
basically
I think it's that in Germany everything gets dubbed, doesn't it?
well, the reasons are layered, but when it really comes down to it, you guys have exposed me to movies I would have never seen before, and you're also pretty awesome people, so I wanna help in any way I can
07I just hate the german movie syncing.. or tv shows
07so much fail...
In Sweden only children's shows/movies get dubbed.
06ok the file's in the folder
^Same in Finland
07Any other motivations?
What, because nearly all the adults speak English?
Meine Mutter ist Englisch-Lehrerin
and same in Norway, btw.
Oshit Conan's on TV
06the majority is very fluetn in english, for sweden that is
;A;
^Same
07Dari are you streaming tonight?
Depends on how much stuff I have to do.
not even a real reason, just a perk, I guess
I usually stream whenever you finish.
And somtimes before you start.
sometimes*
Except Finns can't pronounce properly anything
06*dat asnwer*
07Ah ok I was planning to go live in 90 mins
In English that is
2,14 well, colors are pretty sexy ;)
They can pronounce Swedish pretty well, WhatPayne, at least in Helsinki :P
07Do you have any previous IRC experience?
Sprinkles was so desperate for his colour. XD
oh lol, fraction of a second too late of me.
lol
Ahh, the good old days.
yeah, the other chat I modded was on ustream, which uses IRC
Of earlier this year.
XD
Man, Helsinki is such a nice city. I can't wait to go back sometime.
Really? I kinda had the idea our Swedish is like unintelligible to Swedish.
I didn't use the commands that often as a mod though, because I usually just right clicked
Not really, WhatPayne, I could talk to every single Finn I met in Helsinki
07At least he's honest
You live there?
That's nice. Goes to show how you souldn't belive everything people say.
Yes, I live in Helsinki.
07That concludes the first part of the interview, we're gonna move on to the second part of the interview now.
07I'm going to show you some images and I want you to tell me how you would respond as a mod if they were posted in the chat.
:V
07Tell me when your ready
I'm sorry to say my Swedish is so bad I would not attempt to speak it to anyone.
Cool, me and my girlfriend love the city. We might go back next year.
06agreed
As the great pony #7 once said
That's nice, Hope you have good time.
LET's DO THIS
Hello Bronystate
Hellew
oh cod that was stupid
06actualyl going there by shuttle in a month or so to visit a fellow brony
If you're still around #BronyState then I could buy you a beer, WhatPayne :P

hey Apokalipse
That would be nice, and I probably will.
it is cupcake related, but nothing too explicit, so probably a warning
It's awesome meeting other bronies... I hear, anyway. :P
FYI ever see another person going with "WhatPayne" then it's most likely me.
I'm not sure if I replied to you WhatPayne, but yes I have been to visit there several times.
07Second image:
Last time I visited I wrote an anthem on the piano for my friend.
06mfw i dont know what cupcakes is
Yes I read that. That's really nice. It's just I'm finnish and we don't get that kinds of compliments that often.
you don't want to
I go by RobotPika/RobotPinkie everywhere online now.
also http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r118/ValtheJean/DatAnswer.jpg
that would probably warrant a kick
06nice val
ty :P
06and thank you for getting me to want to know
06sily yo
lol
07:D
I could go into detail if you wanted, but you really are better off not knowing
07Third image:

That makes it easier to go around, but only if the name is such that no-one else might not use.
except Google+ and Facebook, for obvious reasons :P
2,14 ohai octavia
Hi Škoda
06val
06now.
lol, I'll pm it to you
Yeah, WhatPayne, I just figured the pika was an obscure enough animal that not many people would connect it with robots :P
not as bad as the second one I guess, because they're not literally on top of each other, but still at the very least, a warning
14Hey guys
Hai Octavia
I'm in love with Pika, but you've probably never herd of it
I saw two Škoda Octavias today
probably a kick though because actual kissing is involved
:p
Hi Octavia~ :3
I've been using my nick for about an decade now. It's like my other name.
ohay Octavia!
07>mfw a kick for the 3rd picture
06agreed
06a first isnt it?
Oh hi Octavia.
Hi Tavi

Fine then, Hai Octi
07Fourth image is down
07One sec
DEM OCTAVES

Nice
Been using mine for maybe 3-4 years, not sure. Before that I went by different permutations of robot/mechanical and wolf, but that proved... uh... to be too popular. :P
if you wanted, I could upload all four images to my photobucket, that way the links will stay forever
07please do

07but we need a new nr 4

I never drank Dr. Pepper
07Octa you should see his interview in a bit on the forums :)
found it
It's my favorite soft drink.
07We created a new meme around it
Or at least not an shop around here
damn
I've drank many soft drinks before, and am like only one I know who likes it. :/
the image is kinda tiny
but for now it works
07I need a big one

Unfortunately I don't live in the US so I can't really indulge in it as much :P
Dr. Pepper I mean
07keep looking
kk, I'll keep looking
14Whatre we looking for exactly atm?
whew
never thought I'd see the day where I'd actually try to upload this image
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/dis/src/131154337367.png
What is it like?
07http://www.ponychan.net/chan/dis/src/131154337367.png
that link works for everyone, right?
06yeah
It's like cola for adults I think
14Ywah
kk
07yes
14*yeah
oh god why
07dat response
adults drink cola too.
The only cola I drink regularly is Coca-Cola
oh oh wait
I have the meme!
http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r118/ValtheJean/DatAnswer.jpg
14lol
I like Mezzo Mix as well.
yeah that's a definite boot to the head
It's kinda like Jolt and some cherry soft drink had a baby..... maybe.
06"boot to the ehad"
06nice
It's hard to describe tastes, I think. :P
Mezzo Mix is awesome
14Naaa naaa
I discovered Mezzo when I visited Berlin
07Alright, that was the last part of the interview.
Funny, I've just been to Berlin a couple of days ago
But I knew of Mezzo Mix before
07Do you have anything to add?
14"The best defense is a god offense. You know who said that? Mel, the cook on Alice. lol
Mezzo is delicious <3
Interestingly we had not had Mezzo when I visited Berlin (That was early last year) and we did not get that drink here.
/me hits "Replay" for the 10th time on "Are You Proud to be a Brony?"
nothing that I think would help me in any way :I
14Got up early and everything and still missed pretty much the entire interview. :P
But soon after that visit the stores around started to import it.
There's an awesome soft drink here (Slovenia) that is my favorite though
Does anypony that comes to Deutschland visit anywhere OTHER than Berlin? XD
Such a shame I can never discuss it because nobody knows how it tastes
I've never had Mezzo Mix... no idea what it is.
07We will discuss your interview with the rest of the team.
07Please join our next regular BMN show as we will post further recruitment updates there.
Yes, I've been to Munich several times
What it's called.
lol, what an interview it was :P
Okay. Good.
alright
Cockta... Now before you jump to conclusions the name is derived from Cocktail
:D
thanks for the consideration
14I always miss the best moments. lol
I've been to Germany, but not Berlin, VioletVanilla, so I guess me :P
I've been thinking of visiting the alps.
ME TOO
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Cockta.jpg/250px-Cockta.jpg
That's it
We shall visit the Swiss Alps together. <3
I go to Austria many times for skiing. It's great
You and who, VioletVanilla?
I guess he meant me?
lol oh, WhatPayne
I jelly, I've never been there
^.^; She actually WhatPayne
XD
lol
Sorry *she
:3 I am a proud Pegasis~
14So which was he again? I dont remember seeing that name in the recruitment forum.
07soo hmm.. how do I save the chat log at once? Looks like ctrl + A doesn't work
And one of the only in this Bratwürstefest~
I thought it was just all "bronies"
We don't have he/she distinction in finnish language.
07in mIRC that is
14Copy/paste?
That's my excuse.
07yea ;)
14Oooh.
I've joined the herd that says there's bronies and pegasis
;3 is fine WhatPayne~
I like having the term pegasis just because I appreciate a god pun
>god pun
14Not sure bout mIRC. If it wont let you simply copy it.
Dont hate me ;_;
14Print screen? and crop? Lmao
sehr gut meine freunde ;D
Alright: I posted on the interviews thread with updated links for all the images
since they're tied to my photobucket, they shouldn't be going away any day soon
sie wurden vergeben, WhatPayne!
<3
danke schön
oh oh sathi
bitte sehr
you're going to love me
go into tools
then log files
Suddenly, silence. . .
it'll have the entire log saved for you
Wiederbelebungsgetränke, or something of that sort
I feel scared T~T
Please stop confusing my mind. It has but one year of German leaning experience. And not very good experience at that
:P
14Oh, it keeps logs like IM clients, nifty.
:P
learning*
Energy drinks, RobotPinkie? XD
14Didnt think about that, but I've never looked back at old convos on mIRC either.
It's an item from a game in German we had on C64 when I was a little kid, VioletVanilla :P
Or verbatim "Resuscitation drinks"
I'm pretty sure that it keeps you from dying when you hit 0 hearts
07Bah :(
:3
do you want me to save it out as a text file for you?
yep :P
14Oh, thats why. He goes by "CAJ"
07it looks a bit messy now on the forums
07take a peek
14Ehh, its not so bad.
I do understand most German, though... what with knowing a lot of Dutch
14Little messed.
07yer a little
the important thing is we can read what he wrote
14:P
Yeah~
Dutch is really weird language.
I don't :p
14Think its retarded mIRC wont just let you copy/paste it.
07WAT?!
07Weird?
I wub Dutch, lol
I'm a bit Hungary, don't Dutch my Komputer while I'm Norway~
lol, don't tell that to dari :P
Especially when women speak Dutch, I think it sounds very nice and soft :3
14Ugh, he was the attention horse too.
07I agree
Sorry, but I tried to learn some words when I visited Netherlands, and I could not.
07Welcome Violet
Thank you, greetings to you all.
I'll probably only be able to stick around for the first part of this interview
How do you say beer in dutch?
as I've got an evening class in about an hour >.,
>.<*
14Yay VV
köstlich~ <3
I mean, how do you say it Robotpinkie? :3
14Greetings
07Violet, I'm just going to ask you a series of questions for the first part of the interview and I want you to answer them to the best of your ability.
Bier
Not 100% on the spelling...
07Do you have any questions before we start?
I haven't been to the Netherlands in maybe 5-6 years
07correct Robot
Oh, like German then
No, I understand.
Netherlands was nicest country in whole EU I've been in.
jaja
12 Hello, Suinide and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
07How did you hear about us?
I'm gonna have to break out my Dutch-Swedish dictionary if you have more questions :P
I do still understand almost everything, though.
That means I know how to say beer in 8 languages. I am so multilingual
During my Dutch aunt's birthday there were having a pretty high level discussion in Dutch, and I joined in in English. Fun times.
*they were
I was searching for Brony sites on Google and stumbled upon Brony State as one of the top sites.
14Reading CAJs interviewa a bit right now too... "... shit man" Lmao
07What do you like about Brony State?
lol yeah, that's what sparked the meme :P
Luna where are you from?
Ummm....hi?

The fact that all of the staff are very respectful, the layout of the site is very simple yet easily navigated. Being able to join other fans of My Little Pony in discussions and viewing of the show is encouraging and enjoyable. Many of the members are talkative and inclusive to newcomers.
Haha, oh wow
:P
07Anything else?
I would not question Fluttershy's ability to make warface :/
In my personal opinion, it's one of the best sites community wise, and the selection of content is suitable for most ages.
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/fic/src/131415370620.jpg
14He didnt even know BronyState has been posted on EqD. lol Though I spose not everyone likes EqD
Warface, you say?
...true. The dragon and cockatrice would certainly not question her.
07How many movienights have you attended so far?
I never go to EqD but I knew it was advertised there :P

I have attended five movie nights for European and four US thus far.
Damn that derp spelling
07Tell us a bit about yourself

I'd imagine huge trigger guard capable to fit whole hoof...
>CAJ interview, what he said at the beginning
14He said it right before the images portion. :P
07oh right :P

Bigger question is how would pony without wings carry said weapon while moving,
14Austria, nice nice.
14Me Gusta
haha! I wasn't the only one to be harassed by the text limit each post! :P
I imagine that they could design an appropriate holster
14lol
14I like that she has a lot to say and takes the time to say it all.
Or some sort of carrying sling to hold it ready in place...
baking and learning how to cook. I am currently employed as a secretary at a small office where I work daily.
07me too
but but! What about the "...aw shit, man!" answers? They are so eloquent and beautiful :P
Rarity designs such slings for the Equestrian Armed Forces, I'm pretty sure :P
07her mom is a teacher
Anyone here want to see a possible MLP season 2 spoiler?
I wont post it in mane chat

I do
Not really, no

07Do you have any experience with moderating?
I live by myself out of a small townhaus with my pet dog Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

07how classic
Eugh dogs.
14I like it. :D

I have average experience moderating, my last work of doing so was on a small forum's IRC channel.
Meaning what will happen in first episode as the plot goes? Then no thanks.
Yeah, and ok

What is, AllisZero?
07What can you do that would set you apart from other applicants?
hm, let's try
@awesomemeter
6 You are 69% awesome. (1559)
07In other words what would you contribute to the team if we would hire you?
Oh, nice number there
that's a shame...she's been looking like a really strong candidate to this point
07As in ideas, thoughts, plans; try to think outside of the box. But don't forget to showcase your abilities
Eh, one of my users can't print, update printer drivers, etc. She's on 32-bit, but all other 32-bit clients work because I won't do anything without testing it...
14lol Dari
14What a troll, jeez
What?
14And I agree.
That's... weird
07did you enjoy my trolling last night?

14Well, Sathi is always trolling with that stuff anyway. :P
well I always enjoy it, just because people's reactions to it are priceless :P
Oh yeah Sathi.
It was great. XD
We didn't get to see how the epsiodes ended though. :(
Yet still, the machine simply won't take the updated drivers like everyone else, and it's making me mad.
14My memory is fuzzy, remind me. :P
07SOON!
The seaponies are still frozen under the ice!
/me hits replay on "Pinkie's Lie" for the 10th time today
14Oooh yeah. That. lol
I grew up with 3 older sisters, so I've learned to have an unnatural threshold for tolerating girl's shows :P
As far as my abilities go, as aforementioned, I can stream a wide variety of shows. I'm also able to do musical DJing or Radio Shows. One idea I had was to expand the site to include podcasts or group oriented radio shows that would entertain or draw in members weekly. Many members enjoy livestreams for different personalities and that would be a good opening
14Fuek der sea ponies.
/me wonders where the stream is
Ouch... I hate when stuff like that happens. Makes me glad I don't work with it.
14They could just shoo be doo their ways out!
How would IT Crowd handle that problem?
I like her answer there
hey everyone
07me too
Oh that's right, when's stream, Luna?
hows it going
she and I could organize music related streams :P
I also think that having a slight heavier member focus as far as content goes would be helpful as well.
hay Synros
Have you tried turning it on and off again?
07could you clarify that?
Huh, new You're Gonna Go Far Kid PMV was made
For Twilight/NMM
er....not that House and the Doctor aren't fabulous ;)

14Hey, that was my idea!
Well, that's the Twilight one.
I wasn't around for your interview!
Still sped up audio, lol
14Though I figured since we do movies and shows, that a music stream wouldn't really be our... thing. lol
well might i say, it works
Yeah
Dunno why they all use the sped one
14I didn't mention it in my interview because I didn't think it would get any praise. :P
The sped up one actually fits the RD one, since sped up Offspring's lead singer does sound kinda like Dash.
07a weekly podcast might be cool though
Well it kinda works, but I love the regular song
probally to make the videos shorter or to have the higher pitch
bah! You must be more assertive Octavia!
>had no idea you were thinking similar things
/me is now offended :P
14But I was apart of Everypony radio for a while and used to music streaming more.
14lol
A good example would be to have our members contribute their own projects, art, music, fictions, etc. onto the site. Maybe even combine the two ideas and have their own input goes. Have their fiction read live, or their talents showcased once a month or something.
Yeah probably to make the pitch sound cartoony
14A weekly podcast would be awesome.
AHHHHH
NOT FANFICS
NOT FANFICS!!!!!!!!!
Lawl
14Lmao
:(
Also, having a set polling system for users as to what they'd like to see, taking what's done during the lottery on BMN and having special segments during the week as well.
Trololo
it wouldnt sound right with the normal pitch having these clips playing
14But yeah, we could always filter it of course so nothing like Cupcakes gets through. :P
07I like her ideas
14Dari is such a troll. lol
yeah, she's got some good ideas
14Yeah, shes certainly got some nice ideas going.
minus the fanfic readings :P
they have an applejack one with normal speed audio
>mfw you're going to make ME read them out loud as punishment >.<
07Why do you want to be a BMN moderator?
Yeah, but it fits Applejack
I dunno about that, most PMVs use normal audio
14Well, some fanfics are alright. lol But I dont know how many people would stick around for it.
Though sped up works with the Pinkie Pie Numa Numa video

14I really like the idea of a weekly podcast though.
I believe that I can help the site grow through word of mouth, and contributions, both thought and planwise. I also enjoy social gatherings specifically on Brony Movie Nights and like to make sure that every member is being treated well and having an enjoyable time.
why must the plastic around new cds be so annoying?
14I wanted us to do something similar to what EqD does, where we chat back and forth about various things. But... Skype, ugh!
>still buys cds
Yeah I know of Firefly
I occasionally do that.
I still buy CDs too, I like having the lyrics and info in a booklet
There's a few stores where it's cheaper than buying the album on iTunes
...not all that often though
RobotPinkie: That'd be good if they still did that.
Last CD I bought was Pokemon the Movie.
Not even lyin'
07the only trouble I see now is her availability
i like to have the artwork for the albums
Also, being able to help other mods so that there isn't too much pressure or stress on them.
14Looks like she was well-prepared for this. She be a sneaky one. :P
14And yeah, I know. :(
Um, they quite often do, FreezeFrame

RobotPinkie: Not half the ones I've gotten of late.
I guess it depends on what music you listen to, I dunno
Maybe I should check online before buying CDs...
When I first heard that I song went lol.
Last CD I purchased was Straight Outta Lynwood by Weird Al
07For clarification purposes; you mentioned your availability earlier,if you attend a movie night do you watch the entire show or only the mane section?
and CD lets me do that :P
Buying 'em on iTunes does that, too
it does?
iTunes hasn't had DRM in years.
Otherwise they would've sunk harder than the titanic
/me knows she also likes RP
so you can now get uncompressed music DRM-free from iTunes?
14Aww :P
/me 14isn't much an RPer
I make sure to stay for as long as possible. Only once have I had to leave before the entire event was over.
/me 14now feels left out lol
14Eh, only once had to leave early.
Yup
07hmm
Because then I guess I might buy a lot less CDs :P
It's Apple Lossless Codec, but you can convert that inside iTunes
07so she does stay?
its just personal preferance. No need to argue
We ... aren't arguing
07I see, thank you
stop fight!!! please!
this is madness!!
07That concludes the first part of the interview, we're gonna move on to the second part of the interview now.
Well as long as it's lossless, you can convert it to whatever you like, so that's awesome
14Well, she said only once has she had to leave before the entire event was over. So I'm assuming that means she's been around for all the ones shes attended the entire time, except once.
07I'm going to show you some images and I want you to tell me how you would respond as a mod if they were posted in the chat.
07Please tell me when your ready
ok ima buy from Itunes from now on. I still cannot get this platic off
lol Synros
07did you voted on CAJ yet?
14Yeah...
14lol
If I had more money, I'd be buying Season 1 in HD right now, actually
14Nope.gif
I am ready.
Season 1 Blu-Ray can't be out already
I dunno, some CDs I'll probably still buy
14Her body is ready!
WhatPayne: S1 is on iTunes

Of MLP?
Unfortunately, I only have 50 bucks, and I need to get some breakfast food for weekends, since the cafeteria on campus doesn't open until 11 on weekends
Srs?
anyone wanna come over and help me? this is getting depressing
Hard copy?
Yes, AllisZero
Very happy I got Icky Thump as a CD, nice booklet
No, iTunes
Eh
I don't iTunes
07Let's see how she handles these
I want the DVD just to have the box
Neither do I.
It's 50 bucks for the HD version of every ep
are iTunes videos also DRM free?
14Yeah, this is the tough part. At least it was for me.
Let me check the file on the free ones I have
14If you've got a different guideline to this like I did that you're used to, it can be difficult.
Me too, even if the artwork would be horrible, I would want to buy the case.
I want the Blu Ray box, if they make one :3
because that will look awesome
Looks like it may, since it wouldn't open in Media Player Classic
07but you can keep practicing with these
The picture you have posted has some heavy implications to mature content. This is a verbal warning, try to keep in mind that this is a chat group for all ages.
07there's many pony images allover the web
and if it doesn't, I'll just print a custome cover for it :P
But then again, MPC's been being shitty for me.
14Yeah, I'm still trying to wean myself into it.
RobotPinkie I would do the exact same!
Ah okay, FreezeFrame
14I know, you should see my pic archive on my computer. XP
Okay, it does
07Second image:
But that's probably a concession to the video owners
07show me
Just did few new covers to my PS3 games recently
I just tried in WMP, that failed, too
14I've just always been used to a more lax stance on images, so its something I'm still working on.'
14XD
Ah okay
Wrek
14I dont have it uploaded anywhere atm. lol
I like the PS3 games that do the art on the opposite side
I'm thinking of doing that too, WhatPayne. Some have pretty awful cover art
WREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK!
This thread helped me a bunch: http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=442713

oooh, thanks for the link, WhatPayne
No problem. :)
That image contains graphic sensual material and is inappropriate for this chat group. Do not post material of this kind.
14Ah, okay. Was going to ask if we had a time for it.

14During the broadcast? Might be kinda hard to keep an eye on the chat too, but I guess we'll manage.
and someone has made a custom Splatterhouse cover, yay!
07We are a super-team we be fine ;)
14:P
14We gonna have it in here or you prefer Skype?
07I think here
dunno why I love those games so much...
07but we'll see
14I wish Skype would work for our conference calls. But then we'd probably just have everyone talking over each other.
Nice. If you have decent inkjet printer and photograph paper, these are quite easy to print yourself.
/me only has a color laser
Might be able to, I just need to get more ink for it :P
I don't get it, gave a verbal warning for the first picture.
She seemed to be on the right track.
im bored
But the second picture she just said "Don't post that".
lasers can do good job too. I have no direct experience tho but knowing there is laser photo paper, it should work.
Rather than stating a course of action.
14She might be used to the same type of guidelines I've been.
This picture, while it does contain minor sensual material, in my view is suitable for this chat.
07:P
14Whats wrong to some isnt wrong to others. :P
Everything alright, Luna?
I argued that point with Ghosties and some other mods already.
I wouldn't bother.
14Think I've also been desensitized by /b/ over the years too however. :P

Luna, I mean, lol
07nailed it
Man, people should make custom FiM covers for games...
I just saw quite gross picture of Fluttershy
07Alright, that was the last part of the interview.
I'd totally print and use those :P
14Yup yup.
it got really cold in my room when I looked at Fluttershy's face in that MW3 picture.....
14She dun good on that one.
07Do you have anything to add?
I'm sorry to hear that, WhatPayne
RobotPinkie, I've been thinking the same
Are you aware of Tryponyphobia?
/me decides to read Loosenin' Up
Because Octavia/Soarin'
I might actually give it a go sometime, WhatPayne, I do a lot of image editing :3
14Wait, am I getting shipping with Soarin?
I'm sure someone who's a proper artist could do a much better job, though...
Yes you are Octavia
I do too, even through I linked that thread I just had to make my own covers.
14imokaywiththis.jpg
Oh wow... I could use the Scoota Fisher pic to make a custom cover for the Splinter Cell Trilogy that's coming out
14But he loves THAT BIG APPLE PIE more
Only that I thank you for your time and the opportunity to apply for this position. I look forward to your verdict.
My head just exploded a bit at that thought
07We will discuss your interview with the rest of the team.
07Please join our next regular BMN show as we will post further recruitment updates there.
14Still a little confused about her times though. Since I'm not used to European times, I had to look it up. Seems to be confusing me a little so far though...
ha
That's quite brilliant. Be careful or soon there's going to be a new trend ponifying games
no, he just likes pie in general
07feel free to ask her
octavia=Pinkie Pies sister
If that becomes a trend, then I will be very happy :P
07and I hate dem timezones too...
14Well, she stated her times fine. But so far I'm getting times that arent even during BMN...
Thank you. I will, the update is at the beginning, correct?
I think there is a peice outside my window RobotPinkie, I'll mail it back to you
07Yes, but sometimes we contact candidates before the show
07well ask her now :)
lol thanks, Synros
Okay, thank you, I will be here either way, just for clarification purposes.
07saves us from any trouble in the future
14Its 9:30pm there right now. She said shes available from 5:30pm until maybe 1am her time. That seems early in the day
14Not sure how to ask her.
may take a couple days, postal service here sucks
thats some hardcore tachycardia
sounds like a plan, Luna
oshitson dari in deep trouble xD
FOREMAN, GTFO YOU AFFECTED INDIVIDUAL
YOU ARE A PATIENT NOW
07you are a pirate *cough*
oh look french winterwrap up on eqd =p
10French WWU?! I'M THERE
:3
LOL
10also: cool I'll open the stream page for some House in a minute :D
Hey, the fun bot.
4HE'S SUPER SPECIAL PATIENT, LEVEL 8
Pfft, French. :P
levuru eito
YOUR VERY OWN CUSTOMIZABLE THERMOMETER
whos french?
so is that part of the script, dari?
4You are
Is what?
no, I am Russian
DecapKing, the winter wrapup
You are a French pirate.
4NO, you're Navajo
:p
I made a the script to check if the current latest title is different from what it was last time it was checked, then I set up a timer which automatically starts when I connect to this server that starts up a check every 30 seconds.
...thought so. Kudos, my man, kudos!
Thanks.
I remember you saying the 30 seconds part, but i completely forgot you'd have to do the check title thing.
:3
anyone know how long to put on one of those suits? freaking long time.
so it turns out that eqd's hit count is so high cause Dari keeps refreshing the page.
XD
lol
4I like this Foreman better. He actually has a sense of humor now
hahahaha
also, House always says "People never change." What're all your opinions on this? i'm interested to know
Partly true.
4The more things change, the more things stay the same
4That's the saying, right?
Hmm
You can change on the exterior, but deep inside you will always be the same person.
Same shit different day also works.
4Awww, Happy Foreman left :(
what about, Dermathil, that 'one year' thing? they say it takes one year of a facade before that becoues your genuine personality.
Sumica: S.S.D.D. / F.N.G. :P
I like to think that you can change.
Never heard of that hting before, Daz.
Dermathil, i think i read it somewhere in some motivational thread on 4chan's /b/ a few years ago or something. Yea, i think i did.
4OH GOD

4IT'S HAPPY TIME ON HOUSE
DEAD
Ghosties, this is just dark, not grimdark.,
LOL
HE DIED
That's your fate Foreman.
LOL I thought you meant Jack White working with ICP, Ghosties
You're going to die horribly.
I was just about to agree, too
10;_________________;
:P
:P
4Meh, I don't care for either Jack White or ICP
quoted to the letter xD
Lol Daz.
I wub Jack White
4It's of no grave concern
Already been through this.
haha
And that's not quoted to the letter.
:P
http://pitchfork.com/news/43861-jack-white-teams-up-with-insane-clown-posse/
zomg they broke the rules, house did't pull a mirical out of his arse
THIS IS A TWO-PARTER
4That episode was completely fucked up
i was there dari i meant it as a joke, and durr course it's not quoted to the letter xD
well, Dermathil, a protagonist IS dying
10Lol dat montage
10Foreman got owned

Grimdark is when everything is ALWAYS looking bleak.
10lolol
Exactly Dermathil. Jack White and ICP covering Mozart

That's pretty damn bleak
STEAM
Robotpinkie, it isn't ALWAYS bleak.
4They should have House and Jack team up in a wacky wildwind family adventure with terrorists and viruses
07steam why u start up!
There aren't limbs flying around
stream is fine for me
07not stream :P
ICP+Jack White covering mozart=Warhmmaer 40k levels of grimdark
07Steam
take that bed
It's ICP, I'm pretty sure limbs will be flying around :P
Oh gawd he gon blindeded
biopsied a mattress :P
Well that was a let down.
Autopsy on Foreman?
I wanted to see his eye explode and brain matter go everywhere.
:(
Best intro theme. I just wanna say this again: why in the blazes are there different intro themes for different coutries?!?
4Yes, let's kill Foreman so we can save him
4Makes perfect sense!
spoilers: [spoiler]
I think that's a good plan, Ghosties :P
So 2parter meens dickaround for 80min then pull out he cure.
they gonna cure death
ikr Sumica
/me dies of spoilers
I don't like Foreman so much anyway, except when he's a dick to House
dat shot of foreman's chair
foremans cool
4I like Foreman a lot
Foreman's the man
4I like all of the original team
fuck.... forgot my water boiler
chase is worst pony
tea is massively delayed :(
>House geniunely givesadamn about Foreman. :3
RobotPinkie: wat still not had that tea?!?
but but
4That's because House is the ultimate tsundere
tsundere?
is that a trope?
4:3
if so i dunno what it is
4Tsundere means a person is generally cold and distant at first, but eventually warms up to partners or other characters
I-it's not like I want to diagnose you or a-anything, baka.
4In House's case, his Tsundereism is extreme
ah i see. thanks for that Ghosties
AllisZero: desudesu
4Yep
Lol
desudesu indeed
That mouse is seeing places :3
If the rat dies, it's good.
It is it is?
Cute mouse
Then we can mash its head with a hammer and find a cure.
Yay!
4>pounds on numbers
4>thinks he's called his dad
4LOLWUT
Tea is almost done, yay!
nice! what one today, RobotPinkie ?
I had arabic tea today :3
They need to put a picture of House and put it below the definition.
Tea-flavored?
Wait, that was his rat?
Cane shaped object
That's mean House
"Forest fruit" tea, Daz. I presume that means "berries" :P
4TAKE YOUR TOP OFF
Especially considering all the berries on the box
....

OOooOoOOOoOooOO

House is the best family doctor EVER
4This whole season finale is absolutely bizarre and horrifying
I wouldn't touch that hand
Ghosties, did you miss the Mandarin teen with nonenglishspeaking mother and House y/day?
I was more concerned with "she be masturbatin'"
4I must have missed it
i was calling the scene, herospirit :P
RIGHT when I walk in.
I wish I had a doctor as cynical and hilarious as house.
10same D_E xD
and Ghosties well, the daughter tells mother in chinese what House says, and house goes "What no!" "you speak mandarin?" "well, i can count to 10 and ...*says 'your daughter's pregnant' in mandarin*"
twas so cash
Denied_Existence, he hasn't told people to go break limbs just so he'd have something to put in their file like my doctor has. :p
SUDDENLY VOMIT

CHOOSE YOUR DESTINY! *fights* FINISH HIM ... FATALITY. FLAWLESS VICTORY
The day House makes a pony reference is the day we win the internets, all of them
actually Ghosties srs nao: is it good?
i have played some of old ones only
indeed, Denied_Existence, that would be so much win
eyup
what about pony farm
Denied_Existence: Seasan eightan. one can dream, man.
House outing himself as a brony... well I can dream, at least
Which might not be that unlikely, there has been Stephen Colbert easter egg in House
You mean the day that The Stig listens to pony music while driving around the test track
dat lie
EVEN MY DREAM WAS NINJA'D! FFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUU-
it's GOTTA HAPPEN. house played ninja gaiden black, metroid fusion and metroid prime hunters, and COD6...and probably others i forget.
Silvermane I promise there is a pony farm at the bottom of that pit.
Red vs Blue after this episode plaese
RobotPinkie, the ninja'd guy!
Denied_existence, I'm okay. don't need a farm, when I have allll of Bronystate
There's a Stephen Colbert photo behind House's desk. It's still there in the later seasons
if i had streamer privlages, i could stream them, i have all the movies
"momma told me"
R! P! R! P! R! P! RP the ninja'd guy

House is awesome
10that child actor was awesome
"EFEN HIS SHNEESHESH ARE ADOWABLE"
WILSON
He always has the epiphany when something unrelated happens.... damn.
LOLOL
Dark_Heart, give it a rest. The more you ask, the less likely it's going to happen.
fine
House is such a class act
...LAWL
dat ass
lol
Here have a question: If you could summon pinkie by throwing a party, what would you have to do to summon the other mane 6?
A YOUR MOM JOKE
haha ha
4DAT PLUMP ASS
OH MY GOSH
@POMFmeter
6 You are 51% POMF. (1581)
Ghosties: indeed.

4@smashmeter Dr_Cuddy
6 Dr_Cuddy is 13% smash. (1583)
lawl Dashite
Well that didn't work.
4Pffft, whatever
Ok,i'm back to myself.
10lol ghosties
@POMFmeter Cuddy
6 Cuddy is 45% POMF. (1584)
4She's at least 20% smashable
now to administer the medicine
smashing good show chaps
Hey Hat. What kind of hat are you?
POMF?
.... Pomf?
i can be anything you want me to be
*Pomf*
Team Hat tress 2
ohhhh wingboner noise
I'm betting hat is a trilby
Do I have to google pomf?
Abrahat Linkon
RobotPinkie: Have. You. Played. 5 days a stranger. ?
eeewwww
wat
POOP THROUGH THE MOUTH
And what show is this?
5 days a stranger?
Goo!
Where's scotaloo's EWWWWW
poop?
wow, south park was right...
Oh, House...
Ghosties, have some insane logic: Non-mods and un-mods can't type in colors, but isn't white a color?
EWWW
RobotPinkie: insanelygood game. main character has a trilby hat. he's called Trilby. :P.
talk about a backup
LOL
WHOS HUNGRY? MEXICAN TAKEOUT?
*Insaneface*
oopsie
yahtzee?
hopefully some more ponies will have hats in series 2
I'll have to look that up, Daz
JENGA
2,14 here's some counter insane logic: white is the absence of color :P
if only because trilby hats are best hats
Hey Hat,could you be a "Bill's hat" plz?
the game is by ben yahtzee croshaw, yea, DecapKing. it's freeware RobotPinkie
>Denied implying IRC text has a true color in the absence of color codes
is it about people dying?
RobotPinkie, you know the yahtzee funny reviewer guy? yea, he made that game
ValtheJean But white light is made up of ALL colors right?
cause i might of played it
DecapKing, well people die alright :P
Hat is totally a Fedora cause they are awesome.
it's about Body Mind Soul and "It hurts it hurts it hurts"
Denied_existence, white Pigment is the absence of the colors
Some bedside manner...
Nice, Daz
"Francis, is there anything you don't hate?"
Silvermane Are you hating on me for being fair-skinned?
Definitely going to play it now :P
/me shoots Silvermane yet again,now with no apparent reason
Googling "POMF" did not make any sense,
denied_existence, yes. Cracka
/me cries.
pomf is the sound of a wingboner makes
/me lulz
RobotPinkie: reason it's good is a) excellent story, considering 1 guy did it. b) all pixelart, yay, and short games c) I don't think i've ever goosebumped or :Ofaced at any other game as much as that one. srslydude the ending i-OK im srs remembering it i just got another goosebump
also, it comes from a lolicon hentai, i do believe
I AM GOING TO URBAN DICTIONARY "Pomf"
ahaha
no spoilan plz!
oh... That makes more sense
lawl Denied_Existence
I'll definitely play it though, Daz
WhatPayne: POMF is a hybrid meme of wingboner and that lolicon manga meme. someone pasted the "POMF =3" sound effect onto a pic of Rainbow Dash's wingboner springing up and it snowballed
RobotPinkie, i won't if you don't want. but suffice to say it's awesome freeware :3
Love Zero Punctuation, so.
Pomf is what you do when you do that thing with the stuff and whatnot wherever you are.
EEEEWWWWW
Why I did not know that meme?
POMF	435 up, 21 down The sound you make when you fall backwards onto the bed while being a little girl.
/me unfurls his wings rapidly. They make a *pomf* sound
Ignore the numbers there
ya RobotPinkie if you know zero punctuation you hafta play it. actually, play 5daysastranger, then 7daysaskeptic then trilbysnotes, which has an insane ending, then 4th of quadrology: 'Six Days a Sacrifice.' BLOODY HELL dat ending
*Ahem*Gentlemen?
I copypastad
Successful house is successful
*Ahem* Pegacorn?
/me has a dead Spy on his shoulder
@POMFmeter Cutty's ass
6 Cutty's ass is 25% POMF. (1585)
BACKGROUND FLASH
what up Pegacorn ?
When he presses the music player the galaxy unfolds in his office
Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw is the dude's name.
lol
eyup
EUREKA
@assmeter Cuddy's POMF
6 Cuddy's POMF is 95% ass. (1586)
/me bites into his Samvich.
House knows all
lawls
There was a Spy next to the door.
they found oil
I killed him.
And I can't recall one of my teacher's names.
/me 's Samvich was a spy!
So if I got this right Pomf=wingboner. And Cuddy is 45% wingboner inducing.
Hmmm... *NOM*
yes
Pegasi, so inappropriate
