never said cosplay itself is bad and that all cosplayers are disgraceful
i said it's disgraceful if they start doing it and such and acting like the character in a setting that doesn't call for it

jsut don't do it in an area where you have no buisiness doing it
pretty much

Dat auto kick
Hey everypony I'm back, finally
00,10cause people still bring it up
Yeah, no one says gack anymore
I HATE THAT BUCKING WORD
Until the next episode and its commercials. Then it starts right back up.
still people brings it up
and then, it'll be in this week's commercials.
And it looks like somethings finally happening
shouldn't have posted that.
STOP SAYING GAK

about Background Ponies
story of te blanks
Interview?
I don't know
Hello everypony. Feels like it's been a while..
my stream keeps stuttering too much
ie. Empire is not necissarily evil and Kingdoms good, or Queens evil - Princesses = good
further note
no BG ponies episode
they focus on the mane 6
dang
or as NC said: "Princess? You are the defacto Femaile Ruler, Queen it up bitch"
fandom fills in for BG Ponies
they really have to get a very GOOD reason to interact with the mane 6
Agreed with them. No need for BG pony eps. >_>
but yeah that's the best thing cause think of it that way
hmm this song seems very familar

Welp, I won't be playing WoW for a bit. I needs moneys to buy it

/me duct tapes Jmo's hands together
then again fluttershy can be wrath
since at the given circumstances she can be deadly
and that would leave Twilight with Envy

00,02whats that?
00,02aniderp, ikr
wut
seaponies~ <3
.....again
now i feel even worse that ive hardly seen much of the show
its sad :<
liek dis if u cri evry tiem
her crying at the end :<
00,02my little dashis is that verry blunt kind of sad
or even the End of Ponies
even though I haven't read it yet
but it look like sob material
Saturn: :D
well yeah
but that end of horses thing
that's something that makes a dictionary say damn
I enjoyed Background Pony even though it's pretty wordy
i'm going to write a story
and it'll be sadder
badder
08,01MLD is not very well written
???
08,01Buytoast: hahaha
08,01<3
i hate my router
:'(
and its not badly written
shit, warsol isn't even a word
08,01SkunkTari: heh, you've not read many fics then
i have read the Vegabond one too
00,02eating my gun
b-b-but Saturn! it has scary parts and it's known by people!
it has to be good!
6_9
08,01romance reports is a fantastic (NSFW) fanfic
08,01Macintosh is brilliant too (SFW)
08,01Fallout: Equestria
08,01SkunkTari: i did
08,01i've read tons of fanfics
MAYO/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
Saturn, have you had time to read Background Pony?
well
more often
08,01CrystalPhoenix: I did, aye
good song
Not gonna click that link because its their opinion
Saturn, you read it all?
08,01i've read most of it
back
and i fell on my floor ;_;
how .-.
well..
08,01it was quite well written
i lost balance
08,01oh! read Celestia's Teeth!
08,01it's hilarious!
Soilder must go, his people need him
*badly
owning a pony
XP really?
owning a pony?
08,01SkunkTari: because people have no taste
that too
and yeah add Buytoat and Saturn points
hmmmmmm
http://i.imgur.com/sGCe4.jpg
08,011) people have bad taste, 2) people have a fantasy of owning a pony/having a daughter
i could write a shitty story that ends with something sad
and get people to cry
does that make it good?
maybe
/me 08,01wants a daughter
Saturn: Sure, you can have one. . .but you get Babs sEed.
I wouldn't mind having a kid and tell that kid my philosophic rambles
Ha ha ha.
i personally think it was very well written and had a very good backstory
i dont want any kids
08,01RawketLawnchair: i wouldn't mind Babs Seed as a daughter
BACKSTORY?
It had no backstory whatsoever
he was nothing, noone
he was bland
oh man, you made me bust a gut there
which actually is a cheap way to sink the reader in
easier to connect it with yourself if the protagonist has no character
08,01MadSurge: she was adorable
MLD is also filled with plot-holes
08,01she was okay by the end of it
IS THIS THOSE FLIM FLAM DRUNK SINGERS?
wha wha whaaaaaa
That couch ain't goin' no where.
08,01 i just want to say
waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
keep crying baby!
XD

Damn C4 pro's...

I'm up to the start of episode 37
Oh gawrd xD
T^T I dunno if I want my ponysona to be a unicorn, or a pegasi pony
^
Okay. :3
And with that, I always tend to gravitate towards flight/speed related spells, or like in Halo 4, use the Jetpack
Hmm, I've always went for the sneak, theif-like characters...
Usually with a tad of magic if I'm not playing saneak.
da magics!
'dat pew pew
After I watch ponies, I have to figure out if I should play Halo 4, or Dungeon defenders.
Actually, I probably need need to play Halo 4
Be a bass and play both at the same time :P
boss*
ok me 2 but i have a qustion
Deducation :D
sry for my english D
ehh
Dedication*
do you think they have destroyed halo?
multiplayer that is
i think they have made it into cod mini :/
I did'nt play halo but a friend said the multiplayer looks like cod too.
i'll go
bb
Wat.
come on...
yea
Kill streaks in Halo 4?
orr
...
not exakely
when you have killed some people you get a bonus like a wepon or bost
-.-'
wow
..

you are joking right
Killstreaks don't mean that I ain't MLG in it! >: D
pls xD
Wait...
*game
Levels affect gameplay now?
Wat.
yea
soo
yea...
At this rate, I don't think I'm ever going to try another Halo...
yea but!
they need to make a battlefront 3
Although ODST was fun when I was over at a friend's.
the campain is actually good in my oppinion
^
:$
but well master chif is not a emo anymore in the campain xD
You don't know how many times I've waited on news about that
*chef

bye!
bye Dark92- damn
oops
:P
sorry
All 6mane are best pony
manes*
Âj i think but i like them all
*Aj
Twilight is best pony (and Chrysalis)(And Luna)
If you are voting only one pony
Applejack!
i like luna to but we hardly see her :/
Fluttershy :(
*hoof
thx
my english is not that good :/
I like Twilight alot mainly because I act like her...alot
woo! reading!
but we cant compare the mane 6, they are all good. :)
in my oppinion atleast
Derpy is best background pony :3
but we can compare background ponies
:D
any ponies are allowed in the vote
they should make an episode where its nothing but background ponies
no spoilers!
:I
Plz no spoilers
i mean there the main cahrs full with lines and everything
05no talk about unaired S3 episodes
Kay
I failed miserably for the first two episodes
We're not spoiling.
but can we talk about the episodes that are allready out?
Yes
Oh
Okay
Screw you
well i am out, have a great time everypony! cya :)
Oh stop bitching about that
you don't get partners
I never used the partners that often anyway, I used one and that was it
i would like to exuse my spam
Its called experimenting..
which means if you have no money or crappy stickers you won't win
i did....
You should have no excuse to not have stickers
bosses usually have some gimmick to beat them you wouldn't see unless you lose to them at least once
Or money
and.... i dont want too
woo hoo
but
You can run from any fight anyway
oh boy
OH BOY
Which theater was hijacked?
They arent that hard to find
Okay.
the theaters all have the same stream
^
Oh.
<.<
but the third boss is nice
specially with how he attacks
I liked how the boss clapped to the music
Who's getting FarCry3?
Me
oh
Is there a fight going on?
I am fine
outside of that stupid spin gimmick
Yea...not as interactive as Goombario/Goombella
the help is nothing
no one is gertting far cry
its bad
FarCry isn't bad.
far cry.....hu, no
It's quite good.
honestly, if they had made the thing stickers just some sort of meter thing rather than have you have to go and either buy em or track em down again i'd be fine with it all
gak gak
no
Again you have no excuse to not have stickers, they're everywhere
i'm not talking about the shit little stickers
i'm talking about the 3d item ones
Twitchy-twitcha, twitcha-twitch:O
How do you reply to someone?
I never used those that often in battle except for bosses
That's sad. A fellow Tennessean coming on, just to spam that which must not be named
you need specific ones to fight the bosses or interact with certain things
You only need like 1 or two per boss
but I shouldn't need to purposely lose a fight just to figure out how to be something
nor have to run away
but yeah, hints are sorta lacking there
weepin_pegasi82 thanks
because i thought i needed a musical sticker
when the thing i really needed was completely different
although i do know they drop hints sometimes during the fight
It said I needed the faucet besides the sponge, but I never used it because when I got sprayed I didnt get poisioned
and sometimes the enviroment hints too
it just told me to get something absorbant
after i looked it up
ZOOM OUT
how far are you exactly?
Just beat the third boss yesterday
*it's
then you wouldn't know about the fifth one
Actually I do
Oh sorry...
I just tried to skip forward on the stream.. *facepalm*
i like him being the boss and all
EY TEGLO GIT UR PIC WHERE I CAN SEE IT PROPER 'KAY LAD
everythign else fits the level
and then you get him
gak ant
Stoker Stair
Delish <3
never heard
At first I thought the Leaf sticker was a joke item, turns out its pretty usefull combined with the Battle Spinner
i never used it
i get excellents naturally
<.<
Sigh, how can anyone listen to this music..
I am now :P
its like audio cancer
good to know
you know what's disgusting?
Oh jesus..mute it and stop bitching
them Communist Terrorists
<3
Yes!
YES
Åskfödd~
lol
Shouldn't you be able to see the right ear?
cant rush perfection
*ibland
Well Malm, if he puts up enough hair there, you wouldn't see it.
Oh hes already done the right ear
?
Also I have a tendancy not to map things out when I start drawing, I can't speak for how Teglo does it.

wow:)

......................................................................
Do not spam, gravy.
yeah don't put gravy on spam!
Thats the worst opinion ive ever heard
positive critism is always good
opinions are forbidden here
Some times it pays to be blunt
no i agree with his last post
/me ahem
best pony ever :3
It seems as though we got a NEAIGHHH sayer here...
o dear
that was awful
That was bad.
yep
gak
I think the joke went over his head.
Some times it doesnt pay to make people feel good when they've done something wrong, it sometimes works to be blunt
gak
i dont complain about everything, just.. a few things.
he doesn't complain, i've only seen him critisize
ugh x.x
^
nothing like ruining the day with a bad neighbor
well i do that too
like yellow quiet being the best horse
Fact? he sure states things the most negative way possible
You really don't.
opinions are landmines
And how is "the bent leg seems a bit short" the most negative way possible?
i can not see her mane
http://tinyurl.com/d7n79cm
Gotta go and make pytt i panna!
^ Fitting for this
ant hes drawing it as we speak
We don't take too kindly to "opinions" and "criticsm"
