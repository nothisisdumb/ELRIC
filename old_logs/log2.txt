<Soul> 06of all days
<Aurora> 06my ankle decides TODAY it'll be sore
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02o3o
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02wow
<Aurora> 06the day I had a horribly buy day at work
<Aurora> 06now it's about dead -_-
<Light_Lati> 12D:
<Aristeo> I just realised something
<Light_Lati> 12my ankle was sore 2 days ago o3o
<Light_Lati> 12well, now 3 **looks at clock*
<Nyte> what's that
<DarkTruth> that I ate your brainses ?
<Light_Lati> 12-*
<Proto> o_O
<Aurora> 06my ankle is permanently messed up, so every now and then it hurts like hevk
<Proto> thief
<Aurora> 06heck
<Stormy> o,o
<Stormy> *o.o
<Aurora> 06imagine the feeling that it needs to be popped, like cracking your back
<DarkTruth> :3
<Aurora> 06but it hurts whenever you put pressure on it
<Light_Lati> 12O.O
<Light_Lati> 12owwww ._.
<Aurora> 06and then if you try popping it, which I've discovered it wont do, that just hurts even more
*Corevette789 waits for a paragraph from Aristeo
<Aristeo> Oh, hehe
<Aristeo> I was doing math
<Aristeo> Sorry to leave you all hanging
*Shiny-Growlithe thinks
<Aristeo> I was only alive for 1/723684210 of the existance of the universe
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Have you tried putting heat on it?
*Aurora considers
<Aurora> 06yeah
<Aurora> 06I've tried everything
<Aurora> 06it's been 5 years
<Nyte> o.o
<Stormy> Once in another channel Aristeo said "I know what will lighten the mood!" and then forgot he said it and made everyone wait
<Stormy> :P
<Aristeo> xD
<Nyte> lol
<Corevette789> LOL
<The_Darkness> 5 years of that?
<Proto> Only 1 billionth of 1% of the water on the earth is drinkable, according to Purita or w/e makes those drink filters
<Aristeo> I go off trying to get the link, then get distracted with Justin Bieber videos
<Key> 10you not dying
<Light_Lati> 12wb Pokestar~
<DarkTruth> eww :X
<Stormy> XD
<Light_Lati> 12Roara
<Aurora> 065 years of off and on irritation
<Light_Lati> 12have the doctors told you what's wrong with it?
<Aurora> 06like I said, some days it's fine
<Light_Lati> 12(if you have seem them that is)
<Aurora> 06LL, I went in for Xrays, they said there's nothing wrong
<Aurora> 06I think it healed wrong, though
<Light_Lati> 12O.O
<Light_Lati> 12thats horrible D:
<Corevette789> ...whats a FAT32 error?
<Aurora> 06I sprained it pretty bad, and we wondered if maybe there was a fracture
*Light_Lati huggles Roara
<Aurora> 06considering the fall I took was kinda crazy
*Shiny-Growlithe assumes that if pressure, heat, cold, or popping isn't working then...
<Key> 10... somehow, I misread "Xrays" as "Xanxus"
<Key> 10._____.
<Proto> iirc it's a memory format thing
*LugiaLordOfTheSeas nibbles on Light_Latias randomly
<Proto> probably wrong though
<Light_Lati> 12o3o
<DarkTruth> your file system
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I'm guessing that your bone might be rubbing up against another bone
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Or your cartilage between the bones might be starting to fade away
*Light_Latias squeaks
<Light_Latias> 12Laa?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Which can also happen from healing wrong
<Light_Latias> 12oh, hai~ :o
<Aurora> 06dunno...from what I've heard about bone-on-bone, that hurts in a different way than this
<Corevette789> Okay, I made a ron of popups at school saying that because this guy told me to
*LugiaLordOfTheSeas huggles
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Irritation might be inflamation
<Aurora> 06that's supposed to be like a sharp pain, mine's kinda dull
<Key|Away> 10o3o brb~
<Corevette789> On startup approx 32 of those came up
<Key|Away> 10gotta go clean the tub
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02In that case, your bone might be rubbing up against some tissue and causing inflamation
<Chimera> :3
*Light_Latias huggles back
<Aurora> 06possibly
<Corevette789> Not real, of course
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14:3
<Proto> I forkbombed a school computer once
<Aurora> 06it's funny though
<Stormy> Good night everyone
<Proto> Bye Stormy
<Aurora> 06my best friend and I have the same problem on opposite ankles
<Proto> I was bored and unplugged it fast >.>
<Aurora> 06she sprained it falling off a rock, I sprained it falling from some stairs
<Aristeo> That girl in the Baby video was pretty hot though
<The_Darkness> what were you doing?
<Proto> out of context
<Key|Away> 10was it... uh...
<Proto> that sounds creepy
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Sprain huh?
<Aurora> 06walking to class lol
<Key|Away> 10the one that's a Gemini
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Well
<Key|Away> 10*blanking*
<Aurora> 06Key, yeh
<Stormy|Sleeping> looooool
<Key|Away> 10O: wow
<Key|Away> 10anyway, brb
<Aurora> 06the two of us have bizarre similarities
<Key|Away> 10XD
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Ah
<Key|Away> 10haha, I've noticed
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02You might've pulled a muscle
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02And it doesn't really heal, so now and then it will come back and hurt
<Aristeo> xD
<Light_Lati> 12stairs ><
<Corevette789> LOL
<Nyte> lol
<Aristeo> Her name is Jasmine Villegas
<Corevette789> I love this plave
<The_Darkness> times like these, glad I only have an attic over my head
*Light_Lati twisted its ankle on stairs and nearly caused a domino effect as a result ._.;;;
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14So liek what is everyone up to
*The_Darkness has only been tripped by the street
<Aurora> 06dunno....muscle being pulled, it's been like this for 5 years
<Aurora> 06that doesn't add up
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02My dad had the same thing happened
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02It's been about 15 or more years, but it still hurts him now and then
<Light_Latias> 12trying to ignore the pretzel calling from the kitchen...
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14xD
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Muscles/tendons pulled/ripped
<Aurora> 06I can understand the tendon having problems
<Aurora> 06that's what I've thought it was
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Because it's in your leg, it won't heal properly because you most likely use your leg every day
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02So it basically becomes pulled again
<The_Darkness> so it can't heal fully since its in use
<The_Darkness> and done with Pride
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Right
<The_Darkness> ghslfhslfhslabdkla I screwed up the neck
<SheenaFox> o3o
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02wb

<Spyrorocks> thats a pretty honest answer.
<Aurora> 06what was it?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02lol
<Spyrorocks> I bet you looked her up on facebook.
<Proto> It takes roughly 32years to count to 1billion if you count 1 per second :D

*Shiny-Growlithe yawns
<Proto> lol
<Proto> heh
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Hmm...what to do..
<Roara|Quiz> 06wow
<Aurora> 06I literally failed that quiz
<Aurora> 0640% o-o;
*Light_Lati uses Hypnosis on Shiny "You sleep. That's what you do" o3o
*Light_Lati hides
<Aurora> 06the sad part is, I might have one of the highest grades in the class by default, as a lot of people will have incomplete assignments
<Aurora> 06-_-
<Light_Lati> 12o.o
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Why in the world is my computer copying whatever I highlight?
<Light_Lati> 12that reminds me of what one of my friends said...
<Light_Lati> 12@Roara
<Light_Lati> 12she said how in her physics class
<Light_Lati> 12she was failing with a 50 average
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I'm an A/B student with a D average
<Light_Lati> 12and that she was one of the top students in that class ._.
<The_Darkness> my grade usually depends on the class
<Sparky|Away> 10and that works how?
<Sparky|Away> 10@Shiny
<Aurora> 06sparky
<The_Darkness> If its like "career investigation" I will fail it now
<Sparky|Away> 10yes?
<Sparky|Away> 10...
<The_Darkness> purposely for all reason
<Aurora> 06some classes are so ridiculous that a 50% is an A
<Sparky|Away> 2oh o-o
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Actually no lol
<Aurora> 06well, not technically
<Sparky|Away> 2and bbl o3o
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I can get A's and B's if I put my mind ot it and did my work
<Aurora> 06what I mean by an "A" is that a 50% is the highest of the class
<Kyu> 07o3o
<Aurora> 06...
<Aurora> 06ARGH
<Aurora> 06hang on
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02But I never have inspiration to do my work, so the only A's and B's I get are on my test
<Light_Lati> 12o3o
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02s
<Aurora> 06I though sparky was talking about LL
<Aurora> 06and so I was talking about LL's friend in physics
<Light_Lati> 12lolz
<Light_Lati> 12ohhh
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Oh I see lol
<Aurora> 06>_<
<Aurora> 06anyways Kyu
<Light_Lati> 12I was wondering why you were saying that o3o
<Light_Lati> 12<late-ish>
*The_Darkness puts LL in physics?
<Aurora> 06your plush makes me want to punt kittens
<Kyu> 07o3o
<The_Darkness> and she dropped the siccors on her toes twice and killed a random bystandered
<Aurora> 06twice isn't enough

<Aurora> 06I actually like the 10th for the most part
<The_Darkness> Also, Why is it that Don Bluth at the beginning made so many depressing films?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02The whole thing would've been better if they actually had the correct characteristics for each character
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Because he was actually free to do so
<Aurora> 06UGH

<Reshiram> 06someone here good with meter to feet conversions?

<Reshiram> 06you know that the game uses 4'10" as the trainer height, right?
<Zekrom> .
<Zekrom> :V
<Zekrom> yes
<Reshiram> 06so, both those statements are correct
<Zekrom> yes

<TimeShift> and why eww Netbooks drf?
<May|Chores> this didn't happen owo
*May|Chores goes away now
<TimeShift> my Lenovo ideaPad S10-3t is cool
*Twilight shall go all throughout dA and fav Silver pictures <3
<drf|work> I just don't like those tiny keyboards on netbooks, and the fact they have crappy CPUs
<drf|work> like 1.6GHz, what? I can't even play decent quality videos on one of those
<drf|work> and 15.4" isn't THAT much bigger than 10 or 11... and I've got a quad core with DDR3 RAM in mine...
<TimeShift> why should I want to watch videos on such a thingy, eh?
<drf|work> because?
<drf|work> I hate having the technology limit what I can do with it
<drf|work> I like being able to do whatever I want with what I have XD
<TimeShift> and by the way: My netbook is around 800 grams in weight....and the battery lasts 10(!) hours :)
<TimeShift> with 3G and WLAN enabled
<TimeShift> and I got a multitouch-screen
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I might be getting my android phone next week
<drf|work> cool
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Depends if the contract is accepted XD
<TimeShift> I like the techonolgy do what I want to do it. And besides: the keyboard is big enough for me to type with 10 fingers. And I got HUGE hands (ask Arti for it!)
<Lyalia> I have a netbook and a regular lappu.
<Lyalia> x3
<Lyalia> Ergh
<Twilight> 14SHINY
<Lyalia> what is with people having huge hands?
<Twilight> 14SLDFKJSDF
<Twilight> 14GO TO DA

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Hiya

<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14This be the android I might be getting http://shop.o2.co.uk/mobile_phone/specification/HTC/Desire
<drf|work> Unfortunately, we are unable to sell to countries outside the UK.
<drf|work> that's stupid
<drf|work> anyway, I recommend the Motorola Milestone
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14LOL
<drf|work> which is what i have, only called the Droid in America
<drf|work> same phone
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I hate motorola phones
<drf|work> ...
<drf|work> what'd they ever do to you?
<drf|work> I've had no problems with my phone
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I just don't like them
<drf|work> o.o
<drf|work> but it's a smartphone
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Plus HTC's are awesome
<drf|work> not like teh Razr
<Sneas|Shower> 03;3 to Azure
*Sneas|Shower RUNS
<Azure> 12LOL.
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14XD
<Azure> 12;D
<TimeShift> very flat :P
*Azure runs
<Sneas|Shower> 03bbs
<Sneas|Shower> 03xD
<Azure> 12Okay
<Azure> 12xDD
<TimeShift> a friend of mine had it quite some time ago
<TimeShift> and yeah, HTCs are decent
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I was going to get the Sony Ericsson Android phone, but yeah I had a go on the HTC Desire XD
<TimeShift> to fulfill your desire, eh?
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14LOL
<drf|work> XD
<drf|work> I've never had HTC, I have no problems with them, I just have no problems with Motorola either
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I still find it funny how the HTC Desire has 1GHz processor
<drf|work> and the Droid is an awesome phone
<drf|work> eh, that beats mine
<drf|work> does it have a keyboard?
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Touchscreen
<drf|work> oh
<drf|work> fail
<drf|work> I hate touchscreen keyboards
<TimeShift> like my Omnia II
<TimeShift> depends on how much you need to write
<Twilight> 14http://browse.deviantart.com/?q=PokeSpe%20Silver&order=9&offset=144#/d23amkd <-- sjkfhksjf
<Twilight> 14LANCe
<drf|work> Again, I don't want to be limited by the technology
*Twilight throws a car
<drf|work> and touchscreen keyboards are counter-productive to me
<drf|work> so therefore i refuse to get something without a physical keyboard
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14k lol
<Twilight> 14LANCE MUST DIEEE
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I also had a go on that iPad

<Reshiram> 06yeah
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Sewing machine's can't do it all
<Reshiram> 06but I'm working on a piece that a machine would be difficult for
<Roleplay4life> 05Oh. I see/
<Roleplay4life> 05**.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02[12:41] <Shiny-Growlithe> 02Sewing machine's can't do it all <--
<May> oh god
<May> they're making a remake for OoT
<Roleplay4life> 05No they can't do it all, but they're less finger-pricking than a needle and thread!
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02OoT?
<May> nintendo has killed many many things DX
<May> ya
<Roleplay4life> 05Then again they did invent THIMBLES... /winkwinknudgenudge
<May> for the new 3DS
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02OoT?
<May> Ocarina of Time
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I see

*May dies
<Reshiram> 06I hate thimbles
<May> money money money money that's all it's about
<Reshiram> 06I need full use of my fingers to actually control the needle
<Reshiram> 06dude
<Reshiram> 06OoT on the 3DS
<Reshiram> 06I'm sooooooooo ready for it
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Roara's all fired up about it XD
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02But then again, it's probably the same thing with Okami Den
<Reshiram> 06okamiden is for the DS
<Reshiram> 06it's got a scheduled release date already
*Shiny-Growlithe is talking about the money thing
<Reshiram> 06oh
<May> 2011, RIGHT?
<May> 8D
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I'm saying they might not have put too much time in it because they knew that Okami fans will want to buy it right away
<Reshiram> 06Im not even close to excited for it
<Reshiram> 06and I'm a massive okami fan
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Same o3o
<May> Shiny, you're right most of the time about things
<May> alot
<May> hopefully capcom put effort into it
<Reshiram> 06it's gonna fail
<May> hopefully
<TheDarkness> Shiny; it can never lie to you for being so SHIENE
<Reshiram> 06okami was a gam you can't really make a sequel from
<May> that's what I said first time
<May> it says something about a sequel, but then it doesn't
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02You could make a prequel though *shot*
<Reshiram> 06no, it takes place afterwards
<May> when does the 3DS come out? I kind of want to get OoT for he ds now
<May> *the
<Reshiram> 06dunno
<Reshiram> 06but OoT wont e for the DS
<Reshiram> 06be
<Roleplay4life> 05Uuung. There are too many prequels out there in general.
<Reshiram> 06I don't think it'll be a reverse-capable game
<May> I think I got accepted into my high school I wanted to go to
<Roleplay4life> 05Really? That's great May!
<May> that made my day
<Reshiram> 06choices for high school wut o-o
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02^
<Roleplay4life> 05Is it like a private school?
<Reshiram> 06I thought you do that for college
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02^
<May> I'm not going to my assigned one
<Roleplay4life> 05xD
<Reshiram> 06assigned one......wut
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02^
<May> and no, it's a charter out of my the borders
*Shiny-Growlithe flees
<Roleplay4life> 05I had choices for high school too.
<Reshiram> 06this coming from a girl where there's only one high school in my entire county
<Reshiram> 06unless you count the failure school
<Roleplay4life> 05I didn't apply to any private schools though 'cause they're expensive. And most of them are Catholic. >__>;;
<Roleplay4life> 05Awww. xD; "Failure school"?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Our county's school shut down years ago and became a house
<Reshiram> 06lol
*Twilight should attempt to draw another Yellow on the Oekaki
<Reshiram> 06RP, yeah
<TheDarkness> we have 2, rival ones
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02So we have to go to another county's school lol
<May> Roara, when you get of middle school, you usually are assigned a high school to go to depending on location
<Reshiram> 06if you flunk out of the main HS
<Reshiram> 06you go to that one
<May> well, at least out here in the lausd it is
<Roleplay4life> 05There are like twelve high schools in my city.
<Reshiram> 06and that one is pretty much a dilenquent school
<Reshiram> 06I drove by it once
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02That's how it is here too May
<Reshiram> 06there's a massive fence around it
<TheDarkness> So either way you get to hear "Down with!(insertschoolnamehere)"
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14wb Sneas :3
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Lol same with our two schools
<Glacymr> 12cookies
<May> but anyways, if you don't want to go to your "home" school, you have to apply to open enrollment to another
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02o3o
<Roleplay4life> 05We have three "alternative schools" too in my district. But that's 'cause we're inner-city.
<TheDarkness> tbh I hate both
<May> *for
<Reshiram> 06<May> Roara, when you get of middle school, you usually are assigned a high school to go to depending on location <-so it works how middle schools/elementray schools work then..
<May> exactly
<Reshiram> 06huh
<TheDarkness> what area do you live in then?
<Reshiram> 06I always thought high school would be a choice thing in bigger cities
<Roleplay4life> 05I had magnet school choices for Middle/Elementary school. o-o
<TheDarkness> no county is that centeralized
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02My middle school is connected to my high school o3o
<Azure|AFKish> 12Yus, WB :3
<Azure|AFKish> 12And
<May> the valley, Darkness, in Cali
<TheDarkness> in ways of having education planning that is
<Azure|AFKish> 12I might not be on a whole lot this week
<Reshiram> 06we have two middle schools, and a load of elementary schools
<Reshiram> 06plus 2 k-8
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14:<
<Azure|AFKish> 12Need to catch up and start some drawings before I leave Friday.
<Roleplay4life> 05I think there are over a hundred elementary schools in my district. /dies
<Azure|AFKish> 12xD
<Azure|AFKish> 12Like, now
<Reshiram> 06wow lol
<Azure|AFKish> 12for example
*Sneas is sad :<
<Roleplay4life> 05But some of them are small, like around 200 kids or so.
<May> big city?

<Roleplay4life> 05Um... kind of. ^^;
<May> I love those two
<Roleplay4life> 05Odyssey = pretty different from Antigone/Oedipus/etc.
<Reshiram> 06EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW OEDIPUS
<Roleplay4life> 05Oedipus was probably the most inappropriate thing I've ever had to read for school LOL. It could've easily been made into an R-Rated movie. xD
<Reshiram> 06I had to read it in frosh year
<Reshiram> 06._.;;
<Roleplay4life> 05But Roara it was EPIC.
<Reshiram> 06nooooooooooooooooooooo
<Roleplay4life> 05Way better than Odyssey~
<May> owO
<Roleplay4life> 05Odyssey was HORRIBLE.
<Reshiram> 06never read odyssey
<Reshiram> 06so ha
<May> I don't wanna read that it sounds like
<Reshiram> 06May
<Roleplay4life> 05Well if you read it you'd know how bad it was.

<TheDarkness> RP: we're reading that next year XD
<May> oh wait
<May> YES
<Reshiram> 06where a boy falls in love with his mother
<TheDarkness> INCESY
<Roleplay4life> 05That's basically the whole play.
<May> yeah
<Reshiram> 06it's basically a story about where that term came from
<TheDarkness> &T
<May> compared to kataan
<Reshiram> 06and its....a disturbing play
<May> *kataang
<Roleplay4life> 05Oedipus falls for his momma and there's lots of suicide and stuff.
<May> I've heard of that
<May> creepy
<Roleplay4life> 05That's basically the whole play.
<Reshiram> 06and I remember something about someone missing their eye
<TheDarkness> RP: because of incest? o3o
<Roleplay4life> 05Yup!
<Reshiram> 06because it got cut out>
<Kipikipo> Mornin'
<Roleplay4life> 05No I think she stabbed it out with a broach.

<Reshiram> 06that was it
<Roleplay4life> 05Yeah. xDD
<Reshiram> 06yeah kipi, nice time to join lmao

<Reshiram> 06ugh yes
<Roleplay4life> 05I actually kind of liked that one.
<Reshiram> 06hated that just as much
<Reshiram> 06but then again
<Twilight> 14http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q7Cy3qSwKI&feature=related <--- Just as good as Bananaphone! XD
<Reshiram> 06I read that one in my most screwed up HS year ever
<Reshiram> 06when I had 3 english teachers in one year
<Roleplay4life> 05D:
<Roleplay4life> 05Oh man!
<Reshiram> 06one for first semester
<Reshiram> 06transferred when he left the school
<Reshiram> 06so our whole class got transferred into another teacher's class
<Roleplay4life> 05Was it your Sophomore year?
<Spyrorocks> you guys wouldnt believe the misinformation thats been going around... my cousin told me last night that she wanted an iphone 4 because it was totally solar powered.
<Reshiram> 06and then she got arrested on campus for being drunk (and we did absolutely NOTHING in that class, literally)
<Roleplay4life> 05Wow.
<Reshiram> 06and then the week before she got arrested, I got transferred to the hardest english teacher on campus
<Reshiram> 06but got an A because I literally learned nothing that year but it was unfair to make me repeat it LOL
<Reshiram> 06RP, yeah soph year
<Roleplay4life> 05Well at least you got that.
<Roleplay4life> 05I got a C in AP Lang. and Comp. GRRR.
<May|iScrib> Roara, funny, I learned the same thing in history like I did last year
<Roleplay4life> 05But it was so hard. ;;
<Reshiram> 06I pulled an A in that one too
<May|iScrib> Arizona is higher up in history
<Reshiram> 06it was ALLLLLLLLL essays
<Roleplay4life> 05But I was so close to that B mraaah.
<Reshiram> 06except for latin root bases
<Reshiram> 06but I was pretty good with those
<May|iScrib> !espeon
<Roleplay4life> 05I got an A on every essay but the tests KILLED ME. Darn my test anxiety. xP
*Espeon now belongs to May|iScrib for 6 minutes
<TheDarkness> May: thats so ironic you say that XD
<Roleplay4life> 05Hi Espeon. ^___^

<May|iScrib> Roara, you should put on gloves or something
<May|iScrib> even rubber ones
<RP4L|Oekaki> 05I'll be kindaidle.
<May|iScrib> it helps sometimes =D
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Ugh, it's not connecting me
<May|iScrib> me neither
<May|iScrib> iScrib fails now
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02fff
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Yes
<TheDarkness> this sounds so jazz
<RP4L|Oekaki> 05JAZZ!
<RP4L|Oekaki> 05 /cue Frank Sinatra
<RP4L|Oekaki> 05 /nerd
<May|iScrib> he's danish lol
<May|iScrib> I'm part danish
*TheDarkness dies
<RP4L|Oekaki> 05xD;
<RP4L|Oekaki> 05Is it like slang or something?
*RP4L|Oekaki knows NOTHING
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I'm part Growlithe
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I mean
<TheDarkness> No XD
<TheDarkness> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHf9BJdgdBo&feature=related
<RP4L|Oekaki> 05Ooooooh.
<TheDarkness> this sounds very from the jazz era, the 60s :O
<TheDarkness> though its from the 60s
<TheDarkness> so it makes complete sense :D
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02If it's not working May, why not use the Oekaki?
<RP4L|Oekaki> 05Aaaactually the jazz era was more a little earlier than the sixties so... Eheh...
<TheDarkness> for America :P
<RP4L|Oekaki> 05It was REALLY big in the fifties here.
<RP4L|Oekaki> 05And the twenties of course. ;3
<May|iScrib> 50s = golden age
<TheDarkness> for whom? XD
<May|iScrib> back then, people were having fun
<RP4L|Oekaki> 05The good days of Sinatra, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis... ah... I miss when musicians actually knew how to play instruments...
<May|iScrib> I love fifties diners
<RP4L|Oekaki> 05Modern Rock bands = No talent. xP
<RP4L|Oekaki> 05It makes me sad.
<TheDarkness> RP: and the 20s were semi good for us XD
<May|iScrib> lies
<TheDarkness> not so much poland though
<May|iScrib> Muse = EPIC
<May|iScrib> english bands are the best
<TheDarkness> muse=fail
<RP4L|Oekaki> 05Percussion especially. Modern drummers think that banging around equals music. There's no art to it anymore. ;;
<TheDarkness> I can find better music from a 1970 rock band
<May|iScrib> bah
<May|iScrib> I love Muse
<RP4L|Oekaki> 05@Darkness :: Like RUSH!? :D
<TheDarkness> Maybe, but I dont like them either XD
<RP4L|Oekaki> 05I love Rush so much. They're all kinda old but NEIL PERT. HE IS GOD. <3
*RP4L|Oekaki is going to see them in concert in August with her dad~
<TheDarkness> the temptation of a joke is so huge XD
<TheDarkness> but I'll resist it o3o;
<RP4L|Oekaki> 05xP
*Espeon floofs
<May|iScrib> iscrib fails now
<TheDarkness> "HEY HEy daddy look over there! ITS GOD!" "wut"
<May|iScrib> it refuses to let me draw

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Espeon :O
*Shiny-Growlithe wanted to say something to you but forgot
<RP4L|Oekaki> 05xD He's like the best living drummer in the nation, maybe the continent.
<TheDarkness> Espeon has a beard?
<Espeon> lol wut
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02floofbeard lol
<TheDarkness> RP which contient?
<Espeon> that's more Shiny styly

<RP4L|Oekaki> 05North America?
<May|iScrib> I think the server crashed owO
<TheDarkness> *cough*inantarticamaybe*cough*
<TheDarkness> lies
<TheDarkness> well half lies
<RP4L|Oekaki> 05Since they're liike.. from Canada I think.
<RP4L|Oekaki> 05Name a more talented band here Darkness. --;
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02It might have May, if it did they'll probably try to get it back as soon as they can
<TheDarkness> they must sing the ROYAL canadian kilted yaksman anthem then :3
<TheDarkness> hmm...the air
<May|iScrib> big name
<RP4L|Oekaki> 05Name someone else who sings, plays bass, and plays the keyboard with his FEET better.
<TheDarkness> thats the most talented one I hear XD
<RP4L|Oekaki> 05Darkness, why do you hate them so much!?
<RP4L|Oekaki> 05The talent stares you in the face!
<TheDarkness> Its more like I dont like the dying age of rock, and disney is killing rock for me
<TheDarkness> really?
<TheDarkness> where?
<TheDarkness> for I see my computer and it doesnt look talented ;P
<May|iScrib> Disney is a joke!
<May|iScrib> you shouldn't let that stop you
<TheDarkness> Its been a joke for the...past 50 years?
<May|iScrib> I just put them in the category of money making idiots
<RP4L|Oekaki> 05Disney has made some good things. Like movies.
<TheDarkness> name one
<RP4L|Oekaki> 05They just destroy the music biz.
<TheDarkness> that isnt bambi
<May|iScrib> classic Disney = <3
<RP4L|Oekaki> 05Uh, "Lion King"?
<Twilight> 14Argh
<May|iScrib> Yeah
<TheDarkness> thats been turned into trilogy DX
<May|iScrib> Lion King has my love all the time
<RP4L|Oekaki> 05I mean the original.
<May|iScrib> the first one though
*Twilight needs human drawing lessons >.<
<RP4L|Oekaki> 05The sequels don't count.
<TheDarkness> or...idk whats the peusdo word for trilogy?
<May|iScrib> originals are always the best
<RP4L|Oekaki> 05@Twilight :: What are you having trouble with?
*RP4L|Oekaki draws humans all the time. ^^
<TheDarkness> I have the lion king but I dont call it a great movie anymore
<Twilight> 14I think I'm okay with the eyes and hair, just everything else XD
<Kyu> 07o3o
<TheDarkness> I call it an entertainment movie
<TheDarkness> with sad parts
<RP4L|Oekaki> 05Okay, then, what's YOUR idea of good?
<May|iScrib> is there anything you like?
<Twilight> 14Me?
*May|iScrib twitches
<Reshiram> 06CURSE THIS BLASTED NEEDLE
*Reshiram should just wear bandaids
<RP4L|Oekaki> 05That last message of mine was to Darkness.
<May|iScrib> no, I meant Darkness too
<RP4L|Oekaki> 05o-o
<May|iScrib> not bad of an idea, Roara
<TheDarkness> something like Flying of the Cranes or Come and See. With some actual meaning and reason, along with other countless movies they've made but I can't name all the ones since I can barely find some
<May|iScrib> I used that to prevent my skins peeling off in my dress shoes >>
<Reshiram> 06The ony finger that hasn't been stabbed yet is my left pinky
<TheDarkness> that was to RP and May XD
<Reshiram> 06but watch me stab it in a few minutes ._.
*Shiny-Growlithe looks at the clock
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Aaand GO!
<RP4L|Oekaki> 05Geez, Darkness. You seem kinda picky about your movies.
*May|iScrib shoots iscrib
<TheDarkness> ok who bets 5 dollars she'll stab her last salvation finger?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02:O
*TheDarkness dies
<May|iScrib> blasted site
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02It will be up soon, I'm sure
<TheDarkness> RP: I've seen good movies I've seen bad movies, I basically have my reason to be picky with not only hollywood movies but all movies
<May|iScrib> I wonder if it's connection is closed for a lot of people, not just you and I
<May|iScrib> hollywood sucks now
<May|iScrib> it sucks
<May|iScrib> I should know
<Twilight> 14Wait

<May|iScrib> it's down for us
<TheDarkness> May: I know it sucks
<Twilight> 14Lemme try...
<TheDarkness> Flying with the Cranes was a 1950s movie
<RP4L|Oekaki> 05Have you seen Persepolis, Darkness?
<May|iScrib> whoo works!
<TheDarkness> it beats mostly every movie from 2010
<RP4L|Oekaki> 05Or "The Hurricane"?
<TheDarkness> RP: I've been trying to find a different movie, so no
<May|iScrib> Darkness, I live pretty much next door from Hollywood
<TheDarkness> I feel sorry for youi
<May|iScrib> I prefer Broadway
<RP4L|Oekaki> 05"Persepolis" was amazing. Yay for French films. Very powerful.
<Twilight> 14Mind if I join you guys on iScribble? o:

<TheDarkness> though I dont recommend you watch it
<May|iScrib> yup
<RP4L|Oekaki> 05Mrrr. I think Oklahoma is okay. =/
<TheDarkness> mainly because its such a depressing movie
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Told ya they'd fix it May lol
<RP4L|Oekaki> 05But Greenwillow and I Remember Mama are so underrated but very good.
<May|iScrib> MAH IS STILL THERE

<drfsupercenter> 03that's our network hub
<drfsupercenter> 03at work
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Light_Latias> 12hai :3
<humm> humm
<TimeShift> what a mess
<drfsupercenter> 03indeed
<TimeShift> and inefficient,too
<Articuno> 12Looks pretty normal for most network hubs in businesses 
<Light_Lati> 12your hub is from a tub of speghetti?
*Light_Lati flees
*Chimera hugs ^^
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03wait
<Light_Lati> 12*spaghetti
<Chimera> BORED :c
<Andrew> drf: @ that pic http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95SYdjRVCR0
<drfsupercenter> 03how is it inneficient, TimeShift?
*Light_Latias huggles back
<Light_Latias> 12lolz
*Light_Latias bonks Chime lightly with a board o3o
<drfsupercenter> 03http://img715.imageshack.us/img715/5548/20100621095207.jpg <-- and there's a crapload of hard drive
<drfsupercenter> 03s
<Chimera> LOLz
<drfsupercenter> 03every one of those green lights is a hard drive
<Reshiram> 06that's your hub drf?
<Reshiram> 06that's....so small
<TimeShift> the hubs are interconnected with copper cable
<drfsupercenter> 03there's more below it too, it got cut off
<drfsupercenter> 03Reshiram, seriously?
<TimeShift> not via fibre channel
*Chimera rubbs his head TTTT
<Reshiram> 06the first pic
<Reshiram> 06unless I'm thinking of something else
<Light_Latias> 12X3
<Sneas> 03o.o
<Reshiram> 06also Kyu
<Reshiram> 06I don't know if I have any wire around the house
<Kyu> 07o3o
<Reshiram> 06you probably wont have glasses for your plush
<Reshiram> 06as was my original plan
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Ohai LL ^^
<TimeShift> but then again - reminds me of the network rooms we had in my old office
<Kyu> 07o3o;
<Reshiram> 06I'll take a look around
<TimeShift> with one difference: We had 12 rooms looking like that - well, similar at least
<Sneas> 03o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03we have 5 buildings
<drfsupercenter> 03that's one of them.
<drfsupercenter> 03the one I work at
<Chimera> o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03each one has their own server room
<Light_Latias> 12hai LLotS~
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14:3
<TimeShift> inefficient
<drfsupercenter> 03tell them that
<TimeShift> why not ONE tower rack with ESX machines on them?
<drfsupercenter> 03http://img707.imageshack.us/img707/2046/20100621095239.jpg <-- anyway, this is about 1/3 of our Linux cluster
<Sneas> 03o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03that's basically a bunch of quad-core workstations wired together
<drfsupercenter> 03to get well over 100 CPUs
<Light_Lati> 12figures YOU work at a place like THAT drf o3o
*Light_Lati hides
<TimeShift> just 100?
<TimeShift> that's half of a rack
<TimeShift> and lol, what kind of retard puts ordinary workstations into a 19" rack?^^
<drfsupercenter> 03Dunno
<drfsupercenter> 03it's kinda cluttered, yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03well TimeShift, I didn't count
<Light_Lati> 12must...resist...bad joke...
*Light_Lati hides
<drfsupercenter> 03they *told* me it was over 100 CPUs
<drfsupercenter> 03500 is over 100
*drfsupercenter hides
<monobi_> humm
<humm> awaiting commands :{P
<drfsupercenter> 03we have so many comptuers we ran out of space
<drfsupercenter> 03and have them all over the office too
<drfsupercenter> 03though that's part of what I did today
<drfsupercenter> 03is help clean the place up
<drfsupercenter> 03so we can put up more racks
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Andrew> are those just desktop pc cases stood on their sides?
<drfsupercenter> 03Yep.
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03they're Dell OptiPlex workstations
<Andrew> ha
<drfsupercenter> 035400 and 5500
<drfsupercenter> 03there's literally hundreds of those lying around
<Andrew> thought you'd have like blades or something
<drfsupercenter> 03blades?
<Drake> 04hellooooo
<drfsupercenter> 03we also have Dell PowerEdge servers, but those aren't used for the Linux clusters
<TimeShift> http://www.linux-magazin.de/var/linux_magazin/storage/images/media/images/ibm_p510/72940-1-ger-DE/ibm_p510.jpg
<TimeShift> now - THAT'S a server
<Drake> 04Hiya LLOTS
*Drake hugs
<Drake> 04Hiya LL
*Drake also hugs
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah TimeShift, we have something like that
<drfsupercenter> 03I didn't take a picture of it
<TimeShift> we got around 40 of those in one of our datacenters...
<drfsupercenter> 03not quite as tall
<TimeShift> of which we have FOUR :)
<drfsupercenter> 03ours is probably have that size
<drfsupercenter> 03...LOL>
<drfsupercenter> 03well we only have like 350 employees
*Light_Latias huggles back
<drfsupercenter> 03we don't need over 9000 servers
<Light_Latias> 12hai lol
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway, bbl dinner
<TimeShift> you're fine with just one
<Glacymr> 12hmm
<Light_Lati> 12bai drf
*Chimera puts a sign on LL "FREE HUGS"
*Chimera hides
<TimeShift> because those are virtualized systems. One rack can be either one, ten, fifty or one thousand servers - depends on CPU time you need
<Drake> 04lol
*Light_Latias giggles
<Articuno> 12http://havocpigeons.deviantart.com/art/hello-168502020?q=1&qo=1

<Glacymr> 12hmm
<Glacymr> 12dunno
*Light_Latias licks Chime's face "Naughty, am I?"
<Light_Lati> 12just so birdy lovers can enjoy them~
*Chimera purrs "yep |3~"
<Light_Latias> 12I haven't even named the price and you think dirtily o3o
<Chimera> Blush = what then
<Chimera> ;P
<Articuno> 12GRRRR
<TimeShift> because they have odd parallels to Lugia?^^
*Light_Latias reaches down Chime...
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04Herons do...a bit.
<Articuno> 12In the time it took me to open Notepad to write something down so I wouldn't forget.. I forgot ..
<Drake> 04lol

*Light_Latias huggles back
<Drake|School> 04LLOTS, is Saphira finished?
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04what if you delete it by accident?
*LugiaLordOfTheSeas hugs back
<Drake|School> 04...
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Yep
<Drake|School> 04FFF THAT SOUNDED WRONG
<Light_Latias> 12<Cute_Riolu> IT WANTS TO YOU BE A GIRL
<Light_Latias> 12<Cute_Riolu> THAT'S THE COST >wat?
<Chimera> XD
<Drake|School> 04anyway
<Drake|School> 04does that mean you'll be able to work on Cynder LLOTS?
<TimeShift> he takes a screenshot of it and sets it as desktop background?
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14yep

*Light_Latias flees
<Chimera> LOL
<Chimera> My... Uhh...
<Chimera> Hip?
<Articuno> 12But i'd still have to open my browser
*Chimera hides
<Chimera> Or not o3o;
<Light_Latias> 12but it feels like....
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04Random but I learned the other day you're not meant to keep your mobile phone in bed. But it's my alarm clock! So I put it on the floor instead >>
*Chimera flees!
<Light_Latias> 12EWWWW!
<Light_Latias> 12used tissues!
*Light_Latias dies
<Chimera> XD
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14XD
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04I've been doing that since 1999 when I got a mobile so I think it was okay and I got away with it.
<Chimera> HEY I HAD NO TRASH CAN
<Chimera> :U
<Cute_Riolu> EAT IT THEN
<TimeShift> you take your mobile phone with you to bed?
<Chimera> no
<Chimera> D:
<TimeShift> were pillows out of stock?^^
<Light_Latias> 12._.
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04Yeah so I can use it as an alarm. My dog steals regular alarm clocks and takes the batteries out.
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04Oh well.
<Light_Lati> 12wb drf
<TimeShift> if he likes batteries that much, I'll bring a car battery for him next time I get over :P
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04wb
<drfsupercenter> 03thanks
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04hehe
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<TimeShift> lots of volts to chew on
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04well I've had to force open his jaws a few times to take batteries out of his mouth.
<drfsupercenter> 03I use my phone as an alarm clock too
<drfsupercenter> 03just put it next to me o.
<drfsupercenter> 03*o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03I have a little table next to my bed
<TimeShift> did he maybe see the Duracell-Bunny-commercials a few times too often?
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04I can't do that because my dog is a thief, he's had my phone, shoes, DS, everything, and runs round the garden with them.
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04Hehe maybe.
*Articuno snugs RN
<Armageddon> :O
<Articuno> 12I am going to sleeps in a sec
<TimeShift> do with him what I did with my parrot: Bite him once ;)
<Light_Lati> 12night Arti~
*Light_Lati huggles
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04He even took my camera the day after I bought it and I found it in the garden unchewed.
<Altair> night Arti

<Light_Latias> 12you missed it o3o
*Light_Latias hides
<Reshiram> 06Kyu, you make a pudgy plush :>
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04Haha can't do that, I'd injure him xD
<Armageddon> what
<Chimera> XD

<Chimera> :o
<Armageddon> don't, please
<Reshiram> 06^sounds like me
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04That's what everyone tells me to do but I won't
<Chimera> K xD
<Armageddon> I'm using CGI:IRC
<Chimera> Arma
<Armageddon> it's going to lag like <censored>
<Reshiram> 06I did that to my dog whenever she bit me
<Chimera> Where am I nommed
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04He doesn't respond to water or shouting
<Reshiram> 06it actually worked
*Chimera shot
<Reshiram> 06it's a dominace display
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03I usually just start yelling at my doig
<drfsupercenter> 03*dog
<Reshiram> 06^that works too
<TimeShift> you know - there's a very simple way to get him stop chewing on things :)
<drfsupercenter> 03it really doesn't
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04Have his teeth removed? LOL
<Armageddon> fff LL
<drfsupercenter> 03my dog's 8, she still tries to kill me
<Reshiram> 06drf, how old-
<Reshiram> 06oj
<Reshiram> 06oh
<Glacymr> 12o-o
<Armageddon> god damn it
<Armageddon> o.o
<TimeShift> all you need is a battery, a capacitor and some copper wire
<EpicStatsGuy> 4,1BEHOLD THE POWER MORE EPIC THAN UR MOM
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14wft
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14lol
<Reshiram> 06older dogs are harder to put in place
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04I'm not gonna electrocute my dog :P hehe
<Light_Latias> 12wb o3o
<Armageddon> o.o
<Armageddon> wb
<Armageddon> damnit LL
<drfsupercenter> 03you know
<Chimera> Grr
<Armageddon> I told you not to post logs
<drfsupercenter> 03everybody misuses the word electrocute
<Glacymr> 12all you need
<Chimera> !setgreet Meow~
<drfsupercenter> 03that word means to be KILLED by electricity
<Armageddon> it's lagging like <censored>
<Glacymr> 12to do is shave them
<drfsupercenter> 03if you just get shocked
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not electrocution
<Glacymr> 12then they behave 8D
<drfsupercenter> 03it's just being shocked
<Light_Latias> 12I didn't see it until AFTEr I did ._.
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04lol shave them
<Light_Latias> 12sorry
<TimeShift> capacitor is charged by battery, capacitor is connected to copper wire, dog bites the wire or touches it with his wet mouth, capacitor discharges on his tongue
<Armageddon> .-.
<TimeShift> bet 20.000 volts don't taste THAT delicious
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04I wouldn't be comfortable with doing that to my dog, hehe
*Sneas leaves. lol.
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04but thanks
<Armageddon> D:
<Light_Lati> 12o.o
<Armageddon> bai Sneas D:
*Armageddon snugs
<drfsupercenter> 0320,000? Woah
<drfsupercenter> 03THAT'S OVER 9000
<drfsupercenter> 03but really, how does that not kill them?
<Reshiram> 06LOL
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04It might cause him to have a fit - Jack Russells are prone to fits
<Articuno> 12LMFAO
<Glacymr> 12TimeShift said 20.000
<TimeShift> well, it's not worse than a short sting of a nail
<Articuno> 12Well night all ^^
<Glacymr> 12not 20,000
<Chimera> Cya Sneasle
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04yeah that's European
<drfsupercenter> 03why the .000 then?
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04Night
<drfsupercenter> 03why not just 20?
<Glacymr> 12TimeShift was tricking you?
*Glacymr hides
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o?
<TimeShift> twenty thousand
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04On mainland Europe they say 20.000 instead of 20,000
<drfsupercenter> 03that's what I thought.
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04and they say 1,0% instead of 1.0%
<Articuno> 12NIGHT XD
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04NIGHT
<Reshiram> 06DAY
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14AFTERNOON
<Glacymr> 12who wants to win 1.000.000 dollars
<drfsupercenter> 03Glacymr, that doesn't work
<Light_Lati> 12lolz
<drfsupercenter> 03you can't have two decimals
<prince-dari> They say 1,0%? Wth.
<drfsupercenter> 03in a number
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Glacymr> 12i know
<TimeShift> yep, we do
<Glacymr> 12it makes the gameshow sound stupid
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04I meant 1,2%
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04I am bad at maths :P
<TimeShift> and it's more natural in fact
<Light_Lati> 12lol RN
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04something like that lol
<May|iScrib> oh gosh
<Armageddon> >:
<TimeShift> a , splits sentences, right?
*Light_Lati nods
<May|iScrib> scribbling grass all over the place hurts the hand
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04I'm going to
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04bed*
<Light_Lati> 12night RN~
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04Night night!
<Glacymr> 12i find it hard to believe a battery can produce 20,000 volts
<prince-dari> If you're using it in that context, then it'd be 1, 2%, not 1,2%.
<drfsupercenter> 03you need a transformers
<TimeShift> of course
<drfsupercenter> 03-s
<drfsupercenter> 03I prefer Optimus myself
*drfsupercenter hides
<Glacymr> 12i mean most electric fense thingies are only capable of 10,000 volts
<TimeShift> I didn't say anything about the ampere used by the charge
<TimeShift> voltage is one thing, current the other
<TimeShift> that's why I said you'd need a capacitor
<Glacymr> 12a capacitor only stores a charge
<Glacymr> 12it doesn't amplify it
<TimeShift> this one would be charged by just a VERY LOW amount of amperage, but convert it into a HIGH amount of voltage
<TimeShift> depends on what kind you take
<WetBunnyfox> !lag
<Altair> [WetBunnyfox] Lag with nest.lugia.us is 1.358secs
<TimeShift> remember the camera flashes?
<TimeShift> same function
<Azure> 12o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03TimeShift, I once got shocked by a camera flash capacitor and had a burn on my finger for a good 2 weeks
<drfsupercenter> 03when I was taking apart a disposable camera
<drfsupercenter> 03a single AA did ALL THAT damager
<drfsupercenter> 03-r
<prince-dari> Were you trying to make a taser?
<drfsupercenter> 03No LOL
<Glacymr> 12nah
<drfsupercenter> 03I just took it apart to see how a camera worked
<Light_Lati> 12o.o
<Glacymr> 12he was making his own youtube show
<drfsupercenter> 03and touched the little shiny thing
<Glacymr> 12"how to hurt yourself"
<drfsupercenter> 03and ZAP
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL No
<Glacymr> 12fine
<Light_Lati> 12typical w/e
<Glacymr> 12"funny ways to be an emo"
*Light_Lati flees
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL what
<drfsupercenter> 03taking apart a camera is typical? What?
<Light_Lati> 12nvm
<TimeShift> well, if you want to have a fancy shock, open a television (one of the older one's) whilst on full energy and touch one of the capacitors
<drfsupercenter> 03I didn't WANT to get hurt ><
<TimeShift> you'll be hit by around 500,000 volts then
<drfsupercenter> 03I just didn't know better
<prince-dari> Lol, a 'fancy shock'.
<TimeShift> a friend of mine did it once by mistake, trying to fix a computer
<prince-dari> Well, I bet they never did it again - lesson learned. XD
<TimeShift> he was catapulted around five meters cross the entire room, crushing his couch and a table
<drfsupercenter> 03WTF
<TimeShift> what do you expect?
<drfsupercenter> 03and what does fixing a computer have to do with taking apart a TV
<TimeShift> depends on what you try to fix on your computer

<Aicebololololo> what?
<drfsupercenter> 03thanks
<Ryft> Have you ever listened to Alexisonfire?
<Aicebololololo> yeah
<Ryft> :D
<Aicebololololo> they were in town a couple months ago playing next door to me vs myself
<Ryft> Isn't that guy's voice amazing?
<Stormy> Is that "Alex is on fire" or "Alexis on fire"?
<Aicebololololo> I watched for a bit but it wasn't too intense since I was in the back
<Ryft> Stormy: good question
<Aicebololololo> and I downloaded their new CD and I listened to it once but I was busy doing something and wasn't paying that much attention...
<Ryft> I don't believe they've ever said how it's pronounced
<Aicebololololo> I'll have to listen to it again when I'm in a hardcore mood
<Ryft> Their newest is Crisis, yes?
<Aicebololololo> ummm idk the one with the bird on it
<Ryft> Hmm
<Aicebololololo> that's what the one guy said was newest he could be wrong
<Ryft> That might be Old Crows/Young Cardinals
<Ryft> I'm not sure which is their newest
<Ryft> xD
<Aicebololololo> yeah that is the one
<Ryft> I like Crisis the best, though
<Aicebololololo> I'll listen to it when I get the chance
<Aicebololololo> hmm
<Ryft> Awesome :3
<Aicebololololo> do you like of mice and men
<Aicebololololo> i've been debating whether or not to get their new one is it good
<Lambda> no, they scream too much
<Lambda> :P
<Aicebololololo> lambda lol
<Stormy> Of Mice and Men is a band?
<Lambda> yeah
<Lambda> the book I like
<Aicebololololo> yes
<Stormy> o.O
<Lambda> but the band is too screamo-ish
<Aicebololololo> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzft8E-RMIY
<Aicebololololo> yeah I dont think you'll be that into it stormy lol
<Lambda> they did a poker face cover
<Lambda> XD
<Stormy> "Poker face cover"?
<Aicebololololo> there are way too many screamo covers of pop songs, it isn't funny any more it's just getting old

*Aicebololololo was forced to make a mep part to a rock version of "milkshake" today and is so sick of the cover of it
<Lambda> cover means another band does the same song
<Stormy> O_o
<Aicebololololo> silly stormy
*WetBunnyfox sits on Glacymr
<Stormy> How did this comment ever get 72 thumbs up?
<Stormy> all you mother [censored]ers quit your god [censored] [censored]in you mother [censored]in [censored]er [censored]s.

<Aicebololololo> ...LOL
<Stormy> The highest rated comment
<Stormy> on the Poker Face video
<Aicebololololo> for the humor of it probably
<Lambda> LOL
<Stormy> On a side note, that song scares me
<Lambda> that band scares me
<Aicebololololo> ryft I really enjoyed a city and colour cd I know it's one of the dudes from alexisonfire
<Ryft> :3
<Aicebololololo> lambda and stormy it's good once in a while but idk how it ends up being the only type that people listen to
<Aicebololololo> right now i've been on a 90s emo kick hahahahahah
<Lambda> good 90s emo song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FV-HPOHu8mY
<Aicebololololo> i have that album actually it's great
*WetBunnyfox mixes it with lambchops to make a health potion
<Aicebololololo> GIVE YAH THIS SADNESS, WAAAAH OHHH OHHH OHHH OHHHHHHH~
<Aicebololololo> do you have the whole album Lambda
*TheDarkness eats it with its serpeant head o3o
<Aicebololololo> if you dont you need to get it
<Lambda> no I don't
<Lambda> what is the album called?
<Aicebololololo> Bleed American
<Aicebololololo> it's got trophies on the cover
<Lambda> I find it hard to beleive that band is considered emo
<Lambda> most of their music seems happy
<Aicebololololo> because it's real emo, people these days think that hawthorne heights and stuff is emo when it's not
<Aicebololololo> it's hard to explain what the real definition is of it but I know it when I hear it
<Stormy> blarg
<Aicebololololo> real emo is like cap'n jazz, promise ring, sunny day real estate, american football etc
<Lambda> blarg?
<Aicebololololo> really good bands

<Arti|mobile> ra
<drf|work> hi
<Arti|mobile> lol hi
<Arti|mobile> planet51 is kinda lame
<drf|work> you also at work?
<Arti|mobile> yep
<drf|work> OF COURSE IT'S LAME
<drf|work> I see any animated movie these days that isn't Pixar and expect it to suck
<Arti|mobile> you seen it?
<drf|work> and usually I'm right
<drf|work> :D
<drf|work> nope, but it's animated and not Pixar, therefore suck
<drf|work> :P
<drf|work> it's flawless logic, really
<drf|work> haven't seen an exception except HTTYD
<Arti|mobile> yeh true
<Arti|mobile> httyd was amazing
<drf|work> rather than going "THIS LOOKS GOOD" and "THAT LOOKS GOOD", I just think it's gonna suk
<drf|work> *suck
<drf|work> like that guardians of w/e movie with the talking owls
<drf|work> WTF is that cra
<drf|work> p
<drf|work> it's gonna suck
<drf|work> :)
<Arti|mobile> have you heard the voices?? LOOOL
<drf|work> yeah, they're stupid
<drf|work> but I know some people on TST are all "The movie woulda been good if not for the vocies"
<Arti|mobile> I'm gonna watch it anyway because I wnt to see if its better than average
<drf|work> NO, absolutely not, it's about talking owls, it SUCKS
<drf|work> I'm sorry XD
<drf|work> but seriously
<drf|work> it's animated and it's not by Pixar, it sucks
<drf|work> end of story
<drf|work> :D
<Arti|mobile> its not about talking owls lol
<drf|work> yes it is
<Arti|mobile> riight
<drf|work> all the characters are fricking owls
<drf|work> and they talk
<drf|work> so talking owls
<Arti|mobile> and lion king is about talking lions
<drf|work> yes it is
*drf|work hides
<drf|work> Lion King is more or less Hamlet with less incest
<drf|work> :P
<Arti|mobile> drf you are utterly stupid
<drf|work> why, just because I don't like stupid animal movies?
<Arti|mobile> no
<Arti|mobile> because you're narrow minded
<Arti|mobile> matrix is about talking people
<drf|work> no, I just expect movies to have something more than just an average plotline
<drf|work> LOL
<drf|work> but seriously
<drf|work> the majority of movies these days suck, which is why the good ones are *good*
<Arti|mobile> yeh ok but you can't just see a trailer and say oh that's about a cat and nothing else
<drf|work> I didn't say it's about nothing else
<drf|work> I just saw it and was like WTF talking owls
<Arti|mobile> you did
<drf|work> OK you know what, nvm LOL
<Arti|mobile> you said its about talking owls
<drf|work> It might not be *about* talking owls
<drf|work> but it still has them
<drf|work> :)
<Arti|mobile> implying thats the plot
<Arti|mobile> lol
<Arti|mobile> yes
<drf|work> no, I'm just saying it HAS talking owls
<drf|work> nvm
<drf|work> you misinterpreted me
<drf|work> or maybe I mis-spoke
<drf|work> w/e
<Arti|mobile> and it looks stupid but the animation is awesome
<Arti|mobile> and I'm gonna watch it to see what the plot actually is
<drf|work> the animation is good yes but good animation with a crappy story is still crap
<drf|work> I'm just not, it looks like another dumb kids' movie
<drf|work> the fact that they only show the preview before kids movies kinda proves it LOL
<drf|work> well, Toy Story 3 is more than just a kids movie but it's rated G so they threw it in there
<Arti|mobile> ?
<Arti|mobile> what?
<drf|work> Like
<Arti|mobile> they do what?
<drf|work> in America, they show trailers before movies primarily based on ratings
<drf|work> if the movie's rated G, they show you trailers for G and PG movies
<drf|work> if it's R, they show you previews for PG-13 and R
<drf|work> etc
<drf|work> they won't show trailers for PG-13 movies in front of G rated movies
<Arti|mobile> I get it
<drf|work> so there were only so many they could show before TS3 XD
<Arti|mobile> LOL
<Arti|mobile> I can't wait to see ts3
<drf|work> yeah
<drf|work> it's really good
<drf|work> I'm gonna see it a second time XD
<Arti|mobile> LOL I saw httyd twice
<Arti|mobile> once ib 3d
<Arti|mobile> which was way better
<drf|work> I saw TS3 in 3D
<drf|work> but I wanna see it in IMAX
<Arti|mobile> imax 3D
<Arti|mobile> ?
<drf|work> Yes.
<drf|work> I just saw it in normal 3D LOL
<Arti|mobile> not like red and blue....?
<Arti|mobile> what's normal 3D then?
<Arti|mobile> switch those two sentences around
<Arti|mobile> it'll make more sense lol

<Articuno> 12We are now using litespeed technology to make websites allot faster however this has caused a issue with some sites not being able to connect to MySQL, litespeed should of been a none downtime update. We are investigating this and expect to have a fix within a hour.

<Twilight> 14O.o
<Quanyails> 7Hey, Arti. :3
<Quanyails> 7Leaving in two days.
<Quanyails> 7Hope you can get that contest done in my possible absence.
<Articuno> 12I was thinking that
<Articuno> 12and you can sort out the prize after you return
<Quanyails> 7Okay. :D
<Articuno> 12^^
<TimeShift> someone should tell them NOT to test such things on LIVE SYSTEMS
<Articuno> 12Lol
<Articuno> 12Find me a better host
<Twilight> 14http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uHcEidRRiY&feature=related <--- <3
<Articuno> 12Because I have to pay 230 on July 3rd if not
<TimeShift> I have one. Downside: He costs about the double amount
<TimeShift> but this one has decent SLAs
<drfsupercenter> 03Jeez, my stupid router
<TimeShift> !define SLA
<[TST]Bot> -!- service level agreement; stereolithography apparatus; specific leaf area; Sudan Liberation Army, also known as SLM; sealed lead-acid battery; second language acquisition
<TimeShift> the first one
<Articuno> 12LMAO
<Articuno> 12I'd rather not pay double the amount :3
<Articuno> 12I'd just like a standard host that has decent database connectivity
<drfsupercenter> 03http://img692.imageshack.us/img692/4184/dsc01580zq.jpg <- my work clothes
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<drfsupercenter> 03it's "business casual'
<Articuno> 12LOL
<Articuno> 12Cool :3
<drfsupercenter> 03I think I don't look as overweight with dress clothes
<drfsupercenter> 03though they're not that comfortable >_>
<Articuno> 12Yeh I hate wearing work clothes, I like how they look on me but they're uncomfortable
<TimeShift> you get what you pay for
<Articuno> 12I'm sorry but I've never heard of anyone pay such high prices for standard shared hosting
<drfsupercenter> 03what's this about?
<Articuno> 12Hosting
<drfsupercenter> 03which host
<Articuno> 12Mine
<TimeShift> who said "standard shared hosting"?
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean, TimeShift is telling you about another place?
<Articuno> 12Thats just it, I want standard shared hosting
<Articuno> 12I just need a decent host
<drfsupercenter> 03Dreamhost for $8 a year?
*drfsupercenter hides
<Articuno> 12You KNOW that sucks
<drfsupercenter> 03no it doesn't
<drfsupercenter> 03I've never had any problems with it
<Articuno> 12....
<Articuno> 12OMG
<Articuno> 12SERIOUSLY
<Articuno> 12HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION DRF???
<Articuno> 12YOU'RE JUST SOOOO STUPID D:
<TimeShift> drf....can you imagine what SIZE TST is atm?
<Articuno> 12GET OUT OF MY SIGHT XD
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<WetBunnyfox> I'ma go now
<WetBunnyfox> Buh bye
<drfsupercenter> 03TimeShift, I have oh, a few movie ISOs on mine, probably about 100GB total?
<drfsupercenter> 03on my Dreamhost?
<drfsupercenter> 03still works fine
<Articuno> 12YOU IDIOT
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't use *databases* but yeah
<Articuno> 12HOW MANY TIMES
<Articuno> 12THERE
<drfsupercenter> 03Articuno, I SHOWED you a database
<Articuno> 12THATS THE PROBLEM
<drfsupercenter> 03that was hosted by them
<drfsupercenter> 03and you said it worked fine
<Articuno> 12Where?
<drfsupercenter> 03until I told you who hosted it
<TimeShift> and what does it have in common with DATABASE ACCESS?
<drfsupercenter> 03...
<drfsupercenter> 03that blindsniper site, I'd ahve to get the link again
<TimeShift> typical american stubbornness...
<drfsupercenter> 03but he hosted it on DreamHost VPS and it worked fine
<TimeShift> example?
<Articuno> 12....
<drfsupercenter> 03how am I stubborn? I'm just pointing out that cheap stuff can be good
<drfsupercenter> 03ever heard of eBay?
<TimeShift> if europeans are talking about a 3-litre-car, they mean a car only needing 3 liters per 100 kilometers...
<TimeShift> if an AMERICAN talks about a 3-litre-car, he talks about a car having ONLY a 3 litres big engine
<drfsupercenter> 03I never use the term "3 liter car" so what's the point?
<drfsupercenter> 03I use the term 'car"
*drfsupercenter runs
<drfsupercenter> 03I could give a crap about that, honestly, if it has 4 wheels and gets me from place A to place B safely it's fine
<TimeShift> and requires the amount of fuel of an average development country's day-production
<TimeShift> just to drive out of your garage
<Articuno> 12Im sorry but I just don't believe that a server with unlimited EVERYTHING can ever run a database correctly
<Articuno> 12For 8.95 a month
<drfsupercenter> 03I paid $9 for a full YEAR
*drfsupercenter runs
<drfsupercenter> 03but then after that it's like $7 a month
<drfsupercenter> 03it was a promo XD
<drfsupercenter> 03first year for $9
<drfsupercenter> 03and unlike PowWeb they didn't bug me about piracy
<drfsupercenter> 03they just let me put whatever I want on it
<TimeShift> all-american quality products
<drfsupercenter> 03what?
<TimeShift> like General Motors or Chrysler, eh? ;)
<drfsupercenter> 03I like my mom's Honda
<drfsupercenter> 03which is actually America
<drfsupercenter> 03n
<drfsupercenter> 03they're made in Alabama
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't care where their CEO lives :P
<TimeShift> what? You drive an non-american car?
<TimeShift> you communist :P
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03Hondas are made in the USA
<TimeShift> ...and hamburgers grow on trees...yeah, yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03what
<TimeShift> of course they are...if that info calms the masses ;)
<drfsupercenter> 03No I'm serious
<drfsupercenter> 03Honda has plants in America
<TimeShift> so you usually are not serious?
<drfsupercenter> 03their *headquarters* is in Japan, but that means nothing
<drfsupercenter> 03and for that matter, most "American" cars like FOrd and wahtever actually just make all their parts in Asia
<TimeShift> I knew it all time long
<drfsupercenter> 03because it's cheaper
<drfsupercenter> 03I hate those people who try to make me feel bad for not driving one of the "big 3"
<drfsupercenter> 03I honestly don't care... Hondas are in some ways more American than the American cars
<Articuno> 12So where's this site that runs a mysql database on Dreamhost?
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm trying to find it in my logs
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't have it memorized -_-
<Articuno> 12I think I might just leave this till next year considering the host gave me a free 10GB for being a long term customer
<drfsupercenter> 0310GB is like, tiny
<drfsupercenter> 3Total Free: 4070.50 GB/8333.29 GB
<Articuno> 12It is if you pay $8 a month for a crappy host
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03haven't I suggested OVH already?
<Articuno> 12I got 40GB with Powweb..
<drfsupercenter> 03I got unlimited with PoWeb...
<drfsupercenter> 03*PowWeb
<Airwolve> I think it's more like
<drfsupercenter> 03stupid 150MB text files
<Airwolve> "unlimited!*"
<drfsupercenter> 03it's like "We don't keep track but if you start putting 50 gajillion DVDs on there we'll suspend you'
<Articuno> 12Havent I told you I wont setup all the server tools and need to have them ready for me to use?
<drfsupercenter> 03that's why you have someone do it for you
<Articuno> 12Are you offering???
<Airwolve> so, why exactly do Microsoft claim Games for Windows LIVE requires the HTTP, HTTPS, and DNS ports forwarded?
<Airwolve> as well as some others which we've just got it working without?
<Articuno> 12Wtf
<Articuno> 12As in the games like minesweeper etc?
<Articuno> 12*Multiplayer minesweeper
<drfsupercenter> 03sorry, phone
<drfsupercenter> 03Articuno, I could install MySQL, from what I hear it's easy LOL
<Airwolve> note the LIVE, it's the XBox LIVE service spread to windoze
<drfsupercenter> 03but I mean, the reseller can also do it
<Articuno> 12That part is Easy, what about Cpanel etc. ?
<drfsupercenter> 03you just have to ask them o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03...
<drfsupercenter> 03it's called ssh
<Airwolve> though WLM -does- use the same account
<drfsupercenter> 03learn to use Linux you noob
*drfsupercenter hides
<Articuno> 12Um no
<Articuno> 12I don't have time or patience for it
<Articuno> 12I barely have time for TST
<drfsupercenter> 03well then that's your problem
<Articuno> 12No it isn't a problem
<drfsupercenter> 03oh really now
<drfsupercenter> 03PowWeb didn't have cpanel either -__
<Articuno> 12Yes, because most decent hosts have this stuff setup already
<drfsupercenter> 03*-_-
<drfsupercenter> 03it has its own proprietary thing
<drfsupercenter> 03you're thinking *web* hosting, not *server* hoisting
<drfsupercenter> 03*hosting
<Articuno> 12No but Powweb had their own alternative and it was actually GOOD
<drfsupercenter> 03you need a server for TST
<drfsupercenter> 03not just "Oh, here's my personal website"
<drfsupercenter> 03that's why
<Articuno> 12Wtf? I just want what I have now but CHEAPER
<Articuno> 12I don't want the hassle of controlling a server
<Articuno> 12i want it done FOR me
<drfsupercenter> 03oh that's great
<drfsupercenter> 03they removed the forum
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03the one on DreamHost
<drfsupercenter> 03the guy who made it took it down
<drfsupercenter> 03I think he was just testing it
<drfsupercenter> 03well basically, a dedicated server is like "Here's your login, do whatever you want"
<drfsupercenter> 03and you can do whatever you want
<Articuno> 12I don't want any of the hassle
<drfsupercenter> 03shared hosting is meh, it has more problems since it's *shared*
<drfsupercenter> 03um
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm quite certain you can install cpanel on a dedi
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Gonna go
<Articuno> 12Yeh but I dont want the hassle
<drfsupercenter> 03It's a one time setup...
<drfsupercenter> 03that's like saying installing Windows is too much of a hassle for you
<drfsupercenter> 03that's stupid
<Articuno> 12It is hassle
<Articuno> 12But I NEED that
<Articuno> 12I DONT need a dedicated server
<drfsupercenter> 03fine, then let TST go down every 2 seconds, I don't care
<TimeShift> drf...what about updates on Linux machines, eh?
<drfsupercenter> 03I've offered to help plenty of times >_>
<drfsupercenter> 03...
<Articuno> 12I am managing fine with this one, I dont care that it goes down once every few months but I care that I pay a lot
<TimeShift> they need to be patched like any other server
<drfsupercenter> 03why would you need to update a linux machine?
<drfsupercenter> 03You can run like, Ubuntu 8.04 and be fine
<Articuno> 12DRF TST USED to go down every 2 seconds on Powweb which you seem to think is absolutely great, shows how much you know.
<drfsupercenter> 03for that matter I'm still using 9.04
<drfsupercenter> 03I never saw it go down at all on PowWeb
<drfsupercenter> 03but that one time
<Articuno> 12Thats because you never went on the site
<drfsupercenter> 03when they accidentally pulled their hosting offline for a day or whatever
<drfsupercenter> 03orly
<Articuno> 12Yes rly
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd go on the forums every once in a while
<drfsupercenter> 03just as I do noqw
<drfsupercenter> 03*now
<Articuno> 12Yeh and back then it used to take over 20 seconds to load
<drfsupercenter> 03I just don't go on the *main* site because there's like nothing there
<TimeShift> because the services can be exploited easily?
<drfsupercenter> 03for you maybe
<TimeShift> it happened on TST already
<drfsupercenter> 03Linux can be exploited? That's news to me
<Articuno> 12Nothing there but all the work I've put in and all the pages I've typed up
<Articuno> 12and DRF, it used to be slow for EVERYONE.
<TimeShift> we all know you're quite out-of-date
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03TimeShift, YOU DON'T NEED TO BE UP TO DATE TO BE SAFE FFS
<drfsupercenter> 03My workstation at work is a computer from 2003 with XP, works faster than most *new* machines
<TimeShift> of course you need
<drfsupercenter> 03more than half of software "updates" do absolutely nothing
<drfsupercenter> 03are you telling me that I need to update my Wii to menu 4.3?
<drfsupercenter> 03all that update did was disable homebrew
<Articuno> 12DRF it's not a matter of all or nothing you know
<drfsupercenter> 03it does absolutely
<drfsupercenter> 03same thing goes with like, iTunes
<drfsupercenter> 03and any other multimedia programs
<TimeShift> drf, you're a dumbnut and will obviously NEVER be able to leave that status
<drfsupercenter> 03the new ones don't really do anything but "fix" the "problems", thus being things that are actually useful
<prince-dari> Lol, drama.
<drfsupercenter> 03like removing DRM from the files
<Articuno> 12TimeShift DRF isn't worth arguing with really, he thinks Powweb is a good host and that there's nothing on TST's main site.
<drfsupercenter> 03I said there's nothing NEW on there
<TimeShift> he's a retard
<drfsupercenter> 03I've seen all the good stuff XD
<Drake> 04hellooooo
<Articuno> 12Oh come on we all know that already
<drfsupercenter> 03>_>
<Articuno> 12He argues about things that he doesn't even know about
<drfsupercenter> 03orly?
<drfsupercenter> 03how do I not know about software updates
<Articuno> 12Like a while back he tried to argue that people couldn't understand how an animal is feeling.
<Lyon> 04hellooo
<drfsupercenter> 03Articuno, w/e, I don't remember that
<drfsupercenter> 03but when it comes to computers I actually *do* know what I'm talking about
<junh1024-XDCC> Articuno: try http://www.lunarpages.com/basic-hosting/
<Articuno> 12Why do you think Powweb is a good host and that TST ran fine on it then?
<Lyon> 04Articuno
<Articuno> 12Looked at Lunar pages already
<Lyon> 04is TST down or something?
<Articuno> 12Same stuff, powweb clone
<drfsupercenter> 03I never said it was a good host for TST
<drfsupercenter> 03I said it was a good host for ME
<Articuno> 12I will look at their more expensive stuff
<Articuno> 12and no DRF, you actually said it ran fine on Powweb
<drfsupercenter> 03but it went down less with PowWeb from what I could tell
<Articuno> 12No it didn't XD
<drfsupercenter> 03It did
<TimeShift> you're on your very first job in a small backyard-fiddle-crap-company and are trying to prove people being wrong who studied computer sciences and computer forensic
<Articuno> 12See?
<drfsupercenter> 03it might have been slow
<drfsupercenter> 03but it was acdtually *there*
<TimeShift> that's not just dumb, that's insulting
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd rather have slow than *NOT THERE*
<Articuno> 12No
<Articuno> 12You're stupid I'm sorry but you are
<drfsupercenter> 03sigh, if you're gonna go this route... maybe TST just doesn't run on anything and THAT'S your problem
<Lyon> 04ooooook I think I'll just go
*Lyon poofs
<Articuno> 12Since when doesn't it run on my current host? XD
<drfsupercenter> 03you're basically saying there's no server in the world that can handle it
<drfsupercenter> 03since it GOES DOWN ALL THE TIME?
<Articuno> 12I said it runs fine now, I just want to pay less
<Quanyails> 7LYON
<Quanyails> 7D:
<Articuno> 12and when did it last go down?
<Lyon> 04QUAN
*Lyon hugs
<Quanyails> 7Hey.
<drfsupercenter> 03Articuno, this morning>?
<Articuno> 12Um yeh? Thats the same issue that we're having NOW
<Lyon> 04How are you?
<Articuno> 12Thats ONE ISSUE
<drfsupercenter> 03I know it is
<Quanyails> 7Oh, look, Kel-Al Relish Jr. on AQ.
<TimeShift> drf, you're as smart as 15 yards of country road
<Articuno> 12and that is happening on the whole host, NOT JUST TST
<Lyon> 04ohgod
<drfsupercenter> 03I remember it's gone down like 4 times in the past year
<Articuno> 12See? XD
<Lyon> 04he's is a nightmare
<Articuno> 12OH WOW
<Articuno> 12FOUR TIMES
<drfsupercenter> 03My server's never gone down
<drfsupercenter> 03at all
<drfsupercenter> 03neither has bayleef, our OVH host
<Articuno> 12with powweb I got the "Unable to connect to database" every single week
<Quanyails> 7You're gonna need a high-melee defense armor for him.
<Articuno> 12More than once a week
<drfsupercenter> 03well it went down once when some moron rebooted it LOL
<Articuno> 12Fyi the static pages on TST still work
<Articuno> 12http://www.lugia.us/chatstats/silverwings.html
<TimeShift> do I really need to explain you what the difference between static files and dynamic databases and contents is?
<drfsupercenter> 03no
<Articuno> 12TimeShift yes LOL he doesn't get it
<drfsupercenter> 03I know what databases are
<drfsupercenter> 03all I'm saying is if your host is so great, why do you keep complaining about them?
<Articuno> 12Oh god >v< It's 11pm
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm trying to help, forget I even mentioned PowWeb >_>
<Articuno> 12I complain that I pay so much for them
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm just saying it would work sooo much better on a dedicated server, you just have to set it up once and you'd be fine
<Articuno> 12I never said it was perfect either
<Articuno> 12Yes Ok so who's offering to set it all up for me then?
<drfsupercenter> 03The reseller probably can
<Lyon> 04btw Quan
<drfsupercenter> 03I linked you to one a while ago
<drfsupercenter> 03OVH reseller
<Quanyails> 7Mmm?
<drfsupercenter> 03if not I could probably do it if you gave me the login -_-
<Articuno> 12I couldn't find any info in English about their hosting
<drfsupercenter> 03installing MySQL is like
<drfsupercenter> 03installing any other program on Linux
<Lyon> 04are you just entering the contest with that sprite
<drfsupercenter> 03you just download the source, build it, and install it
<Lyon> 04?*
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not really that hard once you've done it
<drfsupercenter> 03I could do it >_>
<Articuno> 12Do it then!
<Articuno> 12and Cpanel while you're at it
<Quanyails> 7I suppose. o3o
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd be willing to...
<Lyon> 04well...
<Articuno> 12and find me all the specs for the dedicated server on OVH in English
<drfsupercenter> 03well I gotta look up cpanel
<Articuno> 12and then I'll consider
<Quanyails> 7If it doesn't qualify, ignore it.
<drfsupercenter> 03ovh.co.uk
*drfsupercenter runs
<Lyon> 04You're not gonna score well because the contest is mainly judged on accuracy'
<Quanyails> 7Mmm'kay.
<Articuno> 12WTF + Prices
<Articuno> 12*@
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah nvm that
<drfsupercenter> 03Kimsufi is what you want
<drfsupercenter> 03http://www.kimsufi.co.uk/
<Articuno> 12So all this time you recommended OVH and didn't even look at the price -v- lol and then you wonder whjy I don't take your advise.
<drfsupercenter> 0315 a month gives you 250GB hard drive
<Articuno> 12*advice
<drfsupercenter> 03No no
<drfsupercenter> 03Kimsufi is an OVH reseller
<Articuno> 12Thats more than I pay now and thats WAY too much
<Articuno> 12Ok, but still too much
<TimeShift> it's NOT about the DISK SIZE!
<Articuno> 12TST is only about 5-6GB at the mo
<Articuno> 12LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03TimeShift, I never said it was
<TimeShift> yes you did
<drfsupercenter> 03but YOU were the one who was all "Do you have any idea how much SPACE it takes up?"
<drfsupercenter> 035-6GB is nothing
<TimeShift> all the time
<drfsupercenter> 03most hosts will give you at LEAST 10./..
<drfsupercenter> 03also
<Articuno> 12I have 20 at the momen
<drfsupercenter> 03<usotsuki> we have mysql on Bayleef <-- that's the OVH server we use
<Articuno> 12t
<Articuno> 12Oh finally a solid answer DRF
<drfsupercenter> 03I TOLD YOU YOU COULD DO IT
<drfsupercenter> 03We just INSTALLED It
<TimeShift> and how much data traffic and cpu time?
<drfsupercenter> 03but
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm asking uso if you can temporarily host TST on there and see if it works
<Articuno> 12No I wanted to know if it actually ran properly or not
<Articuno> 12Hmm
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah it runs
<drfsupercenter> 03we have a forum
<drfsupercenter> 03apparently XD
<drfsupercenter> 03I never knew we did
<Articuno> 12So.. wtf is Bayleef anyway?
<TimeShift> how many MB/s database query, eh?
<drfsupercenter> 03http://forum.hoshinet.org/
<drfsupercenter> 03there you go
<TimeShift> that's the ONLY thing relevant
<drfsupercenter> 03Articuno, bayleef is what we named our server XD
<drfsupercenter> 03it's like asking what Cube is
<drfsupercenter> 03we just called it bayleef
<Articuno> 12Right and your server is being provided by......?
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway http://forum.hoshinet.org/ <-- that's hosted on OVH
<drfsupercenter> 03OVH...
<Articuno> 12OVH directly or a reseller?
<drfsupercenter> 03directly
<Articuno> 12How much?
<Articuno> 12Per month
<drfsupercenter> 03a ton LOL
<Articuno> 12:/
<drfsupercenter> 03then again
<drfsupercenter> 03we have like 4TB of disk space, a 2.somethingGHz Core 2 Duo, etc
<drfsupercenter> 03that's complete overkill for a fourm XD
<drfsupercenter> 03*forum
<Articuno> 12I'd rather have TST go down 4 times a year than pay more than 230
<drfsupercenter> 03we use it for lots more than that
<Articuno> 12o_______O
<EpicStatsGuy> Murrrnapples :3
<Articuno> 12So anyway..
<drfsupercenter> 03heck, our drives keep filling up -__
<drfsupercenter> 03*-_-
<drfsupercenter> 03Articuno, anyway, an OVH reseller would be just as good as the normal
<drfsupercenter> 03all they do is just sell you an account XD
<Articuno> 12Yeh, but I'd need a good price too
<drfsupercenter> 03I swear I found one that was less
<drfsupercenter> 03as you said it was better than what you paid
<drfsupercenter> 03not sure where it was
<Articuno> 12Find it again and email me or something with details
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway look at that forum I pasted you, that's hosted on there
<Articuno> 12I see
<Articuno> 12It's fine
<drfsupercenter> 03k
<Articuno> 12I like the sound of OVH
<drfsupercenter> 03OVH is like the biggest provider in Europe
<Articuno> 12I just want it somewhat cheaper or maybe the same price as current
<drfsupercenter> 03when it comes to dedicated server
<drfsupercenter> 03s
<drfsupercenter> 03the one I showed you was a "shared dedicated"
<drfsupercenter> 03as in they basically just let a bunch of people use one
<Articuno> 12Anyway I REALLY need to go now
<drfsupercenter> 03OK
<Articuno> 12It's 11pm O____o
<Articuno> 12I have work and I still have to clean up
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03cya then
<drfsupercenter> 03I'll look around for you
<drfsupercenter> 03bbl dinner

<Quanyails> 7It borked, in a nutshell.
<Lyon> 04oh

<TimeShift> the host messed up a technical configuration. Therefore all your browser receives atm. is just a mess of trash data

<TimeShift> !define LPAR
<[TST]Bot> -!- In computing, a logical partition, commonly called an LPAR, is a subset of computer's hardware resources, virtualized as a separate computer. In effect, a physical machine can be partitioned into multiple LPARs, each housing a separate operating system.
*Lyon|Away poofs
<TimeShift> whew, that's just partly correct to be honest :P
<Quanyails> 7Goodbye.
<Aicebo> Stormy|Work I know your thereeeee rawr

<Princess-Dairy> How big?
<TimeShift> an LPAR is not just a logical partition, but even an entire independent, logically separate system on one AIX-machine. And there can be up to 40-50 LPARs on one physical machine
<Aicebo> idk like 300 mb it has like 4 albums in it
<Princess-Dairy> Only 300MB? :P
<Aicebo> waiting for it to download before I go looking for more
<TimeShift> depends on how much CPU or memory you need
<Aicebo> it's taking a long time is my point dude :P
<Princess-Dairy> Biggest download I've seen i 70 GB. XD
<Princess-Dairy> is*
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Darnit missed Azure D:

<Princess-Dairy> Ooh, it works.
<Theguesst> Unless I get the giratina, and this giratina has a 1/401 chance of being obatined counting all of my options, the team will be incomplete
<Theguesst> So yeah, the game hates me
<Roleplay4life> 5Gosh. Tough luck.
<Roleplay4life> 5(Like ninety percent of that went over my head. I feel so illiterate.)
<Theguesst> All you need to know is because of this little mistake, it will take another 2 months to get this team working
<Roleplay4life> 5O-oh. Now I see.
<Roleplay4life> 5Yeah that really sucks. x__x
<Theguesst> And the worst part is that everything else is set to go except this minor detail of a pokemon.

<Guesst|TBBstream> just away
<drfsupercenter> 03wtf is TBB
<Guesst|TBBstream> It's a webstream
<drfsupercenter> 03what's TBB?
<Growlithe> d
<Guesst|TBBstream> the internet sensation that made those mario paint videos on youtube
<Guesst|TBBstream> he is
<drfsupercenter> 03According to Nintendo, playing Mario Paint with an emulator to record videos is piracy, you know
*drfsupercenter hides
<Guesst|TBBstream> He plays it with a SNES
<Light_Lati> 12lolz
<Guesst|TBBstream> and records it with a video capture device
<drfsupercenter> 03that's still copyright infringement
<Guesst|TBBstream> no
<drfsupercenter> 03because the copyrights say you're not allowed to share any game content over the internet
<drfsupercenter> 03so by uploading them to YouTube you're breaking the law
<drfsupercenter> 03have a nice day :P)
<drfsupercenter> 03*:)
*drfsupercenter hides
<Guesst|TBBstream> Well then the whole world is breaking a law
<Guesst|TBBstream> and news flash
<drfsupercenter> 03Which is precisely my point.
<drfsupercenter> 03which is why I think your arguement is tupid.
<drfsupercenter> 03*stupid
<Guesst|TBBstream> if's illegal to use google if you're under 18
<Guesst|TBBstream> it's
<drfsupercenter> 2,3[ I am 19.253141 years old ]
<drfsupercenter> 03and?
<Guesst|TBBstream> yeah
<Guesst|TBBstream> everyone does
<drfsupercenter> 03YouTube even SAYS "NOTHING THAT ISN'T MADE BY YOU CAN BE UPLOADED"
<drfsupercenter> 03just because people do
<drfsupercenter> 03doesn't mean it's OK
<Guesst|TBBstream> so the world is breaking the law
<drfsupercenter> 03*I* don't care
<Light_Lati> 12lol
<drfsupercenter> 03but I just hate how you're trying to be a goodie two-shoes here
<Light_Lati> 12I don't think ANYONE cares lol
<drfsupercenter> 03just admit that copyright laws are stupid and I'll let you off the hook
<Guesst|TBBstream> Well it's captured from your tv
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Light_Lati> 12<late>
<drfsupercenter> 03not...really
<drfsupercenter> 03you plug it into something like a DVD recorder

<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<Princess-Dairy> Unfortunately?

<Guesst|TBBstream> so this is nothing to me
<InfamousZed> i got other obligations to work with as opposed to a beucoup amount of free time

<Aristeo> mkay
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14:\
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14bloody youtube
<Skylands> 10it sucks, I had 842 subscribers
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14D:
<prince-dari> Suspended for what?
<Skylands> 10I'll never achieve that again
<Skylands> 10copyrighted songs, what else? @Presea
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14loltabfail
<prince-dari> ^Aww, beat me.
<Skylands> 10that's how most people get deleted nowdays -v-

<prince-dari> I didn't realise they banned accounts for that. :o
<Skylands> 10Apparently so
*Skylands sighs
<Aeroslash> hai
<RoarART> 06no not really, but still reeking of awesome
<RoarART> 06hi
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14They've always banned accounts for copyright
<Skylands> 10it's quite silly, you'd think they would actually WANT the songs to stay on there
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Well
<Skylands> 10that way more people learn about the song/artist
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14^
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I find it funny though
<Sneas> 03Copyright laws/lawmakers = stupid and idiots
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Youtube gets ridiculed by copyright, but things like lastfm, internet radio channels stuff like that don't
<prince-dari> I think it's more the money-hungry record companies that enforce copyrights, rather than the artists themselves.
<Skylands> 10Yeh
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I don't think any of the artists really care
<Sneas> 03Capitalism :3
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14xD
<Skylands> 10They'll keep doing this until it's too l;ate
<Skylands> 10late*
<Skylands> 10by then everyone will be gone
<Chimera> Meow
<Sneas> 03Bark
<Skylands> 10the only people that will stick around are paying to keep their accounts lolol
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14The day I actually buy a CD is the day I can't physically download anything
<prince-dari> I suppose youtube is more in the spotlight, because it's very well known.
<Sneas> 03I only buy stuff I support
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14last fm is more popular than youtube tbh XD
<Sneas> 03Such as games
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Games I buy
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14unless they are old and impossible to find
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Emulators ftw
<Sneas> 03I could have just downloaded all my DS games on my flashcart but I buy them bucause I support them :3
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I'd rather download them, but that's me
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14:P
<Sneas> 03Yeah, old games = torrents to me :3

<drf|work> not sure why you're not seeing that LOL
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Well
<Kyro|PlayingSanAndreas> 04a lot of thing XD
<Kyro|PlayingSanAndreas> 04things*
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14drugs and crime <<< fun? no
<Skylands> 10lol
<Kyro|PlayingSanAndreas> 04crime and drugs yes...when u its just a game, its very fun
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Stupid? yes
<Light_Lati> 12bai~
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Even for a game it's stupid XD
<drf|work> bbl lunch
<Espeon> oh
<Espeon> lol
<Skylands> 10^
<Kyro|PlayingSanAndreas> 04lol i just hurry up and beat the game, then get free roam and use Spawn vehicle cheats
<Kyro|PlayingSanAndreas> 04xD
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Even that is boring on GTA LOL
<Kyro|PlayingSanAndreas> 04nuu
<Espeon> http://i50.tinypic.com/2iw6rn4.png this is what I'm seeing
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I think the only fun thing is making your character jump off stupidly high buildings to see if he lives or not
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14The rest is just pointless and senseless violence lol
<Kyro|PlayingSanAndreas> 04meh, w.e., im just trying to get a 100% complete game
*Espeon randomly rests on Hawkieee
<Skylands> 10that's cuz you're on the forums, Espeon
<Skylands> 10if you do http://www.lugia.us, you'll get the other thing
<Espeon> same thing all over the site
<Kyro|PlayingSanAndreas> 04i find it like a rediculous level of fun, so...thats just me
<Espeon> but whatever xD
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14And I'm saying I can't stand GTA :P
<Espeon> GTA 4 is fun. Physics makes doing stupid stuff far more fun.
<Espeon> to yourself that is
<Kyro|PlayingSanAndreas> 04and last night i just finished like my 14th playthrough of Saints Row 2, XD (love that game with a passion)
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Now, I even found GTA4 boring, it's the same thing lol just with a few new features
<Espeon> Well it obviously is the same thing with a new engine, what I'm saying is that it makes the funny things like jumping off things and glitches even more amusing.
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14lol
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I'll just stick to glitching NFS games :P
<Espeon> lol
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Maybe MoH too
<Espeon> the new MoH honestly looks so horribly unoriginal
<Espeon> just random chain of thoughts xD
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Rising Sun ftw
<Espeon> but then again FPS + Original = TILT
<Espeon> I remember that game xD
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14XD
<Espeon> dc?
<Espeon> oh
<Twilight> 14Bwahaha

<Caaz> I know, so have I. It was just really hard to connect IRC to omegle
<Airwolve> http://xkcd.com/757/
<Caaz> Very good accomplishment
<Caaz> I could try bringing it here.
<prince-dari> Not really, you just use sockets.
<Altair> You can bring it to the server just not this channel lol
<Altair> #4chan or #spam ideal
<Caaz> Alright
<prince-dari> Ooh, spam.
<Espeon> #spam is most ideal
<Caaz> This is how people react
<Caaz> <Caaz> You're tlaking to IRC.
<Caaz> <Omegle> >> Disconnected.
<Caaz> Lets see.
<Caaz> Tada

<prince-dari> That list came from wikipedia, I think.
<TimeShift> for what?
<TimeShift> ahh - question: Is something like a volunteer fire brigade/department known where you live?
<J-Lugia> no idea, why?
<TimeShift> just wondering. They're VERY common all around here
<J-Lugia> and for your previous question, Air horms are awsome. Why wouldn't you want one? XD
<TimeShift> because I don't need one :P
<Espeon> o.o
<Altair> just get the ipod app
<TimeShift> and to answer your question again: Most of those volunteer fire brigades are called via air horn
<Altair> :D
<TimeShift> like this here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5Voi53JHJE
<Aurora> 06sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeena
<SheenaFox> Aurooooooooooooooooooooooooooooora
<Espeon> o3o
<TimeShift> oh and something more: Do your fire departments also welcome every new year in a very special way - like this? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlWtYD0oTnM
<SheenaFox> !espeon
*Espeon now belongs to SheenaFox for 2 minutes
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14fff stupid autoconnect
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14brb again
<Altair> our fire departments are busy with idiots shooting fireworks off in their houses on new years lol
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14That's better
<TimeShift> not a single minute to welcome a new year?
<Aurora> 06<Altair> our fire departments are busy with idiots shooting fireworks off in their houses on new years lol <-this
<TimeShift> xD
<Altair> i'm sure somewhere in there they celebrate... but not much :P
<Aurora> 06but I do run into them at Safeway quite a bit, so they DO have lives
<Aurora> 06I see them there the day before new years...so I guess they party in between idiots
<TimeShift> quite usual, yeah
<TimeShift> our volunteer fire department people have regular jobs and a regular life in fact. They're only firefighters when they need to be
<TimeShift> and for those not having such an air horn - they have small alarm devices NOBODY can ignore :) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKNT7ukNqQo&feature=related
<Aurora> 06that thing is so musical, yet annoying @TimeShift
<TimeShift> well, it's made to wake people up in fact
<Aurora> 06still, it's super musical lol
<Aurora> 06ours are so....simple
<TimeShift> there's an even more evil one - with a high-power light in it to wake you up guaranteed
<TimeShift> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EYdiB6Dw3Y&feature=fvw
<Aurora> 06wow that thing would make me deaf
<Aurora> 06that's way too high pitched o-o;
<TimeShift> at least you're awake then
<Aurora> 06it speaks lol
<TimeShift> it repeats the radio transmission about the emergency call
<TimeShift> in that case "End of test alarm."
<Aurora> 06ugh this class is horrible
<Aurora> 06and I probably shouldn't have taken it..
<Aurora> 06except I need credits
<Aurora> 06....oh well WONDERFUL
<Aurora> 06the oil well got worse apparently
<Aurora> 06the cap was removed
<TimeShift> bleh
<Aurora> 06it'll be put back on, but fdhuhofdgoidrd
<drf|work> sigh, I failed bigtime
<drf|work> ended up hitting a fence with the SUV and broke the mirri
<drf|work> *mirror
<TimeShift> SUV = think slim, drive wide
<drf|work> LOL
<drf|work> well yeah
<drf|work> luckily that's ALL that broke, the thing still drives fine
<drf|work> besides the paint getting a little scratched up, but that's purely cosmetic
<Aurora> 06.....LOL
<Aurora> 06you hit a fence
<drf|work> yes
<drf|work> swerved into it
<Aurora> 06at least it wasn't a Porsche
<drf|work> the official story I'm telling my parents is that I was trying to avoid hitting someone
*drf|work runs
<Aurora> 06liek what I almost did
<Aurora> 06*like
<Aurora> 06and LOL
<drf|work> yeah
<drf|work> that's the thing
<drf|work> I'd rather hit a fence than a car, you know?
<Aurora> 06yup
<drf|work> I actually did rear-end a guy once and made my sister swear to never tell anyone
<Articuno> 12ENGLAND ARE BACK IN WITH A CHANCE XD
<drf|work> as neither one of our vehicles were damaged
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14LOL
<Aurora> 06were you making a turn or something?
<drf|work> so I drove away with nothing but a verbal assault
<Aurora> 06I mean...you just swerved?
<drf|work> me? yeah
<drf|work> oh
<drf|work> well
<drf|work> yes, I was turning at liek 40mph
*drf|work runs
<Aurora> 06...LOL
<drf|work> yeah
<drf|work> probably shoulda hit the brakes a little more
<Aurora> 06that's easy with my small car, but an SUV
<drf|work> but I thoguht it would be fun
<Aurora> 06LOL
<drf|work> that is, until I hit the fence...
<drf|work> anyway
<drf|work> Articuno
<drf|work> found you some hosting stuff
<Aurora> 06at least you didn't flip or something
<TimeShift> reminds me of this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QgWRycd7I&feature=related
<drf|work> OVH has normal webhosting (like, cpanel etc) for like 2 pounds a month
<drf|work> I kid you not
<SheenaFox|Afk> breakfaaast
<drf|work> the only thing is there's a bandwidth limit :/, not sure how much traffic TST uses
<Articuno> 12Over 30GB a month
<Lugianite> 2hm
<drf|work> oh that's fine then
<Lugianite> 2hi Arti
<drf|work> theyg ive you 500GB XD
<Articuno> 12Ovo
<drf|work> and for a little more you get 1TB
<drf|work> lemme get the link for you then :)
<Lugianite> 2TB good
<drf|work> XD
<drf|work> mine has unmetered bandwidth
<Aurora> 06TB good unless we're talking disease
*Aurora runs
<Articuno> 12This sounds too good to be true LOL
<drf|work> http://www.ovh.co.uk/shared_hosting/
<drf|work> look at the Personal hosting
<drf|work> though it says "Personal SQL: 1x25MB"
<drf|work> not sure if that's what you need lots of space for
<Articuno> 12The pro looks better
<drf|work> well whatever suits you XD
<Articuno> 12I also need the email accoutns you see
<drf|work> how much do you currently pay for yours?
<Articuno> 12More than just 10
<Articuno> 12230 a year, so like 12 a month
<Articuno> 12Or so
<drf|work> OK
<TimeShift> and 25 megs of database...lol^^
<drf|work> well for 10 pounds a month
<drf|work> you get unlimited everything
<drf|work> :)
<drf|work> basically
<Articuno> 12Lame.
<Aurora> 06....lol
<drf|work> it's like a shared dedicated server
<drf|work> you get unlimited bandwidth
<drf|work> the space is limited obviously
<drf|work> also 100mbps guaranteed speed
<Articuno> 12Surely I'd be able to install MySQL and have it use the normal disk space
<drf|work> and yes
<TimeShift> look at this here: http://www.hetzner.de/en/
<drf|work> wait
<drf|work> you mean on the shared hosting? Maybe
<Articuno> 12Yes
<Articuno> 12I mean shared
<Aurora> 06from an untrained eye, getting told "unlimited everything" and you responding with "lame".....LOL
<drf|work> oh
<drf|work> You might be able to, I have no experience with MySQL
<Articuno> 12TimeShift I need to guarantee that MYSQL will load quickly on any host you recommend :3
<Articuno> 12I dunno wtf Personal SQL is meant to be XD
<drf|work> and OVH is like the fastest host I know of so yeah
<drf|work> also
<drf|work> lots of their dataservers are in France
<drf|work> so you'd be outside the juristriction of the Digital Copyright Bill or w/e it is
<Articuno> 12LOL yeh :>
<Articuno> 12Also, LUGIA BOARDS IN 10 MINUTES!
<drf|work> I mean, the one we have is in France
<drf|work> there are a few in English but yeah
<drf|work> wait what? o.o
<drf|work> oh
<drf|work> you mean plane
<Aurora> 06speaking of friends on planes :>
<drf|work> I thought you meant lugia boards like forums
<drf|work> nvm
<Articuno> 12LOL
<Aurora> 06....LOL
<drf|work> Snakes on a Plane?
*drf|work runs
<TimeShift> well, Hetzner has one of the biggest and fastest datacenters here
<drf|work> anyway Arti, http://www.ovh.co.uk/products/rps_offers.xml <-- that's the other one
<drf|work> even their cheapest one
<drf|work> would be better than what you ahve SXD
<drf|work> -S
<drf|work> but their shared hosting is more like what you want probably
<Articuno> 12lol
<TimeShift> well, thinking about what size TST grows, maybe we should think about a small own root-server
*drf|work is still a little in shock
<drf|work> what, you mean a dedicated host? :P
*Articuno looks at cheapest one
<TimeShift> we could put IRC onto that server then, too
<drf|work> yep
<drf|work> that's exactly what we do
<drf|work> though the one we have for HoSHiNET is like $150 a month LOL
<drf|work> because we have insane stuff
<Articuno> 12http://www.ovh.co.uk/products/rps1.xml
<drf|work> like 4 1TB hard drives, etc
<Articuno> 12Can't see a problem with that
<drf|work> exactly
<drf|work> that gives you unlimited bandwidth
<drf|work> you can install MySQL on it
<drf|work> if it doesn't already ahve it, I'm not sure
<TimeShift> unlimited bandwidth usually means there's another problem with it
<drf|work> TimeShift, no...
<LLOTS|Away> Just as I have to go, *pokes Azure* XD
<drf|work> not if it's a dedicated server
<Articuno> 12I could replace the nest IRC server with a proper one so I wouldn't have anymore hassle XD
<drf|work> the RPS is just a dedicated server that's shared among a few people
<TimeShift> honestly, I don't trust those "unlimited" offers for entry-prices by experience anymore
<drf|work> which is why it's cheaper
<Azure> 12XD
<Azure> 12Hai
<drf|work> unlimited *Disk space* is kinda bogus yeah
<TimeShift> and THAT's the PROBLEM drf
<drf|work> but unlimited bandwidth really isn't
<TimeShift> a problem I had already with TWO other servers
<drf|work> you had a RPS?
<TimeShift> yeah
<drf|work> hm
<Articuno> 12Yeh but OVH is a good one
<drf|work> well I really don't know, all I know is OVH is one of the best places for that
<LLOTS|Away> Hai, I'll be back in around a couple of hours
<LLOTS|Away> :<
<Articuno> 12From what I hear at least :>
<drf|work> I know like 3 people who have servers there
<drf|work> they've all had like 99.9% uptime
<drf|work> if it ever does go down it comes back about a minute later
<drf|work> our IRC server had an uptime of over a year
<drf|work> before someone at the datacenter accidentally rebooted the machine >_>
<Azure> 12Ok >:
<Articuno> 12LOL
<drf|work> some routine maintinence crap
<drf|work> but yeah
<drf|work> it came back a minute or two later
<drf|work> we were just like "Aw, there goes our 1 year uptime"
<Articuno> 12Well anyway, I need someone to setup Cpanel for me
<drf|work> OK
<drf|work> I probably could, if I find the installer for it XD
<drf|work> I know it exists
<Articuno> 12I'd rather have someone do it professionally, so perhaps that is included in setup fee..
<drf|work> MySQL is easy enough too, we have that set up on our dedicated server
<drf|work> maybe
<drf|work> they waive the setup fee if you pay annually :P
<TimeShift> I'd either choose Hetzner or HostEurope
<drf|work> I've never heard of either
<drf|work> well then again I don't know much about database hosting
<TimeShift> because you're an american
<drf|work> I just stick to cheap ones and they always work fine for me XD
<drf|work> except Cirtex, that place was retarded
<drf|work> first year was fine, then right after I paid for a second year they started having like dialup speeds >_>
<TimeShift> and I would either pich quality
<TimeShift> pick
<Airwolve> ... lolwut?
<drf|work> well
<Articuno> 12TimeShift, England Vs Germany on Sunday :D
<drf|work> the thing with OVH, they're like a professional hosting place, so even their lowest priced one is still good
<drf|work> it's like
<TimeShift> we'll see ;)
<drf|work> Bose products
<drf|work> they're all fairly expensive
<drf|work> but even their cheap stuff is good
<drf|work> I have no reason not to trust them
<TimeShift> if you want quality stuff, look for Teufel
<drf|work> o.o
<drf|work> also Arti yeah, you can host UnrealIRC on a Linux server :)
<Articuno> 12I'm leaning towards OVH simply because I've seen working MYSQL databases on it
<drf|work> LOL these Mibbit faces look so retarded
<TimeShift> or Bang&Olufsen
<Airwolve> In the 1995 WRC, Toyota drivers had been complaining that they found their cars somewhat lacking in the power department. They were disqualified during the 7th event because it was found the team had been using turbochargers.
<Airwolve> How does that add up?
<TimeShift> or harman/kardon
<Articuno> 12ovo
<drf|work> oh, you're talking about speakers
<drf|work> LOL
<drf|work> I never get anything Bose since it's just overpriced
<drf|work> I like Logitech
<drf|work> but that's besides the point
<drf|work> I was just saying that even their cheap stuff is good
<TimeShift> well yeah, but too cheap usually means a lack of performance
<drf|work> Just for fun, I should run speedtest.net on the OVH server
<drf|work> and see what it gets
<drf|work> XD
<Articuno> 129.99 a month isn't THAT cheap though
<Articuno> 12It's reasonable
<TimeShift> a GOOD server requires to be properly priced. Those people don't have anything to donate
<drf|work> yeah
<Articuno> 12It means about 100 less than what Im paying now
<drf|work> LOL, you want expensive TimeShift, you should see the OVH server we use for HoSHiNET
<drf|work> We basiaclly just added everything we possibly could
<drf|work> including 4 hard drives, a dual core CPU, etc etc
<drf|work> I believe it costs like 150 Euros a month
<drf|work> or something crazy
<TimeShift> I have no idea who this HoSHiNET should be, but it sounds retarded
<drf|work> it's a server...
<drf|work> that I'm an admin on
<Articuno> 12Thats less than I pay now LOL!
<TimeShift> well, suits you
<Articuno> 12No wait
<Articuno> 12Sorry
<drf|work> I said a month
<drf|work> not a year
<drf|work> XD
<Articuno> 12I thought you said a year then XD
<drf|work> nope
<Articuno> 12LOOOOL
<drf|work> TimeShift, what?
<drf|work> but the reason we need so much space is that we're an encoding group
<drf|work> we encode like, all the Pokemon movies
<drf|work> TV shows
<drf|work> etc
<drf|work> and store them on there
<TimeShift> I found one here - 2GB Ram, 40GB RAID-1-disk-space, 30 databases, 5GB traffic included, Cron-Jobs, SSH-access, freely defineable A and MX-records - everything managed by their staff
<TimeShift> availability guaranteed 99%
<TimeShift> 25/month
<drf|work> then again don't believe everything that you read :P
<drf|work> I still don't see why you're trying to prove me wrong here
<drf|work> Do you just like disagreeing with me or something? >_>
<drf|work> anyway brb
<TimeShift> let me phrase it this way: Who's the biggest fool? The fool himself or the one following the fool?
<Aurora> 06the village idiot
<drf|work> back
<drf|work> and that's just great
<drf|work> the one guy I need for inventory purposes isn't here
<drf|work> and he took his laptop with him
<drf|work> >_>
<drf|work> hm
<drf|work> I'm gonna attempt to do something crazy
<Articuno> 12What?
<Articuno> 12Hai
<Aurora> 06.....lol
<drf|work> using VNC over a remote access
*drf|work runs
<Articuno> 12LMAO
<drf|work> since I have no VNC client here
<drf|work> and I wanna speedtest bayleef
<drf|work> just for fun
<Kyu> ohai
<drf|work> so I'm gonna remote into my home comptuer and use RealVNC on there
<drf|work> XD
<Kyu> just landed in Phoenix XP
<drf|work> EW IPHONES
*drf|work hides
<Aurora> 06so my mysterygift arrives tomorrow
<Aurora> 06....kyu wtf
<Articuno> 12phone
<TimeShift> if you manage to test your server with a sufficient big database, we can go ahead
<Aurora> 06why phoenix?
<Kyu> now where's Kipi o3o
<Aurora> 06that's a huge detour from WISCONSIN
<drf|work> TimeShift, we *have* one
<TimeShift> because as I said before: All that counts is database throughput
<Kyu> connecting flight
<drf|work> http://forum.hoshinet.org/
<Aurora> 06lol
<TimeShift> how many tables, how many mb of DATABASE size?
<Aurora> 06so, is it hot over there? :>
<drf|work> I have no idea...
<Kyu> LOL Roara
<drf|work> it's not as big as TST but it still works
<TimeShift> Total posts 209  Total topics 133  Total members 198
<Kyu> I'm still in the plane o3o
<Aurora> 06and bring me some cheese after the trip
<Aurora> 06...lol
<Aurora> 06so you literally just landed then
<Kyu> so I dunno the temp
<EpicStatsGuy> Floof has arrived!
<drf|work> there's not an app for that?
<TimeShift> honestly drf? My PHONE could handle a database THAT TINY
*drf|work hides
<Kyu> kbai o3o
<drf|work> eh
<drf|work> I still don't see why you're trying to prove me wrong
<Aurora> 06Kyu, 97 degrees
<Aurora> 06....
<Twilight> 14lol
<Twilight> 14XD
<Caaz> I was too obvious
<Caaz> <Omegle> 18 m us
<Caaz> <MajinMew> 18 f us
<Aurora> 06WELL FINE
<Caaz> <Caaz> 15 f us
<drf|work> XD
<Caaz> <Omegle> >> Disconnected.
<Caaz> >.>
<drf|work> WHAT NINE THOUSAND?
*drf|work runs
<drf|work> </random>
<Aurora> 06lolwut
<drf|work> nothing
<drf|work> anyway bored XD
<TimeShift> TST has around...well....7k users, 40k postings in around 2k topics?
<Aurora> 06xD
<drf|work> just waitng for soemthing
<drf|work> *something
<TimeShift> plus additional databases for THREE galleries, the news, the oekakis, the cms and more?
<drf|work> so what sort of server specs does the current host have?
<drf|work> as I still don't see why that's a problem
<TimeShift> YOU may have around 12 tables with alltogether 2MB of payload - WE have around 400 tables with OVER 300MB of payload in the database
<TimeShift> and everytime the size is doubled, the CPU time you need increases by the factor of 4
<drf|work> sigh
<drf|work> I really don't feel like arguing this with you
<TimeShift> especially with MySQL, which is terribly imperformant with huge databases
<drf|work> like, it's only because I mentioned it that you're fighting
<drf|work> if Articuno found it on your own you probably wouldn't care
<TimeShift> same - I don't like to fight an intellectual battle with unarmed people
<drf|work> I think you just like arguing with me about anything >_>
<TimeShift> honestly?
<drf|work> what
<TimeShift> first: You don't get the relevant point. You're just unable to get it - no matter how anyone tries to explain it to you. Hell, even my cat has more clue of the topic in the meanwhile than you
<Aurora> 06....ok now we're getting a little harsh, guys
<drf|work> Just because I'm not an expert in databases doesn't mean I don't know what a good host is
<TimeShift> second: you stay and INSIST YOUR opinion is the right thing. THE ONE AND ONLY right thing. No matter if others tell you other things
<drf|work> and you're not doing that how?
<TimeShift> no matter if those people are experienced with it
<drf|work> You're trying to insist that the one YOU found is the one and only right thing and that the one I found isn't
<Glacymr> 12heh
<TimeShift> a little difference between us two drf: I have STUDIED the entire thing and AM WORKING in this metier since more than TEN YEARS
<Skylands> 10Drf and TimeShift are fighting, what a suprise >_>
<TimeShift> this gives me EXPERIENCE and throughsight - something you lack
<drf|work> having experience with databases is different than picking webhosts out of a hat
<Quilava> FLAMEWARZbant
<TimeShift> third: I don't want to pick something just "cheap" or "expensive", I want to pick something the right performance for TST because I think the page DESERVES sufficient reserves for the future. It needs a good reliablility, speed and should be able to grow
<Skylands> 10fighting over who has better database experiences.. lol
<drf|work> right, and again, you're just naming random hosts... how is that any different than me recommending OVH?
<drf|work> I know like 3 people personally who have OVh servers and all of them have said it works great
<TimeShift> may I give you an example? I ask for database performance, and YOU come and tell me about harddrives and sizes of them
<drf|work> no, I was pointing that out because some cheap hosting doesn't give you enough hard drive space
<TimeShift> that's like me talking about an oil spill in the oean and you about a leaking can in your refrigerator
*drf|work stabs his router at home for disconnecting so much
<Quilava> well they both kinda suck so yeah
<Aurora> 06holy crap, seriously....this is ridiculous guys
<Glacymr> 12only Articuno can break this up Aurora
<Aurora> 06yeah apparently
<Aurora> 06but still
<Glacymr> 12i know TimeShift and drf way too well
<Skylands> 10yeh well, Aurora's stupid enough to tell them to stop
<TimeShift> and AGAIN you're coming up with hard drive space you prototype of a fool
<Aurora> 06yeah but sitting around watching these two go at it is really sad >_>
<Skylands> 10also points for you, Arcanine
<Skylands> 10[14:03] <%Glacymr> only Articuno can break this up Aurora
<drf|work> You do realize hard drive space isn't all I mentioned
<drf|work> that was like one thing
<drf|work> I also pointed out that the RPS has unmetered bandwitdh (which is a good thing)
<TimeShift> (20:03:18) (drf|work) no, I was pointing that out because some cheap hosting doesn't give you enough hard drive space <-- so, where's the rest?
<drf|work> no, I was saying that's the only reason I mentioned hard drive space
<TimeShift> and STILL not what was asked
<drf|work> because I was telling her that it has enough space to host TST
<drf|work> ...
<drf|work> WHAT exactly was asked then?
<drf|work> Nothing was asked, I was just telling her what I found
<TimeShift> topic missed, F, sit down!
<drf|work> I fail to see why this makes me such a fool
*Quanyails 7blinks at this discussion.
<Aurora> 06ffs TimeShift, I fail to see where anything drf has said BEFORE you started attacking him has caused ANY harm
<Arcanine> 04heh
<drf|work> thank you
<Arcanine> 04i don't even understand why arti keeps TS as an OP
<drf|work> I don't start arguements, really, I'll just defend myself if people start making accusations
<Lyalia> Uh
<TimeShift> what TST needs is CPU performance. That's why Powweb was so damn slow. Because the server was unable to prepare the pages in time
<Arcanine> 04he's caused so much trouble over the most trivial matters
<Lyalia> Then again in TimeShift's defense DRF can be rather dense about silly arguments
<Quilava> ... that's ALL he does
<Lyalia> solution: Just let it pass really
<Arcanine> 04and when he doesn't get his way
<Lyalia> Countering won't lead anywhere because he's just as stubborn as TimeShift is
<Arcanine> 04he takes a long vacation from TST
<Quilava> and I don't understand why she gives half the people op she has
<Aurora> 06TimeShift basically said his cat is smarter than drf >_>
<drf|work> XD
<Skylands> 10^
<TimeShift> 2(Aurora2): Even an ordinary carpet would be smarter in this place
<Aurora> 06while I fully support arguments, I support fair arguments
<Quanyails> 7Wow, across two chats, I spy people arguing about two similar topics.
<Lyalia> Aurora and DRF hasn't sometimes made ridiculous statements of the same quality?
<Aurora> 06...
<Aurora> 06ok why are you an Op then
<drf|work> on a random note
<drf|work> http://img651.imageshack.us/img651/8673/46962646.png
<Skylands> 10she picks the wrong people who can't get along at all
<Aurora> 06you take things so f-ing seriously
<Quilava> or. rather. she needs to rework her system.
<drf|work> That is probably the biggest waste of resources ever but it works :P)
<drf|work> *:)
<Quilava> with more OPs, and lots more halfops
<Quilava> because when <censored> DOES happen, I swear, NOBODY IS <censored> THERE to do anything about it
<Lyalia> Aurora, expertise
<Glacymr> 12Aurora
<Glacymr> 12there is no such thing as a fair argument
<Lyalia> TimeShift has some qualities TST needs
<Lyalia> Articuno realizes this
<Aurora> 06which I don't doubt
<drf|work> I really don't think anybody is perfect P
<Aurora> 06which is why I want this to NOT be so stupidly argued
<drf|work> *:P
<Aurora> 06drf was pointing out his findings
<drf|work> I really don't mind being called stupid, I just hate how TimeShift seems to insult me no matter what I say
<Aurora> 06and apprently that officially means he's FORCING articuno to use it
<Lyalia> Aurora, you've also paid attention to Arti and DRFs banters I'm sure
<Aurora> 06yes I have
<Skylands> 10true
<Espeon> well that's quite true
<TimeShift> because you STILL didn't get the point
<Lyalia> It's similar really
<Lyalia> lol
<drf|work> WHAT POINT? I was just telling her my recommendation!
<Lyalia> I dont know why we're heckling on EITHER because of ... argh XD
<Skylands> 10she complains she can't find anyone that is a "dedicated" Lugia and Articuno fan
<prince-dari> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z4m4lnjxkY&feature=related
<Quilava> ..and then ops <censored> to me that I'm not allowed to tell people they aren't allowed to do something
<prince-dari> This guy scares me.
<Skylands> 10I laugh at that, because there are a few staff there that don't care about that couple at all
<Aurora> 06I do't know why you're trying to let them go on like this...the arguing is over some of the stupidest things
<Lyalia> <drf|work> I really don't mind being called stupid, I just hate how TimeShift seems to insult me no matter what I say <- Mm, that is different then
<Aurora> 06exactly
<Quilava> you mean like all of them?
<Skylands> 10most
<Espeon> also Insults doesn't belong in any arguement...
<TimeShift> and I tell you out of experience: low prices and unlimited traffic have a catch
<Lyalia> Well, Aurora, I'm just regarding this as a similar banter between Arti and DRF
<drf|work> http://www.speedtest.net/result/857146001.png <-- Speedtest results from OVH :D
<Lyalia> Just AS silly
<TimeShift> ...
<Lyalia> Just AS resource wasting
<Lyalia> but it's common as well
<Skylands> 10only people that are dedicated are TimeShift and Aurora (though I hate Aurora's guts)
<TimeShift> still not understanding what I'm saying
<Lyalia> TimeShift, just drop it
<drf|work> I get what you're saying, I just feel like showing that
<Lyalia> DRF is just like that
<drf|work> I'm random, so sue me
*Quanyails 7sits across IRCs while waiting for these situations to simmer down.
<Aurora> 06TimeShift is just like that too, Lyalia
<TimeShift> I would, but as I'm in germany not a single court would accept such a sue here
<Quilava> eh. I thought she was ok
<TimeShift> I'm not in america you know
<Lyalia> I've been here long enough to know, Aurora
<drf|work> LOL
<TimeShift> would be NO PROBLEM there
<Skylands> 10she was, until she was modded
<Quilava> also. she only ops people who are already never freaking around
<Aurora> 06and now we get into who's been here longer...?
<Lyalia> No o.O
<Aurora> 06that's stupider than the argument LOL
<Lyalia> It was a comment XD
<Lyalia> IJSDFHjdfsdsf
<Aurora> 06I'm not saying I know them better than you
<Lyalia> YOU'RE SUCH A FLOOFHEAD.
<Skylands> 10that "I am better than all of you, and will ignore anyone but my circle of friends" attitude showed up shortly after her modship
<Quilava> which adds to the 'nobody's there when you need them' thing
<drf|work> LOL
<Aurora> 06that doesn't change the fact that this is out of hand
<Espeon> where does America/Germany get into this? Where does insults get into this?
<Quilava> all the mods are like that though
<Espeon> Really, it's silly
<Lyalia> O___o
<Lyalia> Espeon is right, I'm rather amused actually
<Skylands> 10Glacymr and LLOTS aren't
<Lyalia> So many random elements
<Skylands> 10Kyu not really either
<Quilava> keep in mind I haven't seen their modlist in like. ages
*Quanyails 7gets a bucket
<Espeon> just like any other arguement on the internet: It escalates in a predictable manner
<Quilava> or it seems that way, at least <.< >.>
<Espeon> I don't mind Aurora
<Espeon> others I mind though
<Lyalia> Espeon: It turns into a liquidy thing of floof
<Lyalia> that in the end nobody can keep track of
<Espeon> in a weird way I guess
<Aurora> 06I just think that bringing in insults to an argument that really shouldn't have existed is stupid
<Quilava> timeshift pissed me off from the moment I saw him.
<Lyalia> Eh, I just take it witha grain of salt. In this case, both factions are as ridiculous as the other
<Lyalia> DRF has been known to say odd things, as has TimeShift
<Dialga> He's also German, but I don't know if he's said that. :V
<Quilava> lol
<Espeon> well from what I see he only pops up when he's about to have an arguement but xD
<Quilava> somehow I think I knew already
<Aurora> 06I haven't seen anything drf has said as wrong (in this particular argument)
<Quilava> its BECAUSE he pops up
<Aurora> 06I know he says stupid things, but still
<Lyalia> Maybe not this time, but in general
<Dialga> sarcasm, he says that all the time
<Lyalia> TimeShift as well
<Espeon> Apart from the insults I can't see any of them saying anything wrong
<Espeon> o.o
<Lyalia> Hm
<Quilava> oh
<TimeShift> still all I want to do is to CARE for TST and the community. And I KNOW what the catch is with too cheap offers combined with "unlimited traffic" and those things. I know it because I tested it myself more than once. With similar sizy communities. And in my business
<Dialga> 4+=1414.11.034=+ <TimeShift> I would, but as I'm in germany not a single court would accept such a sue here
<Quilava> WELL MY POINT IS that I don't have a point
<Aurora> 06that's the thing though, the insults have been somewhat one sided this time around
<Dialga> :V
<Quilava> lawln00b
*Quilava needs to recode his game :(
<drf|work> seriously, all I've done this whole time is defend myself -_-
<Aurora> 06TimeShift, amazingly, MOST of us actually care for this community
<drf|work> I should also leave and go get back to work XD
<TimeShift> so if it's of any aid and money is the only problem that stops us from picking a performant host instead of a cheap one, I'll pay the compensation out of my own pocket
<TimeShift> because I care
<Skylands> 10[14:15] <%Aurora> TimeShift, amazingly, MOST of us actually care for this community
<Skylands> 10haha, lies
<Lyalia> DRF bugger off to work XD It'll all be good in the end~
<Aurora> 06again, others DO care
<Glacymr> 12sometimes more expensive isn't always better
<TimeShift> I don't want to see TST run into such a trap like other pages did
<Quilava> yeah, there isn't a community!
<Quilava> I mean
<Skylands> 10they're never around when we need them
<Glacymr> 12i mean look at apples and other computers
<Dialga> I do, but at the "my friends are there and I doubt I can get them to go elsewhere" level
<drf|work> indeed LOL
<Lyalia> Heh
<Espeon> lol
<Skylands> 10yeh
<Lyalia> TimeShift wasnt saying we should select expensive solutions
<Espeon> I'm really there because I see no reason not to... yet
<Lyalia> He mentioned IF we have to
<Lyalia> He wasn't saying we ARE
<Quilava> mostly its just all noobs now. is kinda why I left to begin with
<Lyalia> O-o
<Glacymr> 12he did state though that cheap hosts have catches
<Glacymr> 12which isn't always true
<Aurora> 06no, but he sure attacked DRF for apparently forcing Arti into his suggestion
<drf|work> no but he seems to be implying that the one I found is "bad"
<drf|work> which is dumb, you can get expensive OVH servers that cost a TON if you want
<drf|work> but it would be complete overkill for what we need
<Lyalia> @ attacking DRF - not acceptable, but I was remarking on the actual thing
<Skylands> 10I don't really understand why I stay around either
<Aurora> 06what actual thing lol
<Dialga> TST has turned into PS to me; a place I really cared about at one time, but then realized core truths about and decided I don't like as much anymore
<Aurora> 06I understand both had their ideas
<Quilava> I used to stay for the few friends who refused to leave.
<Aurora> 06but there are ways of going about how to say that
<Lyalia> the thing which wasn't the attacking of DRF ;p
<Quilava> ..but then it turns out they didn't care all that much, so I just left
<Lyalia> Indeed, but the norm with cheap hosts taint the reputation of those who don't have them @ Glacymr
<Quilava> that or they stopped showing up, etc
<Arcanine> 04keeping peace in that place
<Arcanine> 04is a hard job
<Lyalia> Or so it seems
<Aurora> 06once you start getting aggressive like that, blah
<Espeon> more like impossible
<Arcanine> 04however, there isn't anything i can do in this situation so i'm just sort of staying out of it lol
<Quilava> set mode +b *!*@*, that should quiet things down
<Bloatedfish> lol staff
<drf|work> sigh
<drf|work> I really don't need this right now
<Dialga> /mode #SilverWings +b @
<drf|work> I have work to do LOL
<drf|work> bbl
<Dialga> 8D
<Lyalia> XD
<Espeon> lol
<Arcanine> 04i can't +b other mods Quilava
<Quilava> you need the *'s
<Arcanine> 04well sure i can but they'll just turn them off themselves lol
<Lyalia> I love how he's always so happy.
<Quilava> sure you can. it just won't do anything till they leave the chan
<Dialga> Quilava: automatically becomes *!*@*
<Quilava> oh. sweet
<Arcanine> 04and TS is a freaking admin
<Aurora> 06lol
<Princess-Dairy> /j #lolz
<Dialga> Kind of like how you can ban a nick by just typing the nick and it'll add !*@*
<Lyalia> I actually enjoy the random arguments that occur - though mainly the banters between him and anyone else of his favoured 'I hate apple' topic ^^
<Arcanine> 04he's taken the personal liberty once for Demodding kyu himself for spamming a word
<Lyalia> that one is always interesting
<Princess-Dairy> /mode #lolz +b @
<Espeon> no offense, but if he didn't know Arti as well I bet he would be banned for some sort of offense.
<Quilava> yeah, but he's a prick
<Espeon> :/
<Skylands> 10Hey Glacymr.. do you feel shame that you're a mod on TST (with all the arguements and such)
<Skylands> 10?
<Arcanine> 04i'd hate to see how he reacts if i set a ban on him
<Arcanine> 04XD
<Quilava> psh, it doesn't matter. say you were joking or something
<Espeon> he would probably make a big deal about it.
<Espeon> and him joking? hah
<Arcanine> 04TS has no sense of humor :P
<Espeon> TS that is
<Quilava> he makes a big deal of everything
<Aurora> 06I don't mind arguments, but I prefer not to let them continue if it's going to end up like that
<Arcanine> 04Skylands
<Arcanine> 04i do all that i can
<Quilava> also. if you do ban him for fun. be sure to set the ban to "Timeshift"
<Arcanine> 04therefore i have no shame
<Quilava> that'd piss him off more
<Espeon> Arguements doesn't have insults. At least then all respect for the arguement should vanish magically.
<Dialga> inorite
<Dialga> :V
<Aurora> 06^
<Dialga> s vs. S
<Espeon> LOL
<Dialga> huge difference
<Quilava> that's what he gets for having a capital letter IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS NAME
<Arcanine> 04i try to be understanding
<Dialga> to him, at least
<Brother> Agreed @ Espeon
<Quilava> 4 px is a huge difference?
<Arcanine> 04i try to sit in the other person's shoes and understand their logic and standing on things
<Bloatedfish> i think you're all stupid
<Aurora> 06lol
<Lyalia> Aurora, agreed there, but the trick is that it's nigh impossible to get the parties to disengage once it's begun
<Bloatedfish> teehee
<Lyalia> whiiiich is annoying
<Espeon> How nice
<Arcanine> 04however
<Arcanine> 04i've been accused many times
<Aurora> 06and so I'm just going to sit around and watch it eat up the channel
<Aurora> 06not in my nature
<Arcanine> 04for arguing just for the sake of disagreeing lol
<Lyalia> Wasn't saying that o.O
<Lyalia> Was just saying it could be sort of tricky to go it
<Lyalia> *go about with it
<Lyalia> sdf
<Dialga> aka exactly what TS does?
<Aurora> 06nah, you didn't, but I'm explaining why I tried ending it
<Lyalia> Fair enough ^^
<Espeon> lol I never seriously argue on the internet. It always just comes down to someone throwing the first insult and floof
<Quilava> *everyone
<Dialga> oh yes
<Dialga> everyone
<Dialga> lopl
<Arcanine> 04it's only one person who has accused me of that
<Arcanine> 04but he keeps on accusing me of that on a weekly basis
<Lyalia> [20:21:03] <Bloatedfish> i think you're all stupid <- right back at you LOL
<Aurora> 06now, if this was an actual debate channel, then I'd for sure either get into it (like I did) or sit around
<Quilava> tell them to STFU and ban them
<Aurora> 06but this is main, not a debate channel for stuff like that
<TimeShift> honestly, I have no problem with discussions and arguments, but this was more like a resume of what was discussed yesterday
<Arcanine> 04like i said
<prince-dari> [19:22] <Espeon> lol I never seriously argue on the internet. It always just comes down to someone throwing the first insult and floof Not always.
<Arcanine> 04only Articuno is the only one who can jump in
<Aurora> 06resuming or not, what was said was said
<Arcanine> 04and permanently stop this
<Lyalia> Aurora: Hm one thing that sort of interesting is
<Arcanine> 04then TS will get pissed off
<Aurora> 06insults have no place in it
<Arcanine> 04and leave TST for another 2 months
<Quilava> ... dude. then get him pissed off
<Lyalia> If one topic becomes too dominant in here (bar insults) there is usually attempts to break it up.
<Quilava> him gone = good
<Lyalia> I wonder why, personally
<Arcanine> 04only articuno can piss him off enough though
<Airwolve> http://media.fukung.net/images/17647/8056f425d0d61c1bf26c69b735a46e47.gif
<Quilava> oh. what
<Aurora> 06BLERUERHGUEHGH, for example
<Aurora> 06I know
<Sneas> 03ohgod
<Quilava> wait, the first time it was Sky though
<Arcanine> 04all the times he left was after articuno got involved
<Arcanine> 04nothing else
<Espeon> o.o
<Sneas> 03drama detected.
<Dialga> Anyone else he can just say gtfo b&
<Lyalia> BLERUERHGUEHGH lol I dont know how you can spell that right XD
<Quilava> Sneas, its not drama
<Quilava> we're laughing at people who suck
<Lyalia> I always lose track halfway through
<prince-dari> Sneas: Lawl, e-drama. I don't get involved.
<Aurora> 06magic
<Arcanine> 04i still remember the first time he left
<Lyalia> noes
<Dialga> THAT REMINDS ME
<Aurora> 06no, I have it saved
<Espeon> oh god, people still find that remotely funny? Like even a single microscopic twitch-funny?
<Arcanine> 04he had this little art contest
<Sneas> Still <censored> drama to me. :3
<Aurora> 06I don't feel like memorizing it
<Quilava> wait, YOU PEOPLE CAN REMEMBER? D:
<Aurora> 06espeon, not anymore
<Dialga> oh
<Espeon> good
<Quilava> hax0rz
<Arcanine> 04where people were supposed to search the forums for how TS's character looked
<Espeon> that would be sad
<Dialga> the drawing thing
<Aurora> 06I was pointing it out as one of those huge arguments
<Arcanine> 04and people were supposed to draw him

*Sneas runs
<Arcanine> 04nick made a fantastic drawing but made one mistake
<Lyalia> Should I go get chocolate or not?
<Dialga> Nick made a really good one, but made his name Timeshift
<Lyalia> .-.
<Aurora> 06it's just now has funny
<Lyalia> Mm
<Dialga> :V
<Arcanine> 04he forgot to cap the S in TimeShift
<Aurora> 06..
<Aurora> 06not as
<Dialga> I remember that.
<Quilava> lul
<Aurora> 06wtf >_>
<Lyalia> I'm honestly not too involved here anymore
<Espeon> i remembe- fff
<Lyalia> Most of you probably can tell
<Arcanine> 04so he got pissed off and wouldn't even consider the picture
<Dialga> ninja'd
<Lyalia> I idle a lot heh
<Lyalia> Been sort of seasonal
<Espeon> I bet my script generates more lines than I do myself lol
<Arcanine> 04TS said he would take it back if he redid the picture but it was a pencil drawing so that isn't really easy to do
<Lyalia> Maybes lol
<Espeon> you don't complain about something you get for free
<Quilava> sure you can, you just look like a dick doing so
<prince-dari> Oh, he's from Germany right? Wow, true grammar nazi. :o
<Arcanine> 04eventually we all got on his case and he Nick redid the S, which he won the contest
<Espeon> well true
<Lyalia> honestly though, I have a bit of a problem getting over how much my significant other sometimes dislikes the community. He wants to fit in, but feels such an amount of ... exclusion
<Azure> 12o.o
<Quilava> and lol
<Espeon> dari, that's actually not funny for some reason o.O
<Lyalia> that I myself become withdrawn. Or so it has been, increasingly
<Arcanine> 04then TS left TST for like 5 months lol
<Lyalia> ever since two years ago
*Sneas pokes Azure and stuff like that
*Azure ish poked O:
<Bloatedfish> is this a flashback sequence?
<Quilava> AND THERE WAS MUCH REJOICING
<Lyalia> No.
<Bloatedfish> aw
<Espeon> I never actually noticed
<Quilava> and by that I mean he was missed
<Espeon> until he returned
*Lyalia gives Bloatedfish a flashlight

*Espeon facepalms over it still being there
<Lyalia> there was an earthquake in the ottawa area
<Lyalia> o.o
<Quilava> I'm confused
<Aurora> 06lol that gif, @bf
<Espeon> it's like a trophy over making people mad or something
<Dialga> well it's not there actually
<Espeon> oh
<Espeon> it was like recently
<Arcanine> 04not in the topic
<Espeon> but the BLERwhatever
<Espeon> BLERUERHGUEHGH ?
<Dialga> BLERUERHGUEHGH
<Arcanine> 04well anyway there was this huge spam spree that got on everyone's nerve
<Dialga> lopl
<Espeon> and if that's quoted as my quote in stats I will rage
<Arcanine> 04which resulted in creating this word
<Espeon> well yes it did
<Espeon> it sparked multidrama
<Dialga> stats loploplopl
<Arcanine> 04kyu was legally spamming the word and TS Demodded him for it XD
<Azure> 12Anyways
<Azure> 12raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
<Quilava> wait how can you spam illegally?
*Azure runs
<Arcanine> 04articuno remodded him and TS left in a rageful fury
<Airwolve> http://fukung.net/v/11444/651a6dda69971b535ba410abf98c70e3.jpg
<Espeon> well the only thing that annoyed me was the fact it was actually the mods who spammed the <censored> out of that word while the regular users mostly just sat there xD
<Dialga> I dislike the whole 'you can spam' thing, but that's SW, so yeah :V
<Quilava> that's how it always is :|
<Arcanine> 04i know espeon
<Arcanine> 04Espeon you got to admit though it's funny as hell
<Espeon> No
<Espeon> not at all
<Quilava> I mean. randomly they'll spam about 30 or so pages of text, and expect you to be ok with it
<Arcanine> 04when another mod gets pissed off at another mod for spamming
<Espeon> oh
<Espeon> well THAT is funny
<Arcanine> 04then demods them

<Dialga> I remember on SPP there was this rule 'the ops are always right'
<Dialga> :V
<Arcanine> 04honestly
<Espeon> that is actually hilarious. But I would mentally high-five if TS just stepped in and banned everyone for an hour or something
<Cynder7> 6How are ya?
<Arcanine> 04what's the point of spamming
<Espeon> that would be epic
<Arcanine> 04it doesn't do anything
<Espeon> I dunno, appearently people find it "fun"
<Arcanine> 04it doesn't make any social progress XD
<Quilava> it makes a wall of text
<Espeon> I mean spamming like scripts and such can be "fun" but just goingashduahdoiusajdoisajd
<Espeon> idk
<Espeon> it's stupid
<Arcanine> 04script abuse
<Arcanine> 04isn't equal to spamming in my opinion
<Arcanine> 04depending on the script
<Espeon> that is so silly that it's funny xD

<Dialga> :V
<Espeon> I mean i don't look at being a mod as "fun" xD
<Espeon> but at the same time not as "not fun"
<Espeon> I mean
<Skylands> 10you're a mod here and you seem to have even more fun lol
<Espeon> it shouldn't be about mod
<Espeon> fun*
<Espeon> wtf
<Espeon> xD
<Skylands> 10and true
<Quilava> I just wanted to be a mod so I could actually, you know, be USEFUL.
<Quilava> instead of everyone saying "STFU UR NOT A MOD"
*Curly rolls out of her grave
<Proto> Hey Curly
<Curly> hi Proto :)
<Proto> How's you?
<Airwolve> http://fukung.net/v/18502/atat.gif <-- talk about rule 34
<Skylands> 10or get blamed for "mini modding"
<Quilava> same thing
<Cynder7> 6Nice.I'm fine,thx.
<Quilava> but you know, if the community can't take care of itself, WHY DO YOU EVEN HAVE MODS
<Arcanine> 04if it'll make you feel better Quilava
<Arcanine> 04i can give you an oline on my server lol
<Espeon> lol
<Arcanine> 04even though nothing much ever happens there anymore
<Quilava> but I don't go to your server
<Arcanine> 04heh
<Espeon> really, modding shouldn't be about fun or too much about friendship tbh
<Espeon> lol AT-AT's
<Aurora> 06why did I even bother to look at that
<Espeon> or wwhatever asjd
<Quilava> I like how people say not to mod friends, because you can't judge them accurately, but that's what everyone does.
<Curly> um, wondering who Jeremy Jones is
*Curly eyes the rest of the channel
<Curly> anybody here know a Jeremy Jones? >.>
<Arcanine> 04mainly because people think you can't trust someone who isn't a friend
<Quilava> you should trust them based on how they act, not if you like them
<Arcanine> 04it's a sad corrupt world huh quil?
<Quilava> yes. kinda needs to die
<Skylands> 10Lugianite brought up a good point a few days ago in a convo
<Arcanine> 04you mean like he always does?
<Skylands> 10most of the current staff are Arti's favourites
<Spyrorocks> http://consumerist.com/2010/06/cspi-wants-to-make-your-mcdonalds-happy-meal-sad.html
<Arcanine> 04i guarentee i'm not arti's favorite XD
<Quilava> of course they are
<Skylands> 10it has never been about doing a job on TST
<Espeon> lol well that's obvious
<Arcanine> 04i had to work months just to get her to talk to me casually
<Espeon> as a person and not a member?
<Skylands> 10regardless of who's good and who's bad at the job
<Quilava> I was never good enough for her. so meh.
<Espeon> I know the feel lol
<Arcanine> 04she was willing to sacrifice me
<Arcanine> 04because another mod said they didn't want to work with me
<Arcanine> 04that was such a long dragged out fight
<Arcanine> 04x-x
<Quilava> lol. I remember that
<Arcanine> 04it wasn't funny dude
<prince-dari> Lol, I love how drama has died down over there, but is still being talked about here.
<Arcanine> 04that really did leave a mental scar for a short time
<Espeon> .-.
<Quilava> we're just talking about stuff :|
<Aurora> 06advice to those who aren't in college yet: do not take summer courses x-x
<Arcanine> 04i know
<Arcanine> 04doesn't change the fact how much it hurt though
<Arcanine> 04to be thrown away only because someone says so
<Skylands> 10who said they didn't want to work with you, if I may ask?
<Arcanine> 04i'm keeping that info to myself
<Quilava> I already know who.
<Quilava> they talked to me about it
<Skylands> 10okay
<Arcanine> 04no offense
<Arcanine> 04it's just to protect the situation from flaming out more
<Arcanine> 04or rather again
<Quilava> brbfewd.
<Arcanine> 04kk
<Articuno> 12back

<Aurora> 06I'm suffering through an unhuman amount of work for this class
<prince-dari> Haha.
<drf|work> :()
<drf|work> *:(
<Arcanine> 04i can't remember what you hated so much
<Aurora> 06lolface
<Arcanine> 04that i'd pick on you about
<Arcanine> 04i want to say it was the 360
<drf|work> it's a shame I don't have any blank DVDs
<drf|work> or I could burn this Windows 7 Enterprise disc
<prince-dari> I dunno, maybe that was it, I just couldn't care less now.
<Mail-For_You> Hello.
<Cynder7> 6Nice
<Cynder7> 6Hey
<Arcanine> 04oh well
<Arcanine> 04i agree with you now
<Kjakings> 7hey Malefor
<Arcanine> 04the 360 is fail
<Mail-For_You> Hey ,Kjakings!
<Kjakings> 7you know not coming on with your real name is a bannable offence?
<Soyuz> a personal victim Arcanine? :p
<Arcanine> 04i'm starting to like the wii and the ps3 a lot more
<drf|work> stupid MS Outlook :@
<Arcanine> 04huh Soyuz?
*drf|work stabs it for freezing all the time
<prince-dari> I have to say that Nintendo is definitely the most innovative out of all the companies.
<Mail-For_You> So, Princess-Dairy didn't come on with his real name.
<Soyuz> Arcanine: as in you bought a 360 and suffering its fail?
<Paranoia> this is true
<Kjakings> 7yeah, but the princess is in another chatroom
<Cynder7> 6Wb Icy
<Arcanine> 04nah
<Soyuz> and an upgraded PS3 is somewhat meh, due to the fact that it can no longer play PS2 games
<Cynder7> 6XD
<Arcanine> 04i never got a RROD
<Soyuz> I know, for I have one XD
<Mail-For_You> So.
<Arcanine> 04but it's just not the system for me
<Quilava> doesn't the wii have like, no good games?
<Kjakings> 7oh be ashamed. BE ASHAMED.
<Espeon> I like all the consoles really o.o
<Espeon> Prefer PS3 though
<Kjakings> 7everybody should play super mario bros.
<Arcanine> 04i'm someone
<Arcanine> 04who likes online gaming
<Paranoia> are you the same Malefor that came on a few years ago?
<Kjakings> 7I still play it on my bro's old GBC
<Paranoia> who was 11?
<Cynder7> 6Randomness?
<Soyuz> I prefer the PS3 for having it so long
<Arcanine> 04yet will only play a game like every so often
<Soyuz> but, oh the irony, I like my vista more
<Arcanine> 04a month of membership
<Paranoia> I'm guessing not
<Soyuz> Only because of mods
<Kjakings> 7DDR: you played super mario crossover?
<Arcanine> 04might be spent playing a game like once or twice
<Soyuz> and of PC games
<Mail-For_You> No, I'm 11 right now.
<Aurora> 06you tend to stab everything lol
<Arcanine> 04that's not good use of money
<drf|work> what else would I do?
<Paranoia> Kjakings: what is it called?
<Articuno> 12Ew Outlook
<Brother> well not 'everything' :p
<drf|work> exaactly >_>
<drf|work> but my company uses it
<drf|work> so I ahve no choice
<Kjakings> 7... super mario crossover. google it. it's on newgrounds
<Articuno> 12Same here
<Arcanine> 04now the wii and the ps3 = free internet play
<Kjakings> 7is epic win
<Icydragon> I'm 15 now don't mean I'm any les creepy.
<Paranoia> oh
<drf|work> not to mention it's the 2007 version
<Arcanine> 04so yeah
<drf|work> which just plains ucks
<Kjakings> 7mega man is the best character
<drf|work> *sucks
<prince-dari> Anyone watched E3?
<Paranoia> I'll check it out some time
<Arcanine> 04E3?
<Soyuz> I, did not
<Arcanine> 04oh
<Arcanine> 04no
<Kjakings> 7DO EET NAO
<Soyuz> I was too busy playing with meshes
<Mail-For_You> LOL
<Aurora> 06oh look arti is back
<prince-dari> Haha, I watched Microsoft, Nintendo's, and Sony's.
<Paranoia> I can't chat, play Pokemon, AND play a mario game
<Aurora> 06after a long arguement so conveniently missed :>
<Aurora> 06anyways
<drf|work> XD
<Arcanine> 04funny enough even though the wii has the least good games
<Arcanine> 04i think i like the wii more
<Aurora> 06I've gotten like....a quarter of my work for this week done
<Aurora> 06and I've been at it for 3 hours
<Arcanine> 04only because 360 you have to pay for internet play
<Soyuz> the wii has some good games
<Paranoia> but I shall try anyway
<Soyuz> and some games that arent needed
<Aurora> 06not to mention something I missed last week ._.
<Arcanine> 04and i have had personal bad terms with sony
<Paranoia> XD
<prince-dari> 3DS seems interesting, but it's quite annoying, because you can't really tell what it's like without seeing it in person.
<Aurora> 06and what's horribly sad
<Aurora> 06I think I'm going to get the highest grade in the class by default
<Arcanine> 04like the fact i broke 2 PS2s
<Arcanine> 04by doing nothing
<Aurora> 06because a week later, people are STILL asking stupid questions that basically ensure they've failed the class
<prince-dari> Most people have a wii, if they have any modern console, but people never seem to use them.
<prince-dari> I still have my PS2, and it still works. :)
<Malefor> ???
<drf|work> LOL
<Soyuz> Arcanine: my old old one broke
<Arcanine> 04lol Okami
<Soyuz> the big one
<drf|work> ahahahah some Mac fanboy's gonna love this
<drf|work> "Severe Thunder Storm Warnings for southeastern Michigan. Stay in doors if you can, away from windows."
<Arcanine> 04is a very good reason to have a Wii
<Aurora> 06and yet I STILL have to suffer through this
<drf|work> "But I already DO stay away from Wndows!"
<drf|work> *Windows
<Aurora> 06....LOL
<Soyuz> now I had the small one for a few years :p
*Michel pokes Quilava
*Arcanine lays next to Michel and arfs
<Paranoia> that is annoying how you have to jump with z...
<Malefor> I'm bored.
<prince-dari> PlayStation Move looks quite interesting, but a lot like a black wiimote with a flashing light bobble on top.
<Quilava> yes?
<Malefor> zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.........
<Malefor> JK
<prince-dari> The major thing I like about PS Move is that it has basically a wiimote and nunchuck, expect the two are wireless.
<Dialga> 4+=1415.09.484=+ <prince-dari> PlayStation Move looks quite interesting, but a lot like a black wiimote with a flashing light bobble on top. <-- Sony: ORIGNAL IDEA DO NOT STEAL
<prince-dari> I've always wanted a wireless wiimote/nunchuck setup, wired is too awkward.
<Cynder7> 6o.o
<Malefor> )_(
<Dialga> I like the wired setup.
<prince-dari> But at one point during Microsoft's conference, part of me died inside.
<Kjakings> 7DDR: you can change the controls
<prince-dari> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va-NXzhciVM
<Dialga> To me, a wireless setup would be awkward
<Paranoia> oh nice
<prince-dari> The most awkward thing ever.
<Kjakings> 7ah. pits. my nemesis
<Cynder7> 6o.o
<Malefor> XD
<Dialga> wat
<Dialga> :V
<Espeon> lol wut
<Dialga> microsoft + nintendogs = kinetimals
<Dialga> :V
<prince-dari> The horrible bit is where the kid pretends to actually feel the virtual tiger licking her.
<Espeon> I'd pay to see some more... disturbing applications of that techology
<Espeon> xD
<prince-dari> If she's going to do that, they should have the console spray spit at her.
<prince-dari> "Bye Skittles I love you". My God. *Dies*
<Malefor> :l
<Kjakings> 7ah, warp zones, my good friends
<Malefor> This is boring!
<Quilava> skittles? sounds tasty
<Paranoia> :\
<Cynder7> 6...
<Espeon> dear god that is so
<Espeon> stupid
<Dialga> ogod
<Arcanine> 04skittles
<Icydragon> Yes....
<Arcanine> 04taste the rainbow
<Dialga> http://twitter.com/NMcCoy/status/16832946497
<Articuno> 12*sigh*
<Soyuz> Destroy the rainbow
<Espeon> ffff
<Quilava> rage I can't think ><
<Articuno> 12I just read up all the stuff I missed while I was on the phone -v-
*Quilava stops working
<Brother> that must have been a long phone call
<Articuno> 12Well
<Articuno> 12It started off as a long phone call and then I fell asleep after it as well LOOOOL
<Brother> XD
<prince-dari> Nintendo had it's bad points too, mainly the horrible names that were chosen for their titles.
<prince-dari> "Disney Epic Mickey"
<Brother> So you read the stuff that went on after you were on the phone and had a small nap XD
<prince-dari> "Kirby Epic Yarn"
<Articuno> 12Yeh but it was easier to say the first thing XD
<Brother> indeed
<Aurora> 06fell asleep lmao
<Cynder7> 6Yes what?
<Soyuz> blah disney
<Soyuz> they killed my childhood
<Aurora> 06I slept for 11 hous last night
<Aurora> 06feels SO good
<Articuno> 12I was absolutely shattered
<Articuno> 12Lolz
<Kjakings> 7fucking bullet bills
<Articuno> 12I cant remember the last time I slept THAT long!
<Aurora> 06but waking up was like "heck no, go away sun"
<Kjakings> 7megaman is too tall
<Aurora> 06my record is 15 hours
<prince-dari> Oh, Microsoft stole some stuff from Nintendo too, there was Kinect Sports.
<Articuno> 12Hmm lets see
<Aurora> 06that was after a new years "stay-uo-for-50-hours" thing
<Articuno> 12Mine is 19 hours D: jetlag after America
<Aurora> 06*up
<Arcanine> 04nintendo
<Articuno> 12I went to bed at 9pm when i got home and then woke up at 4pm the next day, which was California waking up time (8am)
<Arcanine> 04is going to be a really rich company me thinks
<Articuno> 12My clock was entirely screwed
<Aurora> 06lol
<Arcanine> 04lawsuits here and lawsuits there
<Arcanine> 04XD
<prince-dari> LOL, the guy doing kinect sports was really awkward too.
<Aurora> 06sounds like me when I traveled from California to Italy
<prince-dari> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQZgGtMeXXU&NR=1
<Articuno> 12XD
<Articuno> 12Italy is an hour ahead of us so it would have been more or less the same thing
<Aurora> 06got there at like 11am, and I was like "heck...what time IS it?"
<Aurora> 06I was soooooooo tired
<Articuno> 12Lol
<Aurora> 06took me 2 days to catch up
<Articuno> 12Aurora, Lugia is on a plane to England right now ^v^
<Aurora> 06I was snoozing on our boat during the day, and night time was a stroll-through-town and sit on the boat
<Aurora> 06and then I got siturated
<Aurora> 06situated
<Brother> Arti: is he hearing "hail britannia" too? :p
<Aurora> 06arti, you're what...6, 7, or 8 hours ahead of us?
<Aurora> 06california
<Aurora> 06well, what time is it, I can do math lol

<Brother> "CA-LI-FOUR-NI-AH"
<drf|work> o/` CALIFORNIA LOOOOOVE o/`
<Aurora> 06I've been paying attention to like....5 time zones this past week

<Aurora> 06korea, hawaii, my time, utah, florida, britain
<Aurora> 06killing my brain
<prince-dari> XD No.
<Brother> why hawaii?
<Articuno> 12The very first time I saw a red kite was when I flew to Leeds for the first time in 2008 XD
<Articuno> 12I saw it.. and even though I'd never seen one before.. I knew exactly what it was.
<Articuno> 12They're so distinctive
<Princess-Dairy> Wow.
<Princess-Dairy> Life.

<Articuno> 12That is the absolute worst downtime I've seen from them so far
<Articuno> 12How long does it friggin' take?! If they fixed the first server in half a day, why not ours?
<drf|work> because they hate you
*drf|work runs
<Articuno> 12D:
<drf|work> ...LOL fail, Windows XP install CD BSOD'ed
<Articuno> 12LOL
<drf|work> man, I could really use some blank discs
<Aurora> 06.....LOL
<drf|work> Windows 7 is physically incapable of erasing hard drives
<drf|work> XP CDs are awesome at that but if they use SATA you're screwed >_>
<Arcanine> 04how funny
<Cynder7> 6How come you called yourself Princess-Dairy? :P
<Arcanine> 04do you think it would of been during that animal one
<Arcanine> 04if the game froze or bluescreened in front of the little girl
<Princess-Dairy> I don't need to explain myself to you! :P
<Aurora> 06SATA?
<drf|work> SATA.
<Arcanine> 04and she thought she killed skittles
<Articuno> 12You sure?
<drf|work> it's a type of hard drive connector
<drf|work> yep
<Cynder7> 6Ok then.. :P
<drf|work> and this is the most current too
<Articuno> 12I thought I wiped mine with an XP CD before I installed Win7
<drf|work> XP with SP3
<Espeon> LOL
<drf|work> XP discs don't have SATA
<drf|work> well
<drf|work> it's probably IDE :P
<Espeon> wut
<drf|work> XP discs don't know what SATA is
<Articuno> 12No it's not..
<Aurora> 06read that as IDIE
<drf|work> so it bluescreens, not finding any hard drives
<Aurora> 06I die
<drf|work> o.o
<Arcanine> 04lol
<drf|work> is your XP CD hacked?
<drf|work> like bootleg?
<drf|work> or is it legit
<Articuno> 12Yes
<Articuno> 12LOL
<drf|work> that's why
<Articuno> 12Of course it's hacked
<Articuno> 12Ok
<drf|work> most of the bootleg ones put SATA drivers in for you
<Articuno> 12Didnh't think it was modified like that though but must be
<drf|work> this is a company, we don't use bootlegs LOL
<drf|work> *official* XP CDs, otoh
<drf|work> nope, it is
<Articuno> 12Oh yeh
<drf|work> I'd totally use DBAN if I could
<prince-dari> Yeah, or if the skipping rope decapitated 'Skittles'.
<drf|work> just no way to burn it >_>
<drf|work> I should bring in a few blank discs tomorrow XD
<Arcanine> 04lol
<Articuno> 12I'm actually surprised to hear you can't install XP on a sata drive..
<Arcanine> 04if the park ranger came and arrested her
<Arcanine> 04XD
<Articuno> 12Ovo
<prince-dari> Looooooool
<drf|work> you CAN, you just need drivers from a floppy disk
<drf|work> and th ese computers have no floppy drives
<drf|work> so eh

<drf|work> but useful for vintage stuff
<drf|work> eh, why?
<Arcanine> 04arcanine is way more floofy than Skylands
<Articuno> 12Because I don't do vintage maybe....?
<Articuno> 12It's just old trash to me

<Aurora> 06ok, well floppies were everywhere when we were that young
<Sneas> 03I has a bunch of those
<Articuno> 12I had a Windows 3.1 computer for about a year and a half.. but it had no internet and I just used it for MS paint and QBasic
<Aurora> 06I was using a computer for games at 4
<prince-dari> "Just insert your floppy disk"
<Sneas> 03One has a virus on it. :3
<drf|work> exactly
<drf|work> heck

*Obsi nibbles people
<Aurora> 06ugh o-o;;;;;
<Aurora> 06discovered my mysterygift
<drf|work> o.o what
<Aurora> 06drf would enjoy hammering it
<drf|work> an iPod?
<Aurora> 06macbook pro
<drf|work> EW
<drf|work> wait
<drf|work> what for?
<Aurora> 06my birthday i guess
<drf|work> so mystery as in your parents just bought it for you
<drf|work> ?
<Aurora> 06yeah
<drf|work> OK
<drf|work> so here's what you do
<drf|work> sell the macbook
<Aurora> 06lol
<drf|work> buy a really powerful real computer with money
<drf|work> seriously, those things cost like $1500
<drf|work> You could get a beastly laptop that'll pwn most desktops for that
<drf|work> like my MSI :)
<drf|work> or just tell your parents you don't want it and would prefer to pick out your own laptop with that money
<Aurora> 06too late for that option
<Aurora> 06it shipped from china to alaska, and it apparently on route to my stepmom's work now
<drf|work> o.o
<Aurora> 06at this point, after working weeks with macs
<drf|work> you can't just go to an Apple store and ask for a refun?
<drf|work> *d
<Aurora> 06my problems were the mouse, the keyboard, and the fact my programs would be limited
<Aurora> 06I don't want to do that, in a way I still want it lol
<drf|work> why?
<drf|work> even if you put Windows on it, the hardware still sucks
<Aurora> 06explaining it to you? difficult LOL
<Articuno> 12BACK LOL
<Aurora> 06and I'm not entirely sure
<drf|work> no but why would you possibly want a Mac?
<drf|work> wb
<Aurora> 06the BEST way to say it is that my parents just bought me a laptop without me even hinting I wanted it
<Articuno> 12I made a soup dish that my dad used to make for me :> sorta half Chinese, half Italian style
<Aurora> 06I'm not about to turn around and say no
<Aurora> 06I'm going to take it and use it
<Phoenix_Flyer> 2bah
<Articuno> 12DRF
<drf|work> use it to test your hammers with?
<Articuno> 12Sentimental value
<drf|work> what
<drf|work> XD
<drf|work> well
<Articuno> 12Like
<Articuno> 12We sold our Wii, but I didn't sell SSBB because it was a gift from Nick XD
<drf|work> my parents always ask me after I open mY Christmas gifts if there's anything I want returned
<Articuno> 12I can't play it XD it just sits there
<Articuno> 12XD
<drf|work> and I'll be liket his and this
<Aurora> 06parents always say that, drf
<drf|work> so they just return it and give me the money
<drf|work> they don't mind XD
<Aurora> 06but 99% of the time I accept it anyways
<drf|work> and I take them up on the offer
<drf|work> well make this that 1% :O
<Aurora> 06not really
<drf|work> unless you like being a mac using n00b
<Aurora> 06hey
<Aurora> 06I'm not you ok
<Articuno> 12No some people just don't like returning gifts
<Aurora> 06I don't care about apple that much
<drf|work> what about selling gifts?
*drf|work runs
<Aurora> 06but I'm not purely 100% anti-apple
<drf|work> but if you can get something way better for the same price... why not?
<Aurora> 06I prefer PC, but I'm not going to hate on something I really don't have that strong of an opinion on
<Aurora> 06what's considered way better
<drf|work> um
<Articuno> 12Because she'd have to basically say to her parents "I don;t like your gift, Im getting something better"
<drf|work> at least twice as powerful
<Aurora> 06considering I'm not as big a computer nerd as some people
<Articuno> 12DRF
<drf|work> what
<Aurora> 06it's not even that horrible
<Articuno> 12My mum bought me the most horrible dress once XD I would never in a million years wear it but I dont want to give it up
<Aurora> 06to me, at least
<drf|work> not to mention the most important thing: a working mouse
<drf|work> where you can right click
<Articuno> 12It was the thought that counted and I can't give away things that people give me ^^
<drf|work> LOL
<drf|work> well I can
<Aurora> 06I have my tablet for that
<Aurora> 06I haven't used a mouse in forever
<drf|work> does your tablet even work on a Mac?
*drf|work runs
<Articuno> 12Some people are different
<Aurora> 06yes
<Articuno> 12LMAO
<Aurora> 06it does actually
<drf|work> XD
<drf|work> well
<drf|work> at least put Windows on that thing
<drf|work> if you're gonna keep it -_-
<Aurora> 06which I'll have to do
<Aurora> 06Paint Sai wont work otherwise
<drf|work> but I mean
<drf|work> XD
<drf|work> well
<SheenaFox> Yeah, you could put Windows on it
<SheenaFox> o3o
<drf|work> just going "I don't want it" is one thing
<drf|work> telling your parents you can get something better, on the other hand
<drf|work> isn't that bad IMO
<Articuno> 12I'd feel horrible and my parents would too
<Articuno> 12:>
<Aurora> 06lol if you knew me, that's the HARDEST thing for me to ay
<Aurora> 06say
<Articuno> 12I know exactly what you mean Aurora
<drf|work> like seriously, you could get a laptop like my MSI for the same price as a macbook, and I guarantee you it's more powerful than your average desktop
<Aurora> 06becaus ei know how my parents would feel, yeh
<Aurora> 06they were actually REALLY excited about this
<drf|work> so do it behind their backs?
*drf|work runs
<Aurora> 06they had fun keeping it a surprise, and they were all so excited
<drf|work> I've seen HP laptops that look really similar to Macbooks for those retards who actually think Macbooks look cool
<Aurora> 06excet the apple
<Aurora> 06which is very noticable
<drf|work> yeah
<Aurora> 06if my computer suddenly lacks an apple
<drf|work> not if you're not looking for it though
<drf|work> XD
<Aurora> 06I know for a fact my parents would o-o
<drf|work> well
<drf|work> get one of those little skins for it
<drf|work> that covers the log
<drf|work> o
*drf|work hides
<Articuno> 12DRF come on
<Articuno> 12She wants to keep it :>
<Articuno> 12Let her
<Aurora> 06hey, let him argue about it lol
<Aurora> 06not going to change my decision
<Aurora> 06:P
<Articuno> 12XD
<drf|work> fine, I'll let you suffer with it, whatever
<Articuno> 12
<Aurora> 06I mainly hated those stupid mouses, and the stupid keyboard
<Aurora> 06both of which I wont be dealing with
<drf|work> do me a favor though, install Windows and try deleting Mac OSX with it, see what happens
*drf|work runs
<drf|work> I've always wanted to try that XD
<Aurora> 06imo, macbook pro keyboards are better than the flat craps I used before
<Articuno> 12LOL
<drf|work> except for the lack of a numpad
<RedDragonX> bah
<drf|work> which is like the single most useful thing on a keyboard
<drf|work> besides the letters o.o
<drf|work> but ew top row numbers
<Aurora> 06which to this day I don't even know what it is LOL
<drf|work> LOL fail
<Aurora> 06never used it
<drf|work> you must not type numbers a lot then o.o
<Articuno> 12Hey DRF, wtf is the point in making a macbook with OSX if you can install Windows XP on it anyway?
<Articuno> 12It's like.. why not just get an XP laptop? LOL
<Aurora> 06then again, I've been living with a laptop that lacks the right-hand numbers
<drf|work> because Apple is that stupid?
<Articuno> 12Yeh
<Aurora> 06I ONLY use the top numbers
<drf|work> LOL
<drf|work> well
<Aurora> 06that's all it has
<drf|work> my friends have laptops with no numpads
<drf|work> and it drives me crazy
<Aurora> 06which sucks for alt-number commands
<drf|work> I'm like GAAAAAH WHERE ARE THE NUMBERS
<drf|work> exactly
<Aurora> 06well
<Articuno> 12I have one of those, it annoys me too
<Aurora> 06I'm not you
<drf|work> that too :P
<SheenaFox> I have a laptop with no numpad either, I hate it
<Aurora> 06you're not me
<Aurora> 06that makes us both happy
*Aurora runs
<SheenaFox> LOL
<Articuno> 12But only since I started my job funnily enough, I used to be a top number user before that
<drf|work> my 15.4" MSI has a full numpad
<drf|work> where most similarly sized laptops don't
<Articuno> 12Then I realised that I NEEDED the numpad for work
<drf|work> XD
<drf|work> I've used the numpad as long as I could remember
<drf|work> and LOL Arti, XP laptop... that's so outdated
*drf|work runs
<Articuno> 12LOL
<Articuno> 12You know what?
<drf|work> what
<drf|work> nah, I have no problem with XP, but I'd prefer 7 XD
<Articuno> 12The numpad light used to annoy me so I'd make sure it was always off XD
<drf|work> I'm using Xp right now, since this computer is from 2003
<Aurora> 06I'm on XP, no problems
<Articuno> 12Now I don't even notice it
<drf|work> but like
<drf|work> this thing sucks
<drf|work> the DVD burner
<Aurora> 06except the zombie virus that's been lurking on it
<drf|work> burns at 1x speed
<drf|work> it's gonna take me like an hour and a half
<Articuno> 12HAHA
<drf|work> to burn one DVD
<drf|work> >_>
<drf|work> it's not my computer, it's my work's
<drf|work> they just let me use this XD
*LugiaLordOfTheSeas tackles Articuno
<Articuno> 12At least you'll get a longer lasting DVD with it
<drf|work> though I'm actually impressed how good it is for being so old
*Arcanine gives LugiaLordOfTheSeas some skittles
*Articuno explodes!
<drf|work> what?
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14^v^
<TimeShift> Germany won!
<drf|work> burning at 4 or 8x makes it last just as long
<Articuno> 12Nah
<drf|work> not to mention the stupid disc has scratches all over it
<Articuno> 12Well
<drf|work> I found it on a shelf LOL
<drf|work> only disc I could find
<SheenaFox> They did? :D
<drf|work> EW SOCCER
<TimeShift> yeah
<TimeShift> 1:0
<Aurora> 06football yes!
<drf|work> EW BOTH KINDS OF FOOTBALL
<SheenaFox> you don't like sports in general
<Articuno> 12Against who TimeShift..?
<SheenaFox> so shush you XD
<Aurora> 06ok, pigskinball is only fun during the superbowl
<Articuno> 12and you know we're playing you on Sunday..?
<TimeShift> Ghana
<drf|work> OH THAT'S JUST GREAT
<Aurora> 06and football....I like playing it, and it can be fun to watch
<drf|work> "DVD media error"
<Articuno> 12LOL Ghana
<drf|work> and it stopped burning
<drf|work> DL:
<drf|work> *D:
<drf|work> see, you just can't burn at 0.7x and expect it to work
<Articuno> 12LOL
<drf|work> "Is it live or is it Memorex?" It's DEFECTIVE is what it is :@
<drf|work> well whatever, this hard drive will take a while to format anyway so I can just burn the Windows 7 disc at home
<Sneas> 03D:
<drf|work> using a good burner XD
<drf|work> I must say, though
<Aurora> 06wow...
<Aurora> 06I can't explain how happy I feel right now
<drf|work> I'm impressed that this computer from March 2003 has a 2.8GHz dual core and 2GB of RAM
<drf|work> that's actually really good
<Aurora> 06my stepmom gave me the approval to drop this stupid summer class
<drf|work> for a second I read that as stupid laptop
*drf|work runs
<Aurora> 06I'm sitting here with about 20 tabs open for the class, realizing I could close them all
<Aurora> 06hey, a mac with windows as well
<Aurora> 06tbh, that's a good deal
<Aurora> 06both OSs on it
<Aurora> 06and I can't think of anything I'd need to run with so much power that my computer wouldn't handle it
<drf|work> like, say, a video editing program?
*drf|work hides
<Articuno> 12I HATE that TST is down v_v I miss it
<Aurora> 06I'm gonna go on a limb here, but don't macs HAVE video editing programs?
<Aurora> 06or if you're talking about my current one, 1) my laptop is old as heck, 2) my other computer is old as well, and supports files for 6 people, and 3) I'm not as competent as you in computer knowledge
<Articuno> 12Not very good ones to be fair
<Aurora> 06heck I don't even USE video editing anymore
<Articuno> 12Infact Mac only do graphic editing programs good
<drf|work> and by good she means average at best
*drf|work runs
<TimeShift> and layouting
<drf|work> seriously, there's really nothing you can do on OSX that you can't do in Windwos -_-
<drf|work> *Windows
<drf|work> you can even use like, Adobe crap on Windows
<drf|work> and yes, *crap*
<Aurora> 06Again
<Articuno> 12No, most professional graphic editing businesses use macs
<drf|work> it's bloated as frick on any OS
<Aurora> 06I've been offerend a mac
<Aurora> 06not a windows
<drf|work> Articuno, that's because they don't know better XD
<drf|work> Like
<Aurora> 06the mac will RUN a windows
<drf|work> my orthodontist's office uses Macs
<Aurora> 06I will be going into the art field, which again, USES MACS
<drf|work> are you gonna tell me taht Macs work better for fixing teeth?
<Aurora> 06so
<Aurora> 06why not
*Aurora erases that last question
<drf|work> No, they're just stupid and don't know how to use a proper computer
<drf|work> so they buy Macs
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14o.o
<Aurora> 06no, you're just being stubborn, as usual
<drf|work> no, all I'm saying is
<drf|work> why run OSX
<Aurora> 06but again
<drf|work> just put Windows on it
<Aurora> 06I don't care
<drf|work> and only use that
<drf|work> :P
<Aurora> 06what's happened has happened
<Aurora> 06I'm not going to whine, complain, and go around my parents' gift just because someone else thinks it's stupid
<Aurora> 06and I personally don't have any oposing thought
<drf|work> I'm just saying, don't bother with OSX
<drf|work> just put Windows on there and use that
<drf|work> o.o
<Arcanine> 04lol
<Articuno> 12OSX is a pain in the DHsajkfhsf for networking 
<Arcanine> 04confusion ftw
<Aurora> 06I'll have both, that's that
<drf|work> it's a pain for *everything*
<drf|work> you can't even do a simple printscreen LOL
<Kipikipo> owo;;
<drf|work> without pressing like 3 keys
<Articuno> 12Oh I know -v-
<drf|work> get this
<drf|work> I found this iTunes decrypter for iTunes 9 that was Mac only
<drf|work> so I tried it on a Mac
<drf|work> and it didn't work
<drf|work> >_>
<Articuno> 12and you can crash it by doing 9999999999999 x 99999999999 on the calc (or you could.. but they may have fixed that because it didnt work the last time i tried XD)
<drf|work> LOL nice
<drf|work> I need to try that
<drf|work> did I show you that one demotivator I made?
<Articuno> 12Dont remember

<drf|work> he's not, that's the thing
<Andrew> hihi
<Articuno> 12LOL
<Articuno> 12Hi ^v^
<drf|work> anyone who thinks Steve Jobs actually knows what he's doing is an idiot
<drf|work> Arti, did you see the video of the iPhone 4 epically failing in front of millions of people?
<drf|work> :D
<Articuno> 12Sorry but the only thing he's done right is rip off stupid people
<drf|work> Yep
<Articuno> 12I haven't seen it but I've heard about it loads of times
<Aurora> 06tbh, as funny as that is, I don't see why that was all his fault
<Articuno> 12Infact I'll go watch it now
<drf|work> why what was, Aurora?
<Aurora> 06the phone not connecting
<drf|work> well
<drf|work> it wasn't, but
<drf|work> if you watch later on
<drf|work> he's all "Everybody turn off your computers and put them on the ground so my phone will work"
<drf|work> that's just retarded
<drf|work> if you can't use the iPhone with someone else on the network, wtf is the pint
<drf|work> *point
<Aurora> 06ok yeah, that part was...stupid (lack of a better word)
<drf|work> :P
<Articuno> 12What the hell?
<Articuno> 12Was he being serious?
<drf|work> and it's also his fault for designing the thing
<drf|work> Yep
<drf|work> dead serious
<Aurora> 06everyone did it lol
<Articuno> 12.....
<Articuno> 12How?
<drf|work> because he's STUPID
<prince-dari> Skittles. D:
<drf|work> that's why
<Articuno> 12How can you NOT use a phone with computers?
<Articuno> 12Lol
<drf|work> well
<drf|work> he thought the network was being overloaded by too many people using it
<prince-dari> Not want.
<Articuno> 12Oh right XD
<Articuno> 12LOL
<drf|work> in reality the phone just plain sucks as all other Apple products to
<drf|work> *do
<drf|work> and that's why it wasn't connecting
<drf|work> XD
<Aurora> 06while I don't have much opinion on the macbook....I'm so far against iPhones I could be related to drf
*Aurora runs
<Articuno> 12I like how the first thing he mentions is how it "looks" of course
<Articuno> 12and how beautiful it is -v-
<drf|work> yeah
<Articuno> 12Wow he goes on about that for AGES
<drf|work> Well I admit the Macbook can be decent if you put Windows on it
<drf|work> it's just OSX = fail, overpriced hardware = fail, lack of proper right click = fail, combine those and it's 3x fail
<Articuno> 12Only because it's light XD
<drf|work> well that too
<drf|work> then again my MSI isn't too heavy
<Aurora> 06proper right click doesn't apply to me
<drf|work> like 6 pounds
<Aurora> 06I have means of it
<drf|work> Macbooks are what, 5?
<drf|work> LOL
<Aurora> 06so in your terms, it's only 2xs fail

<drf|work> Aurora, but 99% of Macbook users are stupid and LIKE OSX
<Aurora> 06hey, my blackberry, while old, is still awesome
<drf|work> XD
<drf|work> well
<drf|work> I've never really cared for Blackberry
<Aurora> 06I'm the 1% that doesn't care either way then
<drf|work> I don't HATE them like I do iphones
<drf|work> I just don't like the tiny keyboards XD
<Aurora> 06mine's a pearl, so even SMALLER keyboards ftw

<Brother> arg commercials
<Aurora> 06Articuno, your art was what first led me to the site, what first brought me to DA, and first made me realize that I could expand my art talent
<Aurora> 06because of that, it gave me a life goal, and you've always been an idol (and soon after, a friend)
<Aurora> 06I can't bear to watch my idol and great friend give up on something she loved doing for so long
<Aurora> 06:>

<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14How are you hun? ^^
<Articuno> 12What speech?
<Articuno> 12Hang on I'll read up LOL
<TimeShift> Arti's art inspired many people, to pick the ball from earlier again :)
<Articuno> 12Awww.. well..
<drfsupercenter> 03well, they basically just gotta buy a new mirror for the SUV
<Articuno> 12Aurora you've out done me, you don't need me now XD
*Articuno runs
<Articuno> 12You're a much better artist than I could ever be, I just don't have the time to dedicate to it
<Aurora> 06what ARE you talking about, you peadge
<Articuno> 12But even then I always hated that I couldn't draw details and you can :>
<Articuno> 12Thats what makes a better artist
<Aurora> 06you don't need that much time. what I'm doing is for my career
<Aurora> 06that's my life
<drfsupercenter> 03Good artists create, great artists steal
*drfsupercenter runs
<Aurora> 06but you can still do it for your enjoyment
<Articuno> 12Not really.
<Articuno> 12It's not that fun anymore
<Articuno> 12Because i can't draw what I want to draw
<Aurora> 06because you don't think you can D:
<Aurora> 06...
<Aurora> 06that
<Aurora> 06which is why you can't D:
<Azure> 12Not bad. XD You?
<Articuno> 12I always used to believe I was the best Lugia artist in the world, but then I started struggling to draw it and only after many months of that did I start to think "I suck."
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I'm good :>
<Articuno> 12It's nothing to do with my mindset, it's just me
<Azure> 12Yay :3
<Articuno> 12I'm not really an artist D:
<Articuno> 12I'm a cartoonist
<Articuno> 12and Lugia became too complicated for me
<Aurora> 06complicated D:
<Aurora> 06well
<Aurora> 06you have something I don't
<Aurora> 06your style is so recognizeable
<Articuno> 12LOL
<Aurora> 06I can see a picture of lugia done by you without any info, and know immediately it was you
<Articuno> 12Everyone has that
<Articuno> 12They just can't see it themselves
<Aurora> 06not really
<Articuno> 12I can see your style
<Aurora> 06true I can't see my own
<Aurora> 06but when yours is dead recognizeable, AND consistent
<Aurora> 06mine's not consistant
<Articuno> 12I once made a journal saying "Do I have a style?"
<Aurora> 06yes you do
<Articuno> 12Omg but
<Articuno> 12Dunno how you can call this consitant
<Articuno> 12http://www.lugia.us/media/art/free/mamepato.gif
<Articuno> 12http://articuno.deviantart.com/#/d1lg4mf
<drfsupercenter> 03that seriously looks like Nintendo promo art
<Aurora> 06your coloring style for one
<drfsupercenter> 03I didn't realize you drew that XD
<Articuno> 12Two completely different styles there
<Aurora> 06and you always draw beaks the same way
<drfsupercenter> 03take that as a compliment
<Articuno> 12See?
<Aurora> 06and feathers
<Aurora> 06I can tell its yours
<Aurora> 06drf is just not art-attuned
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Articuno> 12I can tell your art is yours too believe me
<Aurora> 06ok well, that aside
<drfsupercenter> 03oh btw
<drfsupercenter> 03Articuno

<Lyalia> Heya!
<drfsupercenter> 03inb4 no
<Aurora> 06you have a distinct style, and one of the most well known lugia artists out there
<Aurora> 06if not THE artist
<Articuno> 12I was one of the most well known, but I haven't drawn Lugia since last year Ovo
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway
<drfsupercenter> 03Articuno
<drfsupercenter> 03http://drfsupercenter.ath.cx/drfsupercenter%20Banner.bmp <-- That was made a while ago, back when I used to use Geocities
<Aurora> 06doesn't mater
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd like that to be changed to www.drfsupercenter.com
<Articuno> 12You're the top Lugia artist to me
<Aurora> 06people still know you
<drfsupercenter> 03without hurting the rest
<drfsupercenter> 03think that's possible?
*Aurora hugs ^^
<Articuno> 12People know the old me
<Articuno> 12Errrrr
<Articuno> 12Easily
<Aurora> 06we know you as a person, so we know what you're going through
<TimeShift> still I wait for at least a 2-minute-pencil-sketch done by you Arti^^
<drfsupercenter> 03that's why I asked if you could do it
<Articuno> 12Just go over all that part in black
*drfsupercenter runs
<Aurora> 06but for those on DA, they STILL know you
<drfsupercenter> 03wait

<Airwolve> http://fukung.net/v/8459/beaefcabab7acd01572fe4b73a172ce2.gif

<Aurora> 06sure
<drfsupercenter> 03that's like me telling you
<Aurora> 06it's not that hard LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03that reformatting a PC is easy
<drfsupercenter> 03it is to me
<drfsupercenter> 03but you'd be like WTF
<Aurora> 06ok then,we uderstand each other :>
<drfsupercenter> 03I admit to knowing nothing about art short of like copy and paste into Paint
*Aurora will do that
<drfsupercenter> 03and save
<drfsupercenter> 03I do that all the time XD
<drfsupercenter> 03and cropping. I can do that too
<Lyalia> ......
<Articuno> 12Well, you can't reference from my art anymore, just look at the latest piece I did LOL
<Lyalia> Articuno x.x
<Lyalia> Holy crap
<Aurora> 06arti, you gotta not be so down on yourself
<Articuno> 12When it takes you about 100 tries to make a HALF decent Lugia..
<Articuno> 12It kinda gets you down
<prince-dari> If you're not enjoying it, just take a break for a bit?
<Articuno> 12I have been
<Articuno> 12About half a year break
<Articuno> 12and then I made a piece of crap and now I'm sad again
<Articuno> 12Because I actually really WANT to be able to draw how I used to
<Airwolve> I thought you always claimed those drawings were bad though
*Airwolve cough]
<Articuno> 12No i'm proud of most of them
<Aurora> 06perhaps go reference form the video a bit then?
<Articuno> 12Like the Soul Silver one, the Wave watchinfg one
<Articuno> 12a few others
<Aurora> 06and drf
<Aurora> 06http://img256.imageshack.us/img256/6813/drfbanneredit.png
<Aurora> 06that's what you wanted?
<drfsupercenter> 03woah
<drfsupercenter> 03well I wanted it with text
<drfsupercenter> 03but sure
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Aurora> 06oh lol
<Aurora> 06Sai is a failure with text, unfornately
<prince-dari> Sai? O_o
<Aurora> 06but I can open another program
<drfsupercenter> 03I just want the same picture, with the same drfsupercenter text, just the drfsupercenter stuck where geocities is
<drfsupercenter> 03and re-centered
<Aurora> 06k
<Articuno> 12You can redo the text DRF
<Aurora> 06sai
<drfsupercenter> 03um
<Lyalia> LOL
<Aurora> 06paint sai
<drfsupercenter> 03what font is that anyway?
<Lyalia> I was laughing SO hard about that
<Aurora> 06not a clue
*Lyalia returns
<drfsupercenter> 03wouldn't it be easier to just move it?
<drfsupercenter> 03if I knew the font I'd retype it XD
<Articuno> 12http://articuno.deviantart.com/#/d217d29
<Articuno> 12This
<Articuno> 12Is the only pic I am almost 100% proud of
<drfsupercenter> 03I acutally don't like that one as much as some of your old one
<drfsupercenter> 03s
<Articuno> 12I even made it into a poster for my bedroom wall and it's my wallpaper at work
*Aurora adds her name to the biggest lugia fans in that description
*Aurora then runs
<Articuno> 12Yeh DRF for some reason prefers stuff like that http://articuno.deviantart.com/gallery/#/dcw96g
<Articuno> 12To that http://articuno.deviantart.com/#/d217d29
<Aurora> 06lol
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<drfsupercenter> 03that one's alright
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03I like that one you did
<drfsupercenter> 03that I stole and made as a DVD cover
<Articuno> 12LOL
<Articuno> 12I copied that off the movie
<drfsupercenter> 03somehow the comical ones look better to me than the "realistic" ones
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah but it was cool :)
<Articuno> 12Yeh but it wasn't my own pose
<Articuno> 12i just traced it off the movie
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't care

<Aurora> 06chores, food, and stuff to do
<Aurora> 06I should go now
<Aurora> 06bye all
<Aicebo> yay
<Lyon> 04cya
<Lambda> and I'm extremely tired now too]
<Aicebo> me too I only got up a couple hours ago x__x
<Lambda> I got up couple minutes ago :P
<Aicebo> awesome :P
<Stormy|Work> hey
<Lambda> Hey Stormy
<Stormy|Work> my grandpa is here for dinner so I won't be on much or I'll get yelled at more
<Lambda> that's okay
<Aicebo> lol stormy did you get my pm that I sent last night
<Stormy|Work> Yeah
<Aicebo> did you laugh
<Stormy|Work> I didn't know Swaffy cared so much about getting my gender right
<Stormy|Work> Yeah :P
<Aicebo> hahahaha
<Lambda> lolwut
<Stormy|Work> http://www.spyroforum.com/post-326797.html#326797
<Lambda> lol
<carrington> hey does anyone know who the produsers r of the spyro movie o where...
<Lambda> and Neotyguy continues to say "he"
<Stormy> Seriously?
<Stormy> XD
<Lambda> yep
<Stormy> fail
<Stormy> I even told him on SC that I was a girl
<Aicebo> yeah even though we corrected him ourselves
<Aicebo> yeah
<Lambda> In reply to your insults over my intelligence, I have already been told this, and I do in fact already know.
<Lambda> Stormy and I had an agreement in Spyro Chat, and I will continue to call him that. You want to know why?
<Lambda> Because it doesn't matter...
<Lambda> And because I apparently I guess EVERY SINGLE PERSON'S GENDER ON THE CHAT WRONG(except SpyroRocks). Yea, that was a very strange conversation we had
<Lambda> Have a splendid day, and next time try not to insult others out in the open.
<Lambda> ^ He admits you told him but still gets itm wrong
<Lambda> XD
<Stormy> Lol fail
<Stormy> it's kind of funny
<Stormy> the forum is in complete chaos with no mods around
<Lambda> hahaha, yeah
<Aicebo> look at sr's post
<Stormy> Proof that anarchy wouldn't work
<Lambda> Haha, perfect
<Lambda> we should show spyroforum to Nate
<Proto> welcome back Stormy
<Stormy> hi, thanks
<Aicebo> we're not going to purosely wreck havoc on here now are we? :|
<Proto> np
<Stormy> No
<Stormy> Or at least, I'm not
<Aicebo> really though I wonder why SR is trying to be all friendly with swaffy
<Lambda> me neither
<Stormy> But I'm not going to make any effort to stop anyone who wants to either :P
<Aicebo> if he makes swaffy a mod....e____e
<Lambda> ..what?
<Lambda> oh wait
<Princess-Dairy> He likes him because Swaffy is a fellow Christian. :P
<Lambda> for a second I didn't read the "if"
<Stormy> I'd just sit back and lol as all the members leave
<Aicebo> Princess-Dairy: he's not a christian he's a missionary there's a difference IMO :P
<Brother|Pride> lyon: you have only morrowind right?
<Stormy> Missionaries are Christians, but not all Christians are missionaries
<Stormy> But yeah, Swaffy would not be a good mod
<Aicebo> ...kind of what I was meaning :P
<Stormy> I know
<Stormy> I was agreeing
<Aicebo> swaffy would be terrible he'd probably ban people like neotyguy
<Stormy> Yeah
<Aicebo> just for being athiest
<Aicebo> I can totally see it right now
<Stormy> And he'd edit everyone's posts and fix the chatspeak and typos
<Lambda> XD
<Stormy> Because he has OCD!!!!
<Lambda> A Missionary grammar nazi
<Aicebo> yeah remember when he said that he would if he was a mod??
<Aicebo> uggggh

<prince-dari> Ok.
<Stormy> Hey Aristeo
<carrington> i cant believe the movie was canceled! spyro is my life and im only 11. i got a pro artist to paint him just for me, ive got a screen saver for my phone, pictures, and even huge posters!
<Aicebo> and I hate his blue font and how he always pushes the enter key in the middle of his posts to make it look "neater" when it's really just SO [censored]ING ANNOYING I WANT TO [censored]ING KICK A BABY IN THE WANG GRDUGDLRHR
<Aicebo> so
<Aicebo> pretty much
<Lambda> Haha
<Aicebo> words cannot describe my hate for swaffy
<Aicebo> :D
<Stormy> I know what you mean about the enter thing
<Stormy> I read it like there's a random break in the middle of his sentences
<Lambda> or like he's trying to write poetry with his posts
<Aicebo> idk why but it really makes me laugh how he's hardcore christian missionary but he's a guy with hearts in his avatar
<LaptopAristeo> *rawr*
<LaptopAristeo> I'm in Calculus again
<Stormy> Did you see that some member left because they're sick of religion and dragons being brought up everywhere?
<Aicebo> it just screams GAAAAAY to me
<Aicebo> yeah I did
<Stormy> It was Starscream or something
<Aicebo> I don't blame them
<Aicebo> they were mad because the topic would go from dragons /to/ religion
<Nala> o.o
<Aicebo> or I think that's what they were trying to say
<LaptopAristeo> Nala!!!!!!!!!!! :D
<Stormy> Oh yeah, maybe
<LaptopAristeo> One moment, gotta do a quiz
<Nala> =]
<Stormy> I didn't read it very carefully
<Lambda> zI honestly didn't mind all the religious discussions as long as they didn't go crazy about it
<Stormy> I don't either
<Lambda> And then Neotyguy got all [censored]y in the about you thread because we were all saying our religions
<Aicebo> people just need to be open to the fact that their beliefs aren't the only ones
<Lambda> that annoyed me\
<Stormy> I don't get why it's such a big deal that people talk about religion
<Stormy> It doesn't even annoy me that much when they bring it into everything
<Lambda> it's like, I consider my religion to be part of who I am, why can't I mention it
<Stormy> Because that's just part of who they are
<Stormy> Exactly
<carrington> im gonna call the peeps who tried to make this movie and im gonna give them a piece of my mind!!!!!!!!
<Aicebo> my beliefs change every day
<Stormy> It's the same with atheism; I'm not atheist, but I don't care if people want to talk about being atheist all the time
<Lambda> same here
<Aicebo> so I don't understand how people get so mad when another person has a different religion
<Stormy> Yeah, it's stupid
<Aicebo> so idk why they all get so fried
<Lambda> I just look at atheism as another religion really
<Lyon> 04Brother: Yes, I only have Morrowind
<Stormy> If you're comfortable with your own religion, it shouldn't bother you that other people have different ones than you
<Lambda> exactly
<Stormy> Getting upset about things like that tells me you're insecure
<Stormy> Might not be the case, but that's how I tend to interpret it
<Aicebo> I do kind of wonder how in the world SpyroForum attracts so many overly-obsessed people like swaffy, spyro22, and adam thurman though
<Lambda> and on the other side of the spectrum there's apoc
<prince-dari> http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z204/prince-dari/drfsupercenterBanner-1.png
<Stormy> And on the other side, Raidon Makoto and Fletch_Talon
<Stormy> And Apoc
<Aicebo> yeah
<Lambda> he's a bit over obsessed with his atheism
<Aicebo> apoc is just rude about it all
<Aicebo> it irritates me
<Lambda> yeah he is
<prince-dari> Good?
<Stormy> I think it's because they feel more comfortable being like that onlinen
<Aicebo> I mean really there's no reason to insult people in that way about it
<Brother|Pride> for what system?
<Stormy> maybe there are a lot more people who are like that in real life, but they're just afraid to show it
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<drfsupercenter> 03looks alright, but for some reason the letters look weird
<drfsupercenter> 03for the green text on top
<Lambda> and then they go online and they're a bunch of over obsessed reliious folk
<Stormy> this kind of reminds me of a thread on another forum
<Lambda> what was it about?
<Stormy> Basically this person is getting angry because no one accepts her Buddhism
<Lambda> ah
<Lambda> TS?
<Stormy> Yet she doesn't even want to read about other religions when it's assigned in school
<Stormy> No, GTS+
<Lambda> ah, I see
<Lambda> heh
<Stormy> I've been hanging around there lately
<Lambda> I don't get that
<Princess-Dairy> I can just imagine Swaffy telling his boss that he's going to go to hell for some reason or other.
<Aicebo> that reminds me of something that Spyro22 said, he said he failed his religion class because "it's so hard because he's not the other religions"
<Lambda> I love learning about other religions
<Stormy> So now one of the mods is arguing with people in the thread
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah prince-dari, it seems to have lowered the quality
<Aicebo> it's like, you don't have to be that religion to learn about other religions
<Princess-Dairy> "YOU'RE FIRED, GET OUT OF MY DAMN OFFICE!"
<drfsupercenter> 03http://img35.imageshack.us/img35/2003/drfsupercenterbannerfix.png
<Stormy> It's kind of entertaining to watch
<drfsupercenter> 03check that though
<drfsupercenter> 03I think that looks good
<Stormy> http://forums.gtsplus.net/index.php?showtopic=38684
<prince-dari> Ok.
<Lambda> one of my favorute cl[censored] last year was the one where I learned about how Jews and Muslims interpret things differently than Christians
<drfsupercenter> 03yours was good but the text got kinda weird
<drfsupercenter> 03so w/e
<Stormy> Blueflame == me if you didn't figure that out :P
<prince-dari> Oh yeah, I see what you mean.
<Lambda> wow
<Lambda> nice post
<Lambda> I love when somebody comes in and tells the OP exactly how it is
<drfsupercenter> 03thanks for the effort though
<Stormy> Also, click my eggs plz
<Stormy> :P
<drfsupercenter> 03and I gotta run an errand, bbl
<Stormy> and thanks
<Lambda> :P
<Lambda> the dragon ones?
<Stormy> yeah
<Stormy> But yeah, Reyo has pretty much taken the debate now
<Stormy> I don't know him, but he seems awesome
<Aicebo> argh, too many long posts.
<Stormy> I didn't read all of them either
<Stormy> just kind of skimmed
<Lambda> same
<Creideiki> (Relative) hello to you all.
<Feather> 10hi Creideiki
<Aicebo> blarg, screenshots are too small on my SV for some reason :|
<Stormy> I'll be back later, food's ready
<Aicebo> k
<Lambda> k
<Stormy> It'll probably be longer than 10 minutes this time though since my grandpa's here
<Lambda> lol
<Aicebo> hmm
<Brother|Pride> and done
<Lambda> actually I'm gonna go eat as well
<Aicebo> ok
<Lambda> be back later

<Sneas> 03:5
<Sneas> 032:
<TimeShift> looks like our host messed-up the PHP module or something like that
<TimeShift> I made a test PHP document with only this content:
<TimeShift> <?php
<TimeShift> phpinfo( );
<TimeShift> ?>
<TimeShift> and THAT's what the server responds to it
<TimeShift> http://www.lugia.us/phpinfo.php
<Sneas> 03o.o
<TimeShift> therefore: Module fail
<drf|work> but yet my cgiproxy makes the site work :)
<TimeShift> oh?
<TimeShift> show me
<drf|work> http://www.drfsupercenter.info/cgiproxy/nph-proxy.pl/000000A/http/www.lugia.us/
<monobi> Hey everyone
<TimeShift> hrm - looks like a translation error then
<drf|work> dunno
<drf|work> I just discovered that last night
<drf|work> so I'm telling people to use it
<Prince-dari> Lol, you can edit anything with notepad! XD
<TimeShift> maybe it's a compressed stream
<drf|work> hm
<drf|work> well the forums actually work fine at my house
<drf|work> just nobody else was able to get on
<drf|work> so i tried it with my proxy, and bingo
<drf|work> apparently sometime last night the main site started working too
<Sneas> 03lolnotepad :3
<TimeShift> ....
<TimeShift> those pieces of idiotic fools. They really messed-up the config of the server. It delivers the pages compressed and your proxy does nothing but unpack the stream again
<TimeShift> just what a proxy would do
<drf|work> oh
<drf|work> so can you unpack it besides using a proxy?
<drf|work> I'm curious, though, why I'm able to use the forum at my house then... without a proxy
<Prince-dari> Only pieces of idiotic fools? Not whole ones?
<drf|work> LOL
<Prince-dari> I guess you already cut them up in your anger. :o
<TimeShift> that would give me a reason to think about. Meaning: Someone's within your data stream already and reading + unpackig it
<TimeShift> that's still optional
<drf|work> what's still optional
<drf|work> unpacking the data?
<TimeShift> nope, cutting the host's staff into pieces
<drf|work> speaking of idiotic fools
<drf|work> http://cheezfailbooking.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/funny-facebook-making-sence.png?w=225&h=319
<drf|work> oh.
<Proto> Hi
<TimeShift> plus - the fools are REALLY crazy oO
<TimeShift> take a look at the config
<TimeShift> http://www.drfsupercenter.info/cgiproxy/nph-proxy.pl/000000A/http/www.lugia.us/phpinfo.php
*Grimm goes to feed tokey and smokey
*Light_Lati sighs...
<Espeon> o
<Espeon> lol
<Altair> hi LL
<Espeon> the caveman editing tool
<TimeShift> they installed litespeed without implementing threat safety or even activating the packager function on php
<Espeon> but then again if you know what you're doing = rocket science
*Espeon hides
<Altair> notepad does it all
<Light_Lati> 12hai...
<TimeShift> therefore - all the contents are transmitted via bzip-compression, but the php module has no idea about it. Therefore no browser understands it and receives these data-farts we get if we jump onto the page directly
<Prince-dari> I tried editing an image with notepad once, didn't end well. :o
<TimeShift> that also explains why static pages are NOT affected (see www.lugia.us/index.htm for instance)
<drf|work> hm
<Altair> well
<Altair> yeah programs, images and music files don't usually work well xD
<Prince-dari> I find it annoying the PS always associates itself with PHP files.
<Prince-dari> that*
<Altair> I hate programs that assume it's OK to steal all file associations

<carrington> dang......... im only 11
<Cynder7> 6Are you new here?
<carrington> yes i surf the web trying to get info on the movie spyro and i came here and relized it was canceld i was so sad
<Cynder7> 6EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK
<Cynder7> 6Ah
<Cynder7> 6Welcome :P
<carrington> i love spyro hes my life i have a sceen saver of him!
<Cynder7> 6iFail
<carrington> y the crap did u log of then on again
<Icydragon> There's an iFail?
<Cynder7> 6I accidently refreshed the page..-.-
<Kjakings> 7C7: uDo
<Lyalia> raaaaaaaaaar
<carrington> what do peeps do in here other than talk
<Icydragon> Complain.
<Kjakings> 7mess with bots before SR bans them
<carrington> i heard something about a game called spyro the darkest hour
<Aristeo> Nala: How's you?
<Cynder7> 6That came 1,5 years ago
<carrington> it already came out
<Cynder7> 6And was re-named TLoS Dawn of the Dragon
<carrington> oh well that was the first spyro game i played ever and then i herd of the origonal sieres y do peeps like it better
<Kjakings> 7it's funner. more fantasmical
<Arcanine> 04sigh
<Arcanine> 04i hate this game
<carrington> so what u can fly in dawn of the dagon and the graphics r amazing
<carrington> i probably shouldve made a name up instead of using my real one
<Kjakings> 7right, but graphics a game does not make. You should not base your entire opinion of the game on the graphics. Base it on how much fun you're having
<carrington> exactly but ive nevr playd anyothers ecept eternal night
*Aristeo sits next to Nala
<Cynder7> 6I think Eternal Night was the best of the TLoS..
<Kjakings> 7I hate TEN
<Proto> We got no food, we got no jobs, our pets /heads/ are fallin' off!!!!
<Espeon> .-.
<Spyrorocks> woot
<Spyrorocks> jim carry
<carrington> cynder7 i think dawn of the dragon was the best
<Quilava> then don't play?
<PokemonStar> 13!Espeon
*Espeon now belongs to PokemonStar for 4 minutes
<Proto> find a happy place, find a happy place, find a happy place
<Arcanine> 04there is nothing else for me to play
<carrington> whos TEN?
<Spyrorocks> The eternal night
<Arcanine> 04i just wish for once
<Arcanine> 04that i could find a game that i actually feel confident at
<Quilava> play 1D tetris
<Arcanine> 04instead of a game that i practice at for over a year and never get better
<carrington> oh. it easnt that much fun evn though i havent finshed it
<Quilava> its really REALLY hard to be bad at
<Arcanine> 04trust me i'll find a way
<Quilava> probably the negative reinforcement
<Arcanine> 04negative reinforcement?
<Spyrorocks> I havent gotten around to trying DotD
<Michel> he means: look at everythings bad sides and whining about it will definitly NOT help you :/
<Arcanine> 04i guess you can say that, it's called karma
<Quilava> you saying that you suck
<Arcanine> 04i must of been hitler in a past life or something
<Michel> you know, that you can change your karma, right? :P
<Arcanine> 04by doing good things?
<Arcanine> 04that's not in my nature 8D
<carrington> whats dotd
<Michel> no... by practicing - learning of mistakes and ask for advice rather then constant whinig about bad luck :P
<Arcanine> 04bad luck is the only plausable explanation
<Spyrorocks> Dawn of the Dragon.
<Michel> i have proven you wrong on the "bad luck" part already... but you only see what you WANT to see :(
<Michel> so... what you call "karma" is just what you make of it
<Arcanine> 04what proof?
<Michel> metronom battle...
<Arcanine> 04i lost more matches than you in metronome battles lol
<Arcanine> 04it was very close to 50/50 though
<carrington> u should its the best game ecept spyro,cynder, and ignitus dies but ignitus turns into the chroniclor
<Michel> thats called "statistic" not bad luck :P
<Arcanine> 04statistics is luck
<Arcanine> 04or rather statistics is how luck is measured
<Azure|away> 12Back for now
<Kjakings> 7they don't die
<Arcanine> 04wb
<Azure> 12Ty
<Arcanine> 04i swear that shaco was a hacker
<carrington> have u seen the ending cutscene? they give ther life to save the world then in
<Arcanine> 04he had a godlike by like level 8
<Kjakings> 7have you seen the epilogue cutscene?
<Kjakings> 7always watch the credits
<Arcanine> 04maybe earlier
<carrington> epilogue? thers a show after the credits in dotd
<Arcanine> 04and of course i had to argue with my team-mates again that it was a lost match within the first 5 minutes of the match after shaco was decently fed
<Azure> 12blarg
<Kjakings> 7they're just flying about in some trees
<Kjakings> 7though how they survived defies all logic
<Arcanine> 04by the time i could even call out a surrender, they were already beating at the nexus
<Cynder7> 6Lol.
<Dan> hi
<Brother> wb
<Brother> hey
<Cynder7> 6Probably save with the power of Spyro's love or something..
<carrington> hat did he do in dotd to put the world back together he rose and turned purple light
<Kjakings> 7yeah. he became such a sue at the end
<Kjakings> 7when you have the power to PUT THE WORLD BACK TOGETHER, very little else stands in your way
<Cynder7> 6Lol
<carrington> do u think they will make any more games

<Brother> thats such a name for a story
<Brother> like Eclipse or Breaking Dawn
<Japan> and... first of all, half the class takes a look at the first illustration of the main two characters talking, who are a 40-year old man and a Middle Schooler
<Japan> and thinks "whoa BL"
<drf-Droid> LOLPEDO
<Brother> inb4 pedophile?
*Brother dies
<Japan> so they laugh at that
<Brother> I think even..well yeah drf's class would laugh at that
<Japan> and later, the teacher asks, "What do you think Zebra wants to do with Mr. Wilson?" meaning, "What do you think that he wants to say by drawing a helicopter for the class"
<Japan> aaaand everyone laughs at that
<Japan> for... several minutes
<drf-Droid> LOL
<drf-Droid> LOL

<Glacymr> 12i already beat it
<Aristeo> Hi Kiara!
<Kiara> look it me
<DarkTruth> hey :D
*Aristeo pouncenoms Kiara
<Theguesst> I know
<Glacymr> 12took me an entire day to beat the 5th episode XD
<Kiara> hehe
<Glacymr> 12but it was fun as heck
<Kiara> heyz everyone
<Theguesst> I was asking if you liked it overall compared to the rest
<Theguesst> That's all
<Theguesst> I might go back and beat it one day, but I've set that game aside for now
<drfsupercenter> 03o/` eat it, eat it, get yourself and egg and beat it o/`
<Glacymr> 12Theguesst
<Theguesst> Is that a weird al spoof of beat it?
<Proto> Hey Kiara
<drfsupercenter> 03Yes?
<Glacymr> 12this deck i made is so funny XD
<drfsupercenter> 03you haven't heard it?
<Proto> Feeling any better?
<Theguesst> No?
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03it's a classic
<Theguesst> I didn't know it existed?
<drfsupercenter> 03from like 1984
<drfsupercenter> 03look it up sometime
<drfsupercenter> 03one of my favorite Weird Al songs
<Theguesst> I will
<drfsupercenter> 03k
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Theguesst> Eventually
<drfsupercenter> 03I made a video on YouTube too, showing how similar it is to the original
<drfsupercenter> 03using the track from Guitar Hero
<drfsupercenter> 03of Beat It
<drfsupercenter> 03and just changing the audio
<Theguesst> I already looked up fat just two weeks ago
<Theguesst> The song
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Theguesst> Slash spoof
<Glacymr> 12Theguesst
<Glacymr> 12the strategy
<drfsupercenter> 03no, it's a parody of Bad
<drfsupercenter> 03that one's alright, but I like Eat It better
<Glacymr> 12basically get 4 kingdra prime out turn 1
<Theguesst> Indeed it is
<Theguesst> ...
<Glacymr> 12and with expert belt and hit for 120 XD
<Theguesst> O_O
<Glacymr> 12problem though is that it autoloses to spiritomb
<Glacymr> 12i'll say this Theguesst
<Glacymr> 12the build for this deck is funny as heck
<Theguesst> Why not add the psudo gust of wind cards to counter it?
<Theguesst> I dun remember the name :p
<Glacymr> 1218 Pokemon, 4 Energy, 38 Trainers
<Glacymr> 12XD
<Theguesst> What happens after you get the kingdra out?
<Glacymr> 12you keep spamming for 120
<Glacymr> 124 spray splash
<Glacymr> 12dragon steam
<Theguesst> I mean, the opponent has time to prepare for a machamp at least
<Theguesst> With
<Theguesst> Not for
<Glacymr> 12if i come across machamp
<Glacymr> 12i just use superscoop up to scoop up a kingdra prime
<Glacymr> 12drop it down again and spraysplash a 5th time
<Theguesst> K
<Glacymr> 12it's too hard to fit crobat into the deck
<Theguesst> Now what about the new celebi...
<Kyu> 07o3o
<Glacymr> 12what about celebi?
*drfsupercenter dies
<Theguesst> The one that was recently announded in japan
<Glacymr> 12Theguesst
<Theguesst> For the new set
<Japan> eh?
<Glacymr> 12the deck isn't meant to win
<Glacymr> 12it's just a funny deck
<Japan> ... oh
<Theguesst> Well comical it is
<Japan> *should really change nicks*
<Glacymr> 12speaking of funnydeck
<Glacymr> 12you should see the funnydeck my friend made
<Glacymr> 12dude
<Theguesst> I remember someone using te old kingdras a few years ago
<Glacymr> 12Delbird and Feraligatr prime
<Theguesst> Same thing :p
<Glacymr> 12you usualy lose the game for yourself turn 2
<Theguesst> Exactly
<Glacymr> 12you attach like 14 energy to your pokemon
<Glacymr> 12then use delibird's attack to draw 14 cardsXD
<Theguesst> Perfect deck deck
<Theguesst> As I like to call them
<Theguesst> Or just "deck deck"
<Glacymr> 12if you don't autowin
<Glacymr> 12you just deck yourself XD
<Glacymr> 12Theguesst
<Theguesst> So I went through my gatr lumin deck to find flaws and replacable cards. I found out I needed pokemon communications since I had none ( and rare candies since I only had 2 per deck ). However, NOBODY at league has any to trade.
<Glacymr> 12i wish i still had UR Donked still built XD
<Glacymr> 12basically
<Glacymr> 124 uxie
<Glacymr> 123 crobat
<Glacymr> 122 psychic energy and the rest is burn cards XD
<Glacymr> 12like drawrers and pokedex and blowers
<Kyu> 07ohai Beto
<Theguesst> What happened to it?
<Glacymr> 12i took it apart
<Theguesst> Thought so
<Glacymr> 12i personally think spiritomb
<Glacymr> 12was the biggest party crasher card ever made
<Theguesst> I agree
<Glacymr> 12i bet
<Glacymr> 12a lot of unlimited players
<Glacymr> 12have gotten really irritated with these last sets
<Theguesst> I mean, no trainers at all until it dies
<Glacymr> 12first they make deafen dialga
<Glacymr> 12then they make spiritomb
<Glacymr> 12the final straw was turning bill into a supporter
<Glacymr> 12they wrecked unlimited
<Theguesst> XD
<Theguesst> Eh
<Theguesst> I'd still play either way
<Kiara> oh, oops i blind, i feeling a lil better
<Proto> heh
<Proto> that's good
<Kiara> twiching more tho
<Glacymr> 12lol
<Proto> :(
<Glacymr> 12i should just play that silly feraligatr delibird deck
<Glacymr> 12for the entire season this year
<Glacymr> 12i lost hope in the game after they announced the rotation
<Glacymr> 12they basically took my fears from last year
<Aeroslash> night all
<Glacymr> 12and made them the reality of this year
<Glacymr> 12if you can find a decent engine for gechamp
<Glacymr> 12it's not going to lose
<Kiara> mi bf says i should go to doc :P he crazy....
<Kiara> lol
<Proto> heh
<Kiara> *can't go til next month
<Proto> :(
<Theguesst> Did anyone catch what I said?

<[TST]Bot> -!- Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion| |Kdo Giasu: Hangyaku no Rurshu, often referred to as simply Code Geass, is a Japanese anime series created by Sunrise, directed by Gor Taniguchi, and written by Ichir kouchi, with original character designs by Clamp.
<Glacymr> 12oh anime
<Raine> small enough that i can hand feed it ^-^ but big enough for it to still survive ^-^
<Glacymr> 12i thought that name sounded familiar
<Brother> interesting story actually XD
<Brother> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf6XRk4DmEI
<Glacymr> 12no
<Spyrorocks> what if you accidently stepped on it?
<Brother> well semi interesting, to be fair
<Glacymr> 12lol
<Raine> i won't i'm used to taking care of baby bunnies that are found in the neighbor hood that the mom's abandoned
<Brother> at the beginning a bit slow
<Brother> though near the end it gets at its best
<Chimera> Meow :
<Aurora> the fact that I'm using IRC on my new mac is quite amusing
<Aurora> considering it's supposed to be incompatible :P
<Aurora> and yet the chat is dead
<Glacymr> 12ol
<Glacymr> 12you got a mac Aurora?
<Lugianite> 2ewwww Mac
<Lugianite> 2!mac
*Anatisha sits back with her coke and watchs the crickets
<Lugianite> 2!apple
<drf|away> 12EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW ITUNES
<Glacymr> 12Aurora
<Glacymr> 12IRC is compatible with Mac
<Glacymr> 12just not some of the clients like mIRC
<Aurora> well even the IRC site says not compatible
<Aurora> but I have crossover, so wheeee
<Glacymr> 12you read wrong then 8D
<Aurora> I've got paint sai working, IRC (but i'll need the IRC from my other computer first)
<Aurora> no I didn't lol
<Glacymr> 12then whoever posted that page mistyped
<Aurora> http://www.mirc.com/help/mac.html
<Aurora> first line lol
<Glacymr> 12you said IRC
<Glacymr> 12not mIRC
<Aurora> ...
<Aurora> where the heck did my "m" go in that forst line...
<Aristeo> Hehe
<Aurora> first
<Aurora> dfhjdf
*Aristeo watches with Anatisha
<Glacymr> 12don't you mean the "m" in all those lines XD
<Aurora> well, I usually say IRC
<Aurora> but I meant to say mIRC the first time to be specific
<Lugianite> 2*mIRC
<Aurora> guess my fingers didn't get the memo
<Lugianite> 2or they did and ignored it
<Glacymr> 12i'd get a mac
<Aurora> correction: I've got mIRC installed now :>
<Glacymr> 12but i'd quickly install windows on it afterwords XD
<Lugianite> 2lol
<Aurora> yeah I was going to install windows right away
<Aurora> but crossover works just as well
<Aurora> as I only would have wanted the programs
<Lugianite> 2Mac OS sucks
<Glacymr> 12you never know when you'll become a gamer Aurora :P
<Aurora> wut
<Glacymr> 12then you are going to need windows
<Aurora> not much of a gamer anymore
<Aurora> never was much of a computer gamer
<Glacymr> 12i agree
<Glacymr> 12platform gaming is so much more fun
<Glacymr> 12like with the 3DS
<Aurora> which I'm on the fence about
<Glacymr> 12try to get a computer to replicate that
*Glacymr breaks the fence
<Aurora> I'm dead excited for it, but I'm also scared of the price it'll be
<Glacymr> 12it won't be higher than 200
<Aurora> well then I might get it
<Aurora> because DSi is already close to that
<Glacymr> 12Aurora
<Glacymr> 12the problem is nintendo are marketing wizards
<Aurora> yeah >_>
<Glacymr> 12they purposely keep the supply low with stores
<Glacymr> 12so the demand stays high
<Glacymr> 12so getting one will be close to impossible
<Aurora> hmm....I'll transfer all my files to this computer tomorrow
<Aurora> I'm so tired...
<Aurora> I went to bed at midnight
<Aurora> and for the most bizarre reason woke up at 5
<Aurora> and couldn't for the life of me go back to sleep
<Glacymr> 12hah
<Glacymr> 12i've done the samething
<Glacymr> 12except with 3 and 4 AM
*Aristeo mews
<Aurora> ugh I did that once
<Glacymr> 12heh
<Aurora> anyways
<Aurora> I'm beat
<Glacymr> 12go sleep now
<Glacymr> 12or kyu will get you
<Aurora> I'll deal with computer stuff tomorrow
<Aurora> ....why o-o;
*Glacymr shrugs
<Aurora> lol
<Glacymr> 12i'm just trying to scare yo
<Glacymr> 12u
<Aurora> well then
<Glacymr> 12night
<Aurora> I'll be taking my leve
<Aurora> leave
<Aurora> dfugdi

<Drake> 04heya Shiny
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Hey
*Drake goes back to playing Raze
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02mmk
<PokemonStar> 13Shiny~
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Pokestar~
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02What are you doing up so late?
<PokemonStar> 13._.
<PokemonStar> 13It's only midnight
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I know, but you usually are off by 10 or 11
*Drake sits on Pokemonstar
<Drake> 04Hiya
<PokemonStar> 13No, midnight is my usually, meaning I don't have lots of time
<PokemonStar> 13I finished page 2, btw
*PokemonStar 13pushes Lyon off her
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Hurray~
*Drake is pushed off
*Shiny-Growlithe crawls under Pokestar
*PokemonStar 13sleeps on Shiny
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02:3
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02You getting tired?
<PokemonStar> 13Somewhat
<PokemonStar> 13I'll have to yard work tommorrow, then pack, then I leave for Wyoming.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02D:
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02You should come to the other state with W
<PokemonStar> 13I know, but I don't have family there. Besides, you aren't having your 50th wedding anniverisary this year?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02No, but a couple years ago my grandparents were .-.
<PokemonStar> 13Heh, timing
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Besides, there's no stopping from coming out here for vacation or anything
<PokemonStar> 13Anyway, I wish I could but I can't. But I'm excited for this trip, because its the first time we're bringing our dog with us :3
<PokemonStar> 13But, what are the chances that we'd meet up, Shiny? xD
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Hmm
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Not very good
<PokemonStar> 13See? It would be worse to know that I'm instate but we couldn't meet :/
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Depending where you guys go
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I mean...I'm guessing the first thing that pops into people's heads when someone says going to Wisconsin for vacation would be "Why would anyone want to go there?" XD
<PokemonStar> 13:/
<PokemonStar> 13My town isn't exactly what you would call a popular vacationing spot for Californians
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Not the point
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02At least there are people who like going to your state for vacation
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Heck, I LIVE in Wisconsin, the first reason I think of when I say vacation here is cows
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Next would be the Wisconsin Dells
<PokemonStar> 13Wisconsin Dells?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02It's like...one of the greatest water park centrals in America I believe
<PokemonStar> 13Sorry, heh, never heard of it ^^;;
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Again
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02That's probably why people would say "Why would we ever want to go there?"
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Ah speaking of Wisconsin Dells...
<PokemonStar> 13Hmm?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02We'll be going there in a few weeks
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Coz my other cousin from...another state...is coming to visit
<PokemonStar> 13Heh, all my cousins are in Wyoming or Colorado
<PokemonStar> 13http://i45.tinypic.com/sw8zki.jpg
<PokemonStar> 13I need to know what season it is to finish the last box
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Hmm...summer sounds good to me .-.
<PokemonStar> 13xD
<PokemonStar> 13Would that be Time of Running Prey or Time of no Sun?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Running Prey
<PokemonStar> 13K
<PokemonStar> 13Btw, what's winter called again? Time of Frozen Waters?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Time of No Sun
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Because winter there is hardly any sun
<PokemonStar> 13So there's only two seasons?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02For ArcticSun yes
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02And I feel like drawing them
<PokemonStar> 13What about Fall? Would that fall into Running Prey (even though its cold) or No Sun (but there is Sun)?
*PokemonStar 13pokes Shiny to draw them
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Um...naturally winter in very far north places have snow all the time and only summer/spring for about 2 weeks or something .0.
<PokemonStar> 13Yeah...
<PokemonStar> 13But No Sun only occurs for a short time in the cold season, what do we call those extra days?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02...
*Shiny-Growlithe gets out his notebook
*Drake yawns
<Drake> 04meh
<Drake> 04finished playing Raze
<PokemonStar> 13This would be like Mid August- November
<Drake> 04it's so very Halo-like
<PokemonStar> 13Cool
<Shiny-Growlithe> 023 seasons
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Time of No Sun, Time of Frozen Grass, Time of Runing Prey
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02That's what I have written down
<PokemonStar> 13Okay
<PokemonStar> 13I remember that
<PokemonStar> 13Now I gtg :<
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Aww D:

<drf|work> how so
<drf|work> that's just a bunch of comic characters
<drf|work> they're hand-drawn so it's not illegal :
<drf|work> *:P
<TimeShift> yeah, but can you count who got the trademark on them?
<eXAKR> TimeShift  http://gallery.gajus-tempus.de/data/media/6/Worlds_Biggest_Trademark_Violation.jpg <- I don't even know where to begin

<TimeShift> you'll notice: The title is NEVER said entirely - therefore they couldn't be sued :)
<drf|work> ...
<drf|work> you can't sue yourself for your own movie
<drf|work> so that's obviously not why
<eXAKR> ...
<drf|work> :O
<drf|work> http://friendsofirony.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/129096058595945561.jpg?w=500&h=375 <-- My friend sent me that picture
<drf|work> how did they get it?
<TimeShift> well, Harry Potter was produced by Warner, Monsters Inc. by Disney Pixar
<eXAKR> lawl at the trailer
<TimeShift> therefore they COULD sue the other
<drf|work> yeah but saying Monsters Inc in a trailer for Monsters Inc...

<TimeShift> By using Windows Server Update Services, administrators can manage the distribution of Microsoft hotfixes and updates released through Automatic Updates to computers in a corporate environment.
<drf|work> hm
<drf|work> I don't think we have that set up
<drf|work> though we do have like, bootleg versions of software
*drf|work hides
<drf|work> I was looking on the Software folder in the network drive
<drf|work> spotted a couple keygens
<drf|work> even got flagged as viruses >_>
<TimeShift> ...
<drf|work> most antivirus is retarded
<drf|work> it flags pirated material as viruses for legal reasons
<drf|work> when in reality most keygens are harmelss
<drf|work> ...LOL wtf
<drf|work> "Downloading 9 updates: 131KB, 25% complete"
<drf|work> Those updates are less than 1MB total?
*drf|work stabs the LAN, go faster

<drf|work> !twilight
<drf|away> VAMPIRES
<drf|away> DO
<drf|away> NOT
<drf|away> SPARKLE
<TimeShift> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgyVhaaVrw&feature=related
<drf|work> eh
<drf|work> not really in the mood to watch a video about it
<drf|work> whatever the case is, I'm just doing it manually
<drf|work> http://friendsofirony.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/129056569656350354.jpg
<TimeShift> advantages: You SEE on ONE CONSOLE which computer has which patches and is in which group
<drf|work> well the thing is all our computers have different OSes
<drf|work> some have XP, some have Windows 7 x86, some have 7 x64, some have 7 Enterprise oen or the other, some have Linux, etc
<TimeShift> and?
<drf|work> so it's not like you can just shove updates on there
<TimeShift> I don't see the problem
<drf|work> XP has different updates from 7
<TimeShift> still don't see the problem
<drf|work> as do the x86 and x64 versions
<drf|work> o.o
<drf|work> whatever
<drf|work> this computer isn't even on the domain yet
<drf|work> as my boss didn't give me admin rights
<drf|work> so I have to get him to do it
<TimeShift> well, if you had read what I posted you'd know: WSUS supports ALL Windows versions - from Windows 98 through Windows Datacenter Server 2k8
<drf|work> didn't Windows 7 come out after Server 2008?
<TimeShift> Windows 7 and Windows Server 2k8 have the same Kernel architecture
<drf|work> oh
<TimeShift> that's why the Service Pack 1 for Win7 will be released together with the Service Pack for Server 2008 - they're almost the same
<TimeShift> but yes, Win7 is also supported by the Service
<drf|work> o.o they announced a 7 SP1?
<TimeShift> of course. You can download a Beta since about a month
<drf|work> wtf is the point of a beta service pack?
<TimeShift> for developers?
<drf|work> o.o
<drf|work> sigh, I love when Windows Update freezes
<drf|work> this is why you shouldn't install like 200 updates in one day LOL
<TimeShift> that's what a beta is for - so big developers like those for Antivirus Software or hardware driver developers can fit their software for the future service pack
<Airwolve> how do you think game devs can make games for consoles that aren't released? the same way as this, they release betas with the same functionality
<TimeShift> and that's why you should use WSUS instead. If a computer's registered in the domain, you can monitor and administrate it through the console, knowing exactly which computer has which patch and is allowed which patch
<drf|work> well I just freshly installed Windows on it yesterday
<drf|work> then opened Windows Update and hit install all
<drf|work> big mistake I guess LOL
<drf|work> as it overloaded it, it's frozen a few times when downloading
<eXAKR> http://friendsofirony.com/2010/05/08/ironic-photos-would-have-thought-prepared/
<TimeShift> it not frozen, it's just too busy :P
<drf|work> XD
<drf|work> still, it's just taking ages to download the updates
<drf|work> I think the network's being overloaded or something, usually the internet here is fast

<TimeShift> hrm - am I too rude for a support ticket?^^
<Aurora> LOL
<TimeShift> as this PHP file is causing the SAME hassle like ALL OTHER pages I suggest you failed in configuring the PHP module correct for the server. Therefore I summon you to fix that error ASAP - preferably yesterday.
<TimeShift> If you see yourself UNABLE to apply a fix so this PHP file is prompted correctly (which any even free host should be able to do - this is the LEAST I demand from you!) I see you not fulfilling your service and ultimately request to IMMEDIATELY back-out to the previous configuration. It's not my problem HOW you do it, but DO IT NOW!
<TimeShift> Furthermore I set you in default by now!
<Proto> heh
<Aurora> I saw the funniest hampster at petsmart
<drf|work> LOL hampster
<Kiara> have to make college admissions essay
<Aurora> -p
<Aurora> it was like a walking cottonball

<Steve> 12 Hello, Lancer232 and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<TimeShift> hey, is it my fault your server is responding with swearing words if it's ask for explanation of common phrases on the net?
<TimeShift> he could have answered "shut the f-word up" instead
<drf|work> for intentionally defining things that have swear words in them, absolutely
<drf|work> ...
<drf|work> it just uses google
<TimeShift> !define miserable failure
<[TST]Bot> -!- During the 2004 U.S. presidential election, Google bombs were used to further various political agendas. Two of the first were the "miserable failure" Google bomb linked to George W. Bush's White House biography and the "waffles" Google bomb linked to John Kerry's website. ...

<Lyalia> TimeShift that was a bit silly
<Lyalia> o.O
<TimeShift> eh?
<TimeShift> what are you talking about?
<Lyalia> Oh egh
<Lyalia> I was about to say something
<Lyalia> but then I forgot what I was about to follow it up with!
<Lyalia> Sorry x.x
<TimeShift> d'oh
<Lyalia> How are you though+
<Lyalia> ?
<TimeShift> been kinda good til now....but now I see there's a new Twilight movie coming out....

<TimeShift> by the way - it seems this Cyberhost Pro-company is a small one-person-shebeen....
<Aurora> ugh ok...do I have to pay for windows OS?
<TimeShift> of course
<Aurora> how much
<TimeShift> depends on what you want to do
<TimeShift> and what you want to have
<Aurora> honestly, something that will get my art program running like it should
<eXAKR> http://thereifixedit.com/2010/05/13/epic-kludge-photo-more-refreshing-than-recycled-air-at-least
<TimeShift> around 80 dollars for a System Builder version of Win 7 Home Premium 32Bit ?
<Aurora> windows xp
<TimeShift> XP is not for sale anymore
<Aurora> fffff
<TimeShift> well, XP is 8 years old right now
<Aurora> I know
<TimeShift> have you any idea how old that is in software-years?
<Aurora> I really just don't want to deal with this right now
<Aurora> really depressed me
<TimeShift> I thought you got a fancy Mac now :P
<TimeShift> why you're asking for Windows then?^^
<Aurora> I want people to shut up about this ok?
<Aurora> I didn't ASK for it
<Aurora> my parents just up and bought me one
<Aurora> and i'm sorry for being the one who's too nice to say no
<TimeShift> take it and swap it for a real computer then^^
<Aurora> ...
<Aurora> I love how understanding you lot are
<Aurora> >_>
*TimeShift cuddles Aurora
<Aurora> I CAN'T swap it, it would hurt their feelings
<TimeShift> and you think it won't if you just put it into a corner, unable to use it like you want and smile over it?
<Aurora> I'm not going to put it in a corner
<Aurora> my old laptop is pretty much useless for now
<Aurora> virus wont go away
<Aurora> and it needs to be completely erased
<Aurora> my dad didn't do it the first time because he had bought me a new one that was being shipped to me
<Aurora> but my parents are gone for 2 weeks, so I'd be without a computer for that long
<TimeShift> wish I was living closer to you. I'd fix your notebook within just a matter of hours^^
<Aurora> see that's just it...I don't want to say "oh thanks for the laptop that was more expensive than my car. I'm actually just going to leave it here and use the old crap I've had for 2 years"
<Aurora> once my dad gets home, he does still owe me a serial number for a legit photoshop
<Aurora> but I still want my old program...
<TimeShift> unfortunately, not all windows software will run on a Mac
<TimeShift> not even on a virtual machine
<Lyalia> Hey
<Aurora> yeah so I've seen
<Aurora> it runs, but wont combine the tablet with the program
<TimeShift> that's why there's a Wintel-Universe and a Mac-Universe
<Aurora> again, yes I know
<TimeShift> still, if you have any problems, I'll do my best and help you
<TimeShift> so, which program are you trying to install?
<Aurora> Paint Sai IS installed
<Aurora> usable via CrossOver
<Aurora> but wont recognize my tablet
<Aurora> which is a widely seen problem, according to the numbers of people on google asking for help
<Aurora> -_-;
<Espeon> Also hey to Lyalia
<TimeShift> ....k, did you take a look at the Apple support forums then? Maybe those guys know a solution
<TimeShift> maybe you just need to install specific drivers?
<TimeShift> did you go to the tablet's manufacturer website and look for Mac drivers there?
<Aurora> it works just fine on a mac
<Aurora> but combining the two doesnt seem possible
<TimeShift> so did my Bamboo on Windows 7 - but it was just a mouse. Additional functionality was only added when I istalled the drivers
<TimeShift> so that's what I'd recommend here
<TimeShift> give it a try - what can you loose?
<Aurora> which drivers?
<Aurora> maaaaaaan this is frustrating
<TimeShift> for the tablet?
<Aurora> I just need this all to be transferred and settles
<Aurora> settled
<Aurora> and I'll be fine
<Aurora> it's just getting there that's the problem
<TimeShift> whilst the first step is the hardest and the last step reaches the target, the steps in between those two are the best of all
<TimeShift> as for with each step you learn, see new things and grow by doing them
<Aurora> well that didn't work
<Aurora> lets see....
<Aurora> oh
<Aurora> I also need drf's portable irc
<Aurora> I forgot this one is unregistered
<TimeShift> I saw it by the font colour :P
<Aurora> yeh
<eXAKR> http://failblog.org/2010/06/22/epic-fail-photos-product-fail-spree/ <- What is this I don't even.
<Aurora> welll.......
<Aurora> even GIMP doesn't recognize the tablet...
<Aurora> very interesting
<TimeShift> indeed looks like a problem with the driver
<TimeShift> may I ask for the model name?
<TimeShift> I'll try and help you searching then :)
<Aurora> 6lets see
<Aurora> 6CTE-450 bamboo fun
<Aurora> 6I dunno why the driver would just up and not work
<Aurora> 6unless it takes issue with macs too
<Aurora> 6but even then I don't understand, because it worked fine on the macs at school
<TimeShift> you downloaded and installed it already?
<Aurora> 6yes
<Aurora> 6I installed the tablet last night
<Aurora> 6and reinstalled the driver when you mentioned it
<TimeShift> with the current drivers from the website?
<TimeShift> tried these her? http://www.wacom.com/downloads/driver-detail.php?id=202
<Aurora> 6yeh I tried the them
<TimeShift> after you've installed the drivers, try plugging the tablet out and back in
<Aurora> 6did that too
<TimeShift> even on another USB port?
<Aurora> 6yup
<Aurora> 6once photoshop gets installed, we'll see if it's not just the programs having problems
<TimeShift> as far as I read, Photoshop seems to also have that kind of problems
<Aurora> 6yes but it worked at school
<Aurora> 6so if it works here, then it's not the tablet
<TimeShift> ...
<TimeShift> and again my cat's sitting on my lap

<TimeShift> I'll see what I can do
<Articuno> 12Because if Im testing hosts out, I will not have time before my contract runs out
<drf|work> you could probably put it onb ayleef too if you want
<drf|work> I don't think usotsuki minds
<drf|work> since we already have the database stuff installed

<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Thanks Azure :>
<TimeShift> these two points:

<TimeShift> FREE comprehensive 24/7 support

<drf|work> until it goes down and they say "whoops"
<Arcanine> 04*spam
<drf|work> and they all have support too, LOL
<TimeShift> there's a difference between 99%, 99.9% and 99.99%
<drf|work> still
<drf|work> guaranteed really means nothing
<drf|work> it can still randomly die for 3 days
<Espeon> call it wishfull thinking
<TimeShift> well, 99% means a page can be down for 3 days 15 hours and 36 minutes of downtime per year
*Quilava squeaks very late
<TimeShift> 99.9% means 8 hours and 45 minutes of downtime per year
<drf|work> yes, but guarantees are pointless when *their servers go down*
<drf|work> it's all just statistics IMO
<Espeon> You missed an orgy the size of Mexico City
<Espeon> or well not really
<TimeShift> nope, they are not

<Lugia365> 12LOLwtf
<Altair> in addition to another computer
<drf|work> so why spend more money than is needed on a crappy computeR?
<drf|work> when you can get a better one for like half>?
<Proto> Hey Aristeo
<Altair> basically because i don't need two laptops
<Altair> that are the exact same
<drf|work> so why not just go find the one you have/
<Aristeo> Hey Proto!
<Altair> because it was made 5 years ago? :P
<Espeon> lol
<carrington> hey red dragon u come here often
<drf|work> and it's probably 3x as good as a current macbook?
<drf|work> me runs
<drf|work> */me
<Altair> XD
<Altair> i'm getting a normal laptop anyway, i'm just getting this because that $1200 cannot be used on anything else
<Lugia365> 12lol
<drf|work> what do you mean "on anything else"
<Altair> it can only be spent on a laptop
<Altair> insuranc
<Altair> e
<drf|work> yeah but you can easily get a better laptop for $1200
<drf|work> like, with a quad core and some decent RAM, etxc
<drf|work> -x
<Nyte> hi hi Chris
<drf|work> maybe a Blu-Ray drive
<Altair> i am
<drf|work> so then why mention Macs?
<Altair> [3:36:02 pm] <Altair> in addition to another computer
<Altair> one i'm going to spend on a PC, the other i (might) spend on a mac
<drf|work> yeah but why waste money at all?
<drf|work> just keep it for something else
<Altair> i cant... lol
<drf|work> your parents are letting you buy two computers and only computers?
<Altair> otherwise i would, but i don't really have an option
<Altair> read lo
<Altair> [3:38:06 pm] <Altair> insurance
<drf|work> insurance is paying for two computers?
<Altair> ok let me rewind, we had a fire
<drf|work> yes I heard
<Altair> one is gone, the other is not working properly
<Altair> yes basically
<Altair> we *have* to buy laptops with the money, which is kinda silly but eh
<drf|work> so get a desktop and a lap...what?

<Arcanine> 04but playing him gives me a massive headache
<Quilava> why?
<Arcanine> 04well TF is about being hard hitting
<Arcanine> 04you know what stacked deck and pick a card does right?
<Quilava> yes
<Arcanine> 04basically early game the strategy is to setup stacked deck so the next attack does the bonus damage
<Arcanine> 04then pick a card and get red, then hit the champion
<Arcanine> 04then if you get lucky ignite them
<Spyrorocks> Im out, will be back later.
<Quilava> honestly ignite is only really useful in the beginning of the game, lol
<Arcanine> 04well yeah
<Quilava> its how I tend to get my early kills
<Arcanine> 04it's supposed to be how you get first blood
<Arcanine> 04if they run
<Arcanine> 04you flash over to them and finish them of
<Arcanine> 04f
<Quilava> I use ignite/teleport
<Arcanine> 04tf almost needs flash
<Quilava> destiny does the same thing, but with unlimited range
<Quilava> and its not quite instant
<Arcanine> 04flash just helps you get some distance after you destiny
<Arcanine> 04or escape if things didn't quite go as planned
<Quilava> I have rocet jump for that
<Arcanine> 04TF doesn't have rocket jump XD
<Arcanine> 04anyway i'm trying to learn TF
<Quilava> WELL HE SHOULD HAVE IT D:<
<Arcanine> 04he's so hard to play late game though
<Arcanine> 04you have so much attack speed that it's hard to keep the deck stacked at 3 for your kills
<Quilava> I usually would use yellow cards instead
<Arcanine> 04yellow is great for ganks
<Quilava> especially later in the game
<Arcanine> 04red is great for farming and damage
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I misread ganks
*LugiaLordOfTheSeas shot
<Altair> lol
<Arcanine> 04Altair
<Altair> Arcanine
<Arcanine> 04there is a character in this game with martydom
<Arcanine> 04literally XD
<Altair> :D
<Sneas> 03ur
<Arcanine> 04actually Quilava i played against him yesterday
<Arcanine> 04that ability is no fair
<Quilava> what about the ult that hits EVERY ENEMY CHAMPOIN
<Arcanine> 04the body actually runs around and chases you
<Quilava> *champion
<Quilava> oh, what
<Arcanine> 04after he dies
<Quilava> yeah that's not really fair
<Arcanine> 04the body just sort of squirms over to you FAST as heck
<Arcanine> 04not to mention it does a decent amount of damage as well
<Quilava> actually Anivia's passive is pretty good as well
<Arcanine> 04the egg thing?
<Arcanine> 04yeah
<Quilava> yeah. its like that armor thing
<Quilava> revives every now and then
<Arcanine> 04anivia can play really aggressive early game
<Arcanine> 04because that egg is hard to kill
<Quilava> yeah. but it doesn't fare so well in mobs
<Arcanine> 04well yeah

<Arcanine> 04mobbing is the only way
<Arcanine> 04or if you die in tower range XD
<Arcanine> 04the turret will easily kill you
<Quilava> yeahhh. but they always do that
<Quilava> unless you're a tank with your 3k health
<Arcanine> 04it'd be so easy for a tris
<Arcanine> 04to like rocket jump behind them
<Arcanine> 04then ulti them into the tower
<carrington> see ya later spyo rocks
<Quilava> that never happens. trust me
<Quilava> maybe against noobs, but still
<RedDragonX> 

<Quilava> a lot of them really suck to fight
<Quilava> like ashe's freaking ult
<Quilava> hate.
<Arcanine> 04his ult is so cheap though
<Arcanine> 04i'm just going to magically damage all you champions
<Arcanine> 04it's like the easiest ulti to get a double kill with
<Quilava> I'd say master yi's is pretty easy too.

<Arcanine> 04i'm thinking it's either going to be TF, Shaco, or Twitch
<Quilava> well.. yet
<Arcanine> 04probably shaco or twitch
<Arcanine> 04TF is headache
<Arcanine> 04it's like every 2 seconds you need to retreat and focus on pick a card

<Arcanine> 04i dunno
<Arcanine> 04i want a non-squishy as a secondary
<Quilava> loltank
<Arcanine> 04i thought cho'gath would work

<Aurora> 6kinda funny, I search "baseball" on google
<Aurora> 6one of the related searches is "lady gaga baseball"
<Brother|LP> when she was drunk? XD
<Aurora> 6apparently
<Aurora> 6but I never heard about that
<drfsupercenter> 03also
<drfsupercenter> 03Aurora
<drfsupercenter> 03http://graphjam.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/129151728717434904.png
<Brother|LP> the "News" talked about it
<Brother|LP> but then thats the "news"
<Aurora> 6UUUUUUUUGH JUSTIN BEIBER
*Aurora 6hisses
<drfsupercenter> 03thought you'd like laughing at that though :P
<Brother> Didnt he hit puberty or is he somehow still evading it?
<Sneas> 03Hi :3
<Aurora> 6my friend (who loves his music) and I went shopping yesterday
<Aurora> 6and we had to listen to it on the way up
<Aurora> 6and then we went into a store...where they had it playing
<J-Lugia> speaking of justing Beiber, yesterday I was watching a review of one of his latest collab songs, and guess what. He was wearing pink shirt, red belt, and lip stick
<Aurora> 6I was like "ffs REALLY?"
<Brother> "the justin beiber circle of hell"
<Aurora> 6^doesn't suprise
<Skylands> 10Hey Sneas :3
<Aurora> 6hard choice though
<Skylands> 10Pic related to Justin Bieber: http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/135/5/9/Justin_Bibarel_by_Cherrii_Yunie.jpg
<Aurora> 6Justin Beiber
<Aurora> 6or John mayer
<J-Lugia> didn't think it would. And damn, his voice is so horribly girly. Dang, if he had needed auto-tunning, I swear, I think he'd sound like Ke$ha
<Aurora> 6LOL SKYLANDS
<Brother> J: that reminds me of "MIM" talk XD
<Aurora> 6I remember making a joke about the same thing
<Aurora> 6...
<Skylands> 10He would look better as a Bibarel tbh
<J-Lugia> that's insulting to all Bibarel! D<
*Aurora 6never noted Ke$ha compared to bieber
*Aurora 6now notes the similarities
*Brother just notes of the funny MIM talk J made :O
<Arcanine> 04omg Quilava
<Arcanine> 04that boils me with rage
<Quilava> hm?
<Arcanine> 04when they destroy your nexus
<Arcanine> 04before you can even call a surrender
<Quilava> wow.
<Aurora> 6hmm...
<Quilava> were you doing the whole sit in the corner thing?
<Aurora> 6I might be needing to buy some new tablet nubbs...
<Arcanine> 04no
<Arcanine> 04but 3 of the players in our team were
<drfsupercenter> 03nubbds?
<drfsupercenter> 03-d
<Arcanine> 041 from the very start
<andrea> hey carie!
<Quilava> well there's nothing you can do about that
<Aurora> 6the tip of a tablet pen
<drfsupercenter> 03go buy a stylus LOL
<Cute_Riolu> Well, it gets them more points.
<Arcanine> 04i don't give enemies the honor of destroying the nexus
<Arcanine> 04that's my motto
<Aurora> 6meh
<Quilava> lol
<Aurora> 6are they expensive?
<andrea> what up/
<Aurora> 6pens are WAY expensive
<Arcanine> 04but of course if you cant call surrender before that happens
<Aurora> 6like...over half the tablet cost
<drfsupercenter> 03styluses are 3 for $5
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<drfsupercenter> 03like, the DS ones
<Aurora> 6...
<Aurora> 6um
<Arcanine> 04screw this
<drfsupercenter> 03you can even get like, Pokmon tipped ones
<drfsupercenter> 03for $10
<Arcanine> 04i need to find a tank character i can actually play good
<Aurora> 6tablet pens are way different than styluses
<drfsupercenter> 03orly?
<andrea> is spyro rocks on?
<Aurora> 6this isn't a touch tablet lol
<drfsupercenter> 03it's just plastic at the end, right?
<drfsupercenter> 03....
<drfsupercenter> 03wtf kind of a tablet do you have
<drfsupercenter> 03in the one I used it was just touch sensitive
<andrea> or prince-dari?
<drfsupercenter> 03and it was literally a stylus LOL
<Aurora> 6tbh, I've never heard of a touch tablet
<Arcanine> 04only question is
<Arcanine> 04who is a good tank
<Aurora> 6but it makes sense I guess
<drfsupercenter> 03the ones we had at camp were
<drfsupercenter> 03Wacom tablets
<Sneas> 03this pisses me off
<Brother> nice first episode here
<Aurora> 6^
<drfsupercenter> 03there was even a mouse you could put on it LOL
<Aurora> 6wacom bamboo fun
<drfsupercenter> 03erm
<Aurora> 6that's the kind I have
<Sneas> 03700 new emails mostly spam
<drfsupercenter> 03that was just a normal stylus o.o
<Aurora> 6my mouse is shoved in my drawer though
<drfsupercenter> 03you could touch it with your finger
<Aurora> 6...
<drfsupercenter> 03and it would move
<Quilava> try dr mundo?
<Aurora> 6oh well
<drfsupercenter> 03try it LOL
<Aurora> 6this one isn't touch
<drfsupercenter> 03try just using your finger
<drfsupercenter> 03on the ...wtf?
<Aurora> 6just did
<Aurora> 6the pen itself has sensors
<drfsupercenter> 03you got ripped off then LOL
<Arcanine> 04i don't own dr mundo lol
<Aurora> 6which is why they're like 60 bucks
<Aurora> 6not really
<drfsupercenter> 03I hate stupid overpriced crap like that
<Quilava> oh
<Arcanine> 04i've thought about trying to be good at Rummus but meh
<Aurora> 6it's really nice...I'd kill my fingers using a stylus tablet
<Aurora> 6unless they're like....super touche sensitive
<Aurora> 6...
<Aurora> 6*touch
<Quilava> lol last hits.
<Arcanine> 04what do you mean?
<drfsupercenter> 03it WAS super sensitive
<andrea> carrington!!
<Aurora> 6oh
<Aurora> 6whatever
<Quilava> syphoning strike?
<Arcanine> 04i just want a tank i can play good
<drfsupercenter> 03I accidentally bumped it and sent the mouse flying halfway across the screen >_>
<Aristeo> Hey Curly and Spyrorocks and Proto!
<Aurora> 6I love my tablet, never had a problem
<Quilava> ohwait
<drfsupercenter> 03it was such an annoyance, I was like "Who the frick actually LIKES these"
<Quilava> wrong guy lol
<drfsupercenter> 03it was so hard to use, as it was way TOO sensitive
<Arcanine> 04because a team of 5 squishies
<Aurora> 6except when I messed up the drivers once
<carrington> hey
<Quilava> thats the guy who sits near turrets and taunts
<Arcanine> 04does not make a good team
<Aurora> 6that's why i don't use the mouse
<andrea> heyyy
<Arcanine> 04yeah
<Arcanine> 04the armadillo
<Aurora> 6it responds just like the pen
<Quilava> you mean bowser clone?
<Arcanine> 04yes
<carrington> i want u to create a spyro forum member account
<Arcanine> 04[16:59:28] <Quilava> syphoning strike?
<Arcanine> 04you are thinking of lucario

<Aurora> 6dunno
<Curly> hi Ari ^^
<Aurora> 6i haven't bothered with the forums since they went down LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03http://www.drfsupercenter.info/cgiproxy/nph-proxy.pl/000000A/http/www.lugia.us/forum/
<drfsupercenter> 03that works for me
<Brother> a shame Pride only comes untill much later
<drfsupercenter> 03only the forum though
<Arcanine> 04i thought about playing him as well
<Arcanine> 04Cute_Riolu opinion please?
<carrington> ok ill be back in a sec
<Skylands> 10Hm
<Brother> like...32 wise we see him and maybe 38 wise we see his powers
<Skylands> 10Not working, drf
<Skylands> 10:/
<Aurora> 6skylands
<Aurora> 6it's working for me
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<Arcanine> 04who do you think is more annoying or higher tier
<drfsupercenter> 03it gives you a 404?
<Arcanine> 04Nassus or Bowser
<Skylands> 10Yeah
<Malefor> helo?
<Malefor> *Hello?
<Skylands> 10Want me to screenshot it?
<drfsupercenter> 03weird
<drfsupercenter> 03nah
<Brother> oh Kimbly is in the first episode..who knew
<Aurora> 6read that as Kirby, and I was like wtf
<Brother> XD yah kirby has become insane and killer like
<Aurora> 6well, we all know he has secrets >_>
<Brother> though it would be scary is Kimbly=Kirby o.o
<Aurora> 6all that pink puff....no
<Brother> the Crimsion pink pff Alchemist?
<Brother> *puff
<Aurora> 6dfjghdhfggor
<Aurora> 6headache
<Aurora> 6throbbing pain in my temple ._.
<Aurora> 6that was random
<Quilava> nassus is actually pretty easy to kill
<Quilava> he's just annoying in combination with people who can stun/slow you
<Brother> was it because of Justin Beiber? :P
<Arcanine> 04yeah i've played him a couple times
<Arcanine> 04Rummus seems to be hard to get kills with as well though
<Aurora> 6ugh
<Arcanine> 04or rather he's just plain hard to play
*Aurora 6burns him
<Quilava> taunt near a turret.
<Arcanine> 04usually they don't let you get close
<Brother> Man, they show alot of people in this first episode
<TimeShift> I'm currently working on the forum. That's why
<Quilava> no, near YOUR turret
<Arcanine> 04you have to power spin into them, then taunt them into the turret
<Quilava> oh.
<Quilava> yeah makes sense at least
<TimeShift> need to do MAJOR tweaks now
<Arcanine> 04because without it
<Arcanine> 04they will just stay out of your range
<Arcanine> 04and attack the turret from there
<Quilava> unless they're melee too.
<Aurora> 6major tweaks?
<TimeShift> www.lugia.us/forum
<Aurora> 6what happened, exactly?
<TimeShift> that link should work by now
<Arcanine> 04i wish i can well you know
<Arcanine> 04start the game with Nassus
<Arcanine> 04with Q having like a +4885002 boost or something XD
<Aurora> 6oh hey it does
<Quilava> just use it all the time on weak enemies
<TimeShift> looks like whatever they changed does conflict with some entries in the .htaccess-file and the url-translator we had installed
<Aurora> 6so does the main site
<Arcanine> 04mathmatically
<Arcanine> 04you should use his one ability spirit fire i think it is
<Aurora> 6ok just kidding
<Aurora> 6the main page of the main site does
<Aurora> 6content doesn't
<Arcanine> 04at rank 1 it does just enough damage so that you can one shot minions with Q
<Quilava> ah
<Skylands> 10Same with the forums, if you try accessing your profile, it won't work
<Arcanine> 04hmm
<Quilava> still that would require other minions to not kill them
<Arcanine> 04i haven't seen very many Amumus
<Aurora> 6mhmmhm
<Arcanine> 04maybe i should learn to play him XD
<TimeShift> profile will work - but not through this messy url
<Skylands> 10It appears there's no reason to get hopes up at this point, heh
<Brother> XD oh look even King Bradley is in here
<TimeShift> oh just cut it out, will ya?
<Arcanine> 04that's what i'll do XD
<Arcanine> 04he has fantastic health
<TimeShift> we just found the problem and all I need is a bit time to get used to this pile of mess and get things sorted. If you just wait an hour or so so I can figure out where I need to tweak what everything should bein apple pie order
<Arcanine> 04and his abilities are annoying
<Skylands> 10...
<Aurora> 6TimeShift, no hurry. I can't even imagine how jumbled that would make my brain lol
<Sneas> 03bbs
<Arcanine> 04http://www.leaguecraft.com/skins/57,Spider+Man+by+Madrox
<Arcanine> 04LOL
<J-Lugia> good night, LLOTS!
<LugiaLordOfTheZzzs> meh night
<Quilava> I hate anything that stuns.
<TimeShift> k, a few links fixed, PLENTY more to go
<Brother> oh so thats its name; Ouroboros
<TimeShift> the switch to another server really messed up almost MOST of the links oO
<Arcanine> 04Quilava i agree
<Arcanine> 04stuns are so cowardly D:
<Arcanine> 04why does Amumu have so many funny skins
<Aurora> 6O-O
<Arcanine> 04http://www.leaguecraft.com/skins/756,IronMumu+%28+Ironman+%2B+Amumu+%29+V1.1
<Quilava> they're cheap too
<Quilava> especially considering when they're LONG stuns
<Arcanine> 04i'm referring to the customs
<Arcanine> 04oh stuns
<Quilava> like.. 5s long ones
<Arcanine> 04many things about LoL is cheap
<Arcanine> 04stuns
<Arcanine> 04some ultimates are unfair
<Quilava> mine looks worthless compared to most others :(
<Quilava> sure it hits hard.. but so does every single other one
<Arcanine> 04honestly if you ask me Quilava
<Arcanine> 04i don't think destiny should have a teleport option
<Arcanine> 04knowing where they all are is already such a huge advantage
<Quilava> still
<Quilava> same with pantheon though. he teleports and attacks for lots of damage
<AeroDracohem> oAo for some reason it says my session timed out when I try to post
<Arcanine> 04at least Pantheon
<AeroDracohem> even though I just clicked on the button to post
<Arcanine> 04his teleport becomes so obvious and gives you lots of time to escape
<Aurora> 6lol
<Quilava> you can see twisted fate's cards before he warps
<Quilava> and I never have enough time to escape >.>
<AeroDracohem> I wasn't lingering on the 'post reply' thing either
<Aurora> 6ok so...I should go now
<AeroDracohem> D: bye Roara~
<Aurora> 6actually no, I should get my music all sorted
<Arcanine> 04i escape every once in awhile
<AeroDracohem> XD
<Arcanine> 04you can see TF's cards as well
<Quilava> I only do if I rocket jump at the exact moment as it starts
<Arcanine> 04but the thing is is that it's usually goes by so fast
<Aurora> 6this'll only take forever
<TimeShift> posting works for me
<Aurora> 6woah
<Aurora> 6that actually went really fast...
<Quilava> :/
<Articuno> 12zzzz
<Aurora> 6my old computer would have taken eons to work
<Articuno> 12Lugia and Andrew have only JUST left :3
<Aurora> 6Arti
<Aurora> 6~
<AeroDracohem> Heya Arti~ :D
<Andrew> :D
<Articuno> 12Awesome night, wish Xai was there
<Articuno> 12WOAH
<Articuno> 12LOOOOOL
<Articuno> 12YOU'RE HOME ALREADY LMAO
<Andrew> YA
<Aurora> 6lOL
<AeroDracohem> XD
<Andrew> that was a fun evening thanks arti ^^
<Articuno> 12LOL in the time it took me to put the dishes in the dishwasher XD
<Articuno> 12^v^ no prob, thanks for the lift
<Aurora> 6wait
<Aurora> 6yall had the meet already?
<Articuno> 12No
<Articuno> 12XD
<Articuno> 12Just Lugia and Andrew were here
<Aurora> 6oh LOL
<Andrew> Aurora - i live near arti
<Articuno> 12...
<Articuno> 12TST is working ovO
<Andrew> O_O
<Aurora> 6Arti, some of it
<Andrew> awesome!
<Articuno> 12Oh great :/
<Aurora> 6TimeShift has gotten some of it to work
<Articuno> 12Wow
<Articuno> 12Hi
<Articuno> 12we did some tests and tempory renamed your htaccess to htaccessold this then allowed your site to be loaded, we changed the filename back incase anything was required backend wise that we may of broken etc, its something in your htaccess causing this that is not compatable with litespeed.
<Articuno> 12God the guy can't even spell, that's pathetic
<Aurora> 6TimeShift	we just found the problem and all I need is a bit time to get used to this pile of mess and get things sorted. If you just wait an hour or so so I can figure out where I need to tweak what everything should bein apple pie order
<TimeShift> looks like openNEF ENTIRELY messed up everything
<Aurora> 6err
<Aurora> 6copypaste fail
<Articuno> 12I mean at work when we write our support tickets we make sure to use proper spelling and punctuation....
<Aurora> 6that was TimeShift's line
<Articuno> 12LOOOOOL
<Kiara> hey Aristeo
<Arcanine> 04pantheon i notice the circle rather easily
<Articuno> 12Great :/ my short urls aren't working
<Arcanine> 04pantheon is so mean
<Quilava> I just can't react in time I guess
<Quilava> that or my ping kills me
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03what short URLs?
<drfsupercenter> 03the site appears to be working fine now
<Arcanine> 04my reflexes are horrible
<Articuno> 12http://lugia.us/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=40&Itemid=112
<Articuno> 12http://lugia.us/about-me.htm
<Arcanine> 04in shooter games
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah it 404s
<Arcanine> 04i usually die by grenades a lot
<drfsupercenter> 03I thought you meant like /forum which works
<Arcanine> 04my reflexes are that bad XD
<junh1024-XDCC> oh yeah
<junh1024-XDCC> umm arti,
<junh1024-XDCC> do you know what "SQL" is?
<Articuno> 12I cannot believe htaccess can cause so much hassle
<Articuno> 12Of course I do Ovo;;;;;
<Articuno> 12I use it every day
<Articuno> 12At work
<Quilava> oheytstorm
<Articuno> 12and on TST
<junh1024-XDCC> because when you said lunar has a "crappy SQL connection"
<Quilava> I'd be more likely to not notice till I'm dead
<Arcanine> !weather 54650
<Articuno> 12MySQL I said, and it does
<junh1024-XDCC> that doesn't really make sense?
<Arcanine> 04you know what i hate most
<drfsupercenter> 03lunamr?
<Articuno> 12Connection from pages to Mysql databases
<drfsupercenter> 03-m
<Arcanine> 04is when you are in a gigantic crowd
<Articuno> 12It's too slow, same with most "all you can eat" hosts
<junh1024-XDCC> oh
<drfsupercenter> 03all you can eat hosts are awesome for just plain data XD
<Articuno> 12Yes
<TimeShift> k, top bar is fixed
<Articuno> 12Agreed
<Arcanine> 04i can never piece together what the heck is going on lol
<drfsupercenter> 03I still love how I got a Dreamhost account for $9 for an entire year
<Quilava> I just activate rapid fire and pick a champion to shoot
<Quilava> and if my HP gets low, jump away
<Articuno> 12But when you have static pages, unless you host media, you don't really need all that space..
<drfsupercenter> 03I even run like, torrents off it LOL
<Quilava> or if I notice someone weak, kill them
<drfsupercenter> 03I gave myself SSH access :)
<Arcanine> 04rocket jump is too good
<drfsupercenter> 03no duh, of course I host media
<drfsupercenter> 03I have gigs of music, videos, pirated warez, etc etc on there
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Articuno> 12Yeh but most people don't
<Arcanine> 04offensive, defensive doesn't matter
<Articuno> 12They just host their personal website or whatever
<Quilava> I have a hard time hitting with it
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL that's so lame
<drfsupercenter> 03www.drfsupercenter.ath.cx <-- personal website
<drfsupercenter> 03why would anyone pay for that?
<drfsupercenter> 03besides a domain name?
<TimeShift> lugia.us/forum is mostly fixed now. All Arti needs to do is fix the Gallery preview in the footer
<Arcanine> 04i know what you mean
<drfsupercenter> 03I think the point of having unlimited bandwidth is to use it XD
<TimeShift> but I think that's just a small tweak on the source file to modify the web address contained
<Arcanine> 04http://www.leaguecraft.com/skins/278,Sonic+the+Hedgehog+by+Jamesio
<Arcanine> 04lol
<Arcanine> 04fail
<Aurora> 6Korean HTTYD poster is awesome
<Articuno> 12We're not supposed to use /forum though :/
<Articuno> 12It's supposed to be http://lugia.us/component/option,com_smf/Itemid,129/
<Aristeo> :o
<Aristeo> Hey Kiara!
<Aristeo> When did you come on here? :o
<Aristeo> You snuck on!
<Aristeo> :D
*Aristeo didn't see
<junh1024-XDCC> hey so arti, you bought all the pokemon soundtracks from japan?
<TimeShift> I just wonder why
<drfsupercenter> 03<Articuno> We're not supposed to use /forum though :/ <-- why?
<Articuno> 12No haha
<drfsupercenter> 03I always use it and never had any problems
<Airwolve> http://fukung.net/v/843/060410_hair.jpg
<TimeShift> same - plus this /component/...is as intuitive as a fusion reactor :P
<Articuno> 12DRF I told you why before, you agreed, Im not explaining again, it has taken me many years of work on TST to come to that decision
<Quilava> :|
<drfsupercenter> 03isn't that technically the host's problem? :P
<Articuno> 12No
<Articuno> 12It's actually the bridge between the forum and the main site
<drfsupercenter> 03so you just failed in writing the site? LOL
<Articuno> 12I didn't write the bridge
<Articuno> 12It's a bit of software
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<Steve> 12 Hello, InfamousZed and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Aristeo> Kiara: How's you?
<Kiara> :P
<drfsupercenter> 03still, I don't see why you should tell people to use one or the other, they both work fine 99.9% of the time
<drfsupercenter> 03and you could just make /forum redirect to the long one if you're that concerned
<Kiara> i good
<Articuno> 12No they don't ok?
<drfsupercenter> 03or better yet, iframe it
<drfsupercenter> 03if it doesn't work than how come I have never had a single problem with it?
<Articuno> 12You dont see why because you haven't worked on the site backend
<Articuno> 12So don't question me
<drfsupercenter> 03and for that matter my proxy was the only thing that actually worked for a while :P
<drfsupercenter> 03with the short one
<Articuno> 12Thats nice
<drfsupercenter> 03so it's not that broken IMO
<TimeShift> anyways - the page is working atm. - the essential things at least
<Kiara> u?
<Articuno> 12I can't login
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway Articuno, if you want to force people into using the long URL, just iframe it inside the short one
<Articuno> 12Hold on, it'sok now
<Articuno> 12I don;t think I can move the site over easily unless I try tomorrow night
<Articuno> 12So apparently this litespeed is so much better than apache..
<drfsupercenter> 03bbl dinner
<drfsupercenter> 03and what, apache ftw
<TimeShift> just tested with IE - which had zero contact with TST until now. I could login properly over the main page and switch to the forum
<TimeShift> the Logout button of the forum seems to be broken right now - one thing to be fixed on medium priority
<TimeShift> the Logout-Button on the main page works
<Arcanine> 04Spell Effect
<Arcanine> 04Toggle: Nearby enemies are drained by 2.3/2.6/2.9/3.2/3.5 (+0.005 per ability power)% of their maximum health each second.
<Arcanine> 04lol
<Articuno> 12It works for me
<TimeShift> Logging in via the Main Page also logs me in on the Forum
<Articuno> 12*sigh*
<TimeShift> vice versa, too
<Articuno> 12Did the host actually announce this litespeed then?
<Articuno> 12did you find anything?
<TimeShift> nope, nothing
<Arcanine> 04i like this guys logic
<Arcanine> 04step 1 - turn on, step 2 - stand next to enemy, step 3 - watch as they fall over and die
<Articuno> 12No me neither 
<TimeShift> another reason why we should think about moving to an own server. Especially because of all the size TST is taking over the time
<Articuno> 12phone
<TimeShift> on our server WE have control over what's installed
<Articuno> 12Yes
<Arcanine> 04Spell Effect
<Arcanine> 04Amumu entangles surrounding enemy units, causing them to be unable to move or attack for 2.5 seconds, dealing 50 / 100 / 150 (+0.35 per ability power) magic damage to them each second.
<Articuno> 12I'm seriously angry at this but anyway..
<Articuno> 12*sigh* I have to go round and edit every single theme index file now to get the forum link to work on the top menu
<Articuno> 12I can't do that now because it's too late and I'm tired and need sleep
<junh1024-XDCC> sou lots of stuff is hjardcoded html?
<Articuno> 12TimeShift, can you do me a small favour and just do some research on Litespeed for me please? I will do some tomorrow as well,but I'd like to know what's so good about it and why suddenly apache is not good enough :/
<Articuno> 12Not loads of stuff but a few tings
<Articuno> 12:>
<TimeShift> I did already
<Articuno> 12Problem is there's a million site themes to edit lol
<junh1024-XDCC> lihttpd/nginx?
<Articuno> 12What about it?
<Articuno> 12@ junh1024-XDCC
<Articuno> 12Oh sorry you're asking which one?
<TimeShift> the main thing about lightspeed is: it compresses and prefetches different, throttling most clear-text-pages
<junh1024-XDCC> oh
<Articuno> 12I actually think my host are using the paid for version which is litespeed
<Articuno> 12Well anyway..
<Articuno> 12I'm a bit worried now, if Litespeed is the future of the web, I don't know if TST can keep up with that :/
<Articuno> 12*sigh* I'm logged out of the site again for some reason
<Kiara> ugh, i bored :( i going to go do something
<Kiara> ttyl peeps
<Airwolve> it's scared of you
<TimeShift> doesn't look like the future for me. In fact, Lightspeedtech is amlost entirely unknown in the EMEA region
<Articuno> 12Ok
<TimeShift> the "most recent" version of Lightspeed is from January 2009!
<carrington> Hey spyrorocks come check out my fan club ur invited
<Afkaaz> <Arcanine> step 1 - turn on, step 2 - stand next to enemy, step 3 - watch as they fall over and die <- 4 - ??? 5 - PROFIT!
<TimeShift> the host just bought some pre-configured tins with this up because they wanted to boost performance in exchange for features...
<Articuno> 12Yeh lousy host. I can't believe they just DID it one day
<Articuno> 12Anyway
<Articuno> 12Im off to bed
<Quilava> you actually profit from the killing them. lol
<Articuno> 12thanks for your help TimeShift ^v^
*Articuno hugs
<Articuno> 12Couldn't have done it without you
*TimeShift cuddles back
<Articuno> 12I'll try and sort everything out tomorrow
<TimeShift> I told you - TST is an important piece for me
<TimeShift> so are you
<Articuno> 12^v^
<Articuno> 12Well night and speak to you soon
<TimeShift> I hope so, yeah
<Articuno> 12you will
<Articuno> 12night all!
<TimeShift> good for now the page's fixed mostly
<Brother|Oblivion> Wb Aero
<Steve> 12 Hello, Aicebo and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<TimeShift> I think when I take vacation I'll try and rework the ENTIRE page so it's more easily to administer. Currently it's more like a giant mess of patches glueing on each other without giving sufficient support
<Creideiki> Alright... after that minor delay, hello people.
<Arcanine> 04Quilava mercury treads might be my favorite item XD
<Quilava> I actually tend not to use them. lol
<Arcanine> 04what the heck is up with this guy's reccommended item build

<TimeShift> hi and urgh - either I go to bed now and end this day full of stress and work OR I open my first bottle Afri Cola and ignore my body being tired and forcing me into bed
<Arcanine> 04come near me you super die
<Creideiki> The answer to that question depends on what you wish to do.
<TimeShift> that's the problem
<TimeShift> my brain says "go to bed you fool! I need to rest!" but my heart says "stay here and continue working!"
<Creideiki> Also, 04<insert expletive here> you Honduras! :|
<TimeShift> with the brain insisting "I can't work without sufficient sleep!"
<TimeShift> and the heart countering "and I can't sleep with still so much work to do!"
<Nyte> hi hi Night
<NightHawk> heya Nyte
<Creideiki> Compromise... do your work in the half-sleep mode. :P
<Cute_Riolu> I love Merc Boots. <3

<Arcanine> 04+ despair
<Creideiki> (Unfortunately... your work may end up equivalent to work that was "penned in a drunken stupor." :P )
<Arcanine> 04Cute_Riolu, where is Abyssal scepter?
<Arcanine> 04nevermind found it
<Arcanine> 04when using a character
<Arcanine> 04i like having a notepad open for notes like item build and blahblah

<Cute_Riolu> Crowd Control
<Arcanine> 04ahh
<Arcanine> 04thanks
<TimeShift> one last thing before I finally disappear: Never ask the bot what rtfm might mean

<Drake> 04Skylands!
*Drake hugs
*Skylands hugs back
<Creideiki> The time for me is (read the following like a speaking clock): "The current time is nineteen hours, twenty-two minutes, Eastern Standard Time."
<Brother|Oblivion> Lyon: wouldnt it still be monring for him? XD

<Arcanine> 04my amumu training isn't going well XD
<Arcanine> 04the first match i get into the team-mate was all "NOOOOO AMUMU!"
<Arcanine> 04decided that wasn't a good time for me to start my first match with him so i quit out, had to wait a couple minutes to start another match, this time the screen glitched up so i had to quit out again and this time i had to wait 9 minutes
<Nightshadow|VNC> 4W5ell 4D5one7!!! 5You just tried to cheat by typing loads, it LOST you double what you hoped to make.
<Skylands> 10^ lolwhut

<Skylands> 10the*
<Skylands> 10Quite stupid, but meh, it's Nightshadow's bot/bouncer
<Sneas> 03It's a script that gives "money" based on how much you talk XD

<Twilight> 14*Flip
<Twilight> 14LOL
<Theguesst> I know, right
<Theguesst> Why did they have to take out the slots for this?
<Twilight> 14And you can't even buy coins anymore.
<Theguesst> Did parents complain about the game teaching kids how to gamble or something?
<Arcanine> 04the worst part is that the community with this game is fantastic
<Twilight> 14LOL
<Arcanine> 04i've seen very little jerks
<Theguesst> Because that would be bull if they did
<Twilight> 14Well, I admit, the slots WERE addicting
<Twilight> 14But I know better than to do it IRL
<Theguesst> I played Mario 2 and pokemon sapphire when I was 8, and did I gamble at all irl? No.
<Glacymr> 12hmm
<Twilight> 14I mean, I don't even think there are any casinos around her
<Twilight> 14e
<Quilava> maybe you should play something more fun.

<Arcanine> 04no i'm not connecting doing good with winning

<Quilava> its as many blocks tall as it would normally be, and one block wide. the new pieces are a 4 block line, a 3 block line, and a 2 block line

<Quilava> because you aren't desperate for hard disc space
<Quilava> but you can solve that by downloading all the porn you can onto your coputer

<Arcanine> 04heh
<Arcanine> 04the thing is that i downloaded this game

<Arcanine> 04only problem is now i'm miserable lol
<AeroDracohem> Heya pplz~
<Quilava> you tried :| if its making you miserable you should stop
<Arcanine> 04then i'd feel guilty

*AeroDracohem asplodes
<AeroDracohem> bah, Korean boygroups are still weird to me
<Arcanine> 04it's not that i get paired up with bad players
<Quilava> you need to level up more
<Arcanine> 04but the fact that i keep getting paired up against pros
<Arcanine> 04i'm level 14

*Lyon shot
<Glacymr> 12happy birthday aero
<Glacymr> 12:D
<Arcanine> 04i don't know what to do with rammus anymore
<Glacymr> 12nah just kidding happy birthday Lyon
<Brother> happy b-day lyon :O
<Brother> Aero: Korean wut
<Brother> Sadly the Cake is a lie
<Lyon> 04lolwut
<Brother> So we made you emperor instead :D
<Lyon> 04Brother, it's not my b'day
<Arcanine> 04i think i have an almost perfect item build for him
<Arcanine> 04but i can't do anything unless i'm near a tower
*Lyon slaps Glacymr with a giant piece of armour
<Quilava> yeahhh.
<Brother> Steel or Daedric? :P
<Lyon> 04neither
<Arcanine> 04for rammus i think i have it near perfect
<Arcanine> 04apparently someone doesn't understand taunt
<Quilava> sweet.
<Arcanine> 04well we could of killed someone but my friend runs while he's taunted
<Arcanine> 04summoner skills i need to put reconsideration into
<Arcanine> 04i think he NEEDS teleport
<Arcanine> 04i can't do anything with rammus
<Arcanine> 04i've gone the first 20 minutes of this match 0/1/0
<Quilava> sounds AWESOME.
<Arcanine> 04how dull
<Quilava> there needs to be a game where all champions get 0/0/0
<Arcanine> 04now that is being an ass XD
<Arcanine> 04i call a surrender
<Arcanine> 04i get 4 against
<Arcanine> 04someone else calls a surrender they all approve
<Quilava> you've already got a reputation
<Arcanine> 04i should be gaining respect
<Arcanine> 04i'm always able to look at the game 5 minutes later
<Arcanine> 04and say who is going to win
<Quilava> you mean surrender the moment its possible
<Arcanine> 04i've been 100% accurate so far
<Arcanine> 04i never made a wrong prediction lol
<Arcanine> 04i'll have to get more Riot points to buy more tanks
<Quilava> I thought you said you were going to get yourself banned >.>
<Arcanine> 04i am but why not spend more money on it
<Quilava> ..because if you get banned you lose your money
<Arcanine> 04true
<Arcanine> 04still
<Arcanine> 04i'm so conflicted
<Quilava> how about earn IP and spend that instead >.>
<Arcanine> 04i just want people to know for once that i'm more than just a failing idiot
<Quilava> a failing idiot with money?
<Arcanine> 04can you just forget about the banning and money for one second?
<Quilava> sure
<Arcanine> 04i don't really want to get banned
<Arcanine> 04but with how my attitude is right now and how much i'm restraining
<Arcanine> 04i don't know if i really have a choice in the matter
<Arcanine> 04i just feel like i'm a bomb that's going to explode and the only way to vent it out is to complain my head off
<Quilava> you could just stop playing and do something else
<Arcanine> 04i need to practice
<Arcanine> 04..
<Arcanine> 04or i won't get better
<Arcanine> 04hmm
<Arcanine> 04i wonder if i can take poppy
<Arcanine> 04and build a tank out of her
<Quilava> everyone does that already
<Arcanine> 04it's funny because the game itself
<Arcanine> 04doesn't really list her as a tank
<Arcanine> 04but she has incredibly high health
<Quilava> and a <censored> jump-to-the-enemy=and=stun-them attack
<Arcanine> 04lol
<Arcanine> 04i like her ulti
<Quilava> which does?
<Arcanine> 04basically she chooses a target
<Arcanine> 04while her ulti is in effect no one else can harm her except her target
<Quilava> lolcheap
<Quilava> explains a lot though
<Arcanine> 04it does?
<Quilava> when I shoot and they don't take damage
<Arcanine> 04lol
<Arcanine> 04i have to agree with you though
<Arcanine> 04dr. mundo is mean
<Quilava> yeah.
<Arcanine> 04dunno if he's what i'm looking for
<Arcanine> 04i'm looking for someone who is hard to kill
<Quilava> his ult is crazy like that.
<Quilava> his health regen goes up to like 50~100
<Quilava> so he drops HP a bit, lures an enemy, by the time they can get get him low he's regenerating, they die, he goes up to full HP
<Arcanine> 04sigh
<Arcanine> 04think think think
<Arcanine> 04lol did i mention last match
<Arcanine> 04one of the enemies scored a triple kill
<Arcanine> 04that was the only reason i died >_>
<Quilava> sounds fun.
<Quilava> I've only gotten 1 triple kill ever I think..
<Arcanine> 04i've never done it
<Quilava> actually.. I might have gotten two. not sure
<Arcanine> 04i'm still sad no one has thought of a Nasus lucario custom skin XD
<Quilava> but one was as master yi, so that doen't go on my main character's stat card >.>
<Arcanine> 04lol
<Arcanine> 04master yi is nasty >_>
<Arcanine> 04i've seen him work away at towers
<Arcanine> 04just not fair
<Quilava> heh. back when I used to use him, I took out both nexus turrets with one ult (thats less than 12s by the way) without minions or friendly champs with me
<Arcanine> 04there is so many unfair aspects about this game XD
<Quilava> but that makes it balanced!
<Quilava> what I really hate
<Quilava> is when someone uses a knockback skill JUST as I rocket jump. so I actually go BACKWARDS
<Arcanine> 04i was afraid you'd say that Quilava
<Arcanine> 04XD
<Arcanine> 04it's not the first time someone has told me that
<Aero|AFK> gtg Going to my cousin's house
<Arcanine> 04i need to find someone else i'm good with x-x
<Quilava> I can't tell if its ordering errors or what, but it really pisses me off ><
<Quilava> especially when I could have easily escaped
<Arcanine> 04lol
<Arcanine> 04i've played Tris once
<Arcanine> 04messes can occur
<Quilava> yeah.
<Quilava> I like that I can knockback people through walls.
<Quilava> or jump over them
<Arcanine> 04Quilava
<Arcanine> 04i've been meaning to ask
<Arcanine> 04what does killing the dragon do?
<Quilava> .....no clue
<Quilava> look it up on the wiki?
<Arcanine> 04didn't really give io
<Arcanine> 04*info
<Arcanine> 04of course that can always change
<Arcanine> 04it gives global 200 experience and 130 gold to the killing team, as well as 25 gold and additional experience to the killer.
<Arcanine> 04hmm
<Quilava> decent
<Quilava> more gold than a turret.. and easier too
<Arcanine> 04finally logic i love
<Arcanine> 04your character is weak to stun
<Arcanine> 04so equip clense
<Quilava> lul
<Arcanine> 04so...
<Arcanine> 04let's see if i can lose 10 games in a roll now >_>
<Quilava> lol suicide
<Arcanine> 04yep, from the looks of the matchup
<Arcanine> 04i say we lost
<Quilava> lol.
<Quilava> matchup means nothing
<Arcanine> 04it can go either way
<Arcanine> 04but they play more annoying champions
<Arcanine> 04you are right though
<Arcanine> 04what does mean something though is setup
<Arcanine> 04a comanding setup means big troubl
<Arcanine> 04e
<Quilava> keep an eye out for which guys suck. and kill them
<Arcanine> 04you don't have to
<Arcanine> 04they come to you
<Quilava> still. if you switch lanes near the begining and they're somewhere else, hunt them down
<Arcanine> 04olaf omg i hate his axe XD
<Quilava> thats how I got my best game >.>
<Quilava> and yeah. me too
<Quilava> dr mundo has a similar attack, but without the splash damage
*Quilava yawns..
*Quilava colapses and goes to sleep
<Armageddon> 02RETARDED PIANO LESSONS ARE RETARDED
<Soyuz> eh?
*Armageddon is back.
<Armageddon> 02also I hate being PMed constantly
<Armageddon> because then mIRC stuffs up when I have too many windows open and it's <censored> annoying
<Soyuz> Now I'm suddenly glad I done take any musical lessons

<Armageddon> 02And I was like "At least an hour"
<Armageddon> 02And he was like "Only? My son, who is in the Conservatorium of Music, played for 4 hours every day after school"
<Drake> 04._.
<Armageddon> And I was like "Woah, I don't even play for 3 hours during the holidays" while thinking "holy <censored>"

<Icydragon> 12No.
<carrington> i have a thred on genrel chat about that subject if u wanna come and talk about a new game if made
<Icydragon> 12Hello Justin_Long_Fanatic.
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> rly? cool
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL sex references in Toy Story
<drfsupercenter> 03this is precisely why these movies are good
<Aurora> 6LOLWUT
<Brother|Pride> Which reference? XD
<drfsupercenter> 03they're not just "BLAHBLAH THINGS ONLY 3 YEAR OLDS WOULD GET"
<drfsupercenter> 03with Bo Peep thanking Woody for saving her sheep
<drfsupercenter> 03"What do you say I get someone ELSE to watch the sheep tonight?"
<Brother|Pride> XDD
<Aurora> 6oh loool
<Aurora> 6I think I remember a blunt statement like that in the 3rd one
<Brother|Pride> That reminds me of the animaniac references
<Aurora> 6can't remember which
<carrington> yup
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03"Nice ascot"?
*drfsupercenter hides
<Brother|Pride> so subtle but we remember them in our childhood
<Arcanine> 04hi Quilava
<Quilava> hi
<Arcanine> 04:)
<Arcanine> 04how goes
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> shame they didn't have a spyro movie
<Quilava> gine
<Quilava> *fine
<carrington> they did they just cancelld it...
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> that's what i mean, shame
<Arcanine> 04great
<Arcanine> 04i had a couple interested matches after you slept
<Arcanine> 04i tried getting used to Nasus
<carrington> i wanna give those peeps a piece of my mind!
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> lol
<Arcanine> 04i can't get his Q to be super charged though
<Arcanine> 04the highest i ever got was like +80 something
<Quilava> that takes a lot of time.
<Quilava> and 80 is pretty decent
<Quilava> 200 on a regular hit
<drfsupercenter> 03you know
<drfsupercenter> 03there are so many toys in this first movie, that aren't in TS3
<drfsupercenter> 03like the little microphone thing
<drfsupercenter> 03and the snake
<drfsupercenter> 03etc
<Brother|Pride> Or the Fire truck
<drfsupercenter> 03XD the toy soldiers using the baby monitor
<drfsupercenter> 03that too
<Arcanine> 04yeah
<carrington> ive been waiting 4 that movie to come out sinse 2008 when i herd about it
<Arcanine> 04i learned the trick
<Brother|Pride> I rememebr those :O
<Quilava> my win rate is almost up to 50% yay
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> same
<Brother|Pride> I still have those too XD
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> :( stinks
<Arcanine> 04since ranking up Q makes it cost more mana
<Arcanine> 04the trick is to not rank it up until late game
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> wouldn't a new beginning be more fun if they got rid of the annoying levels?
<Arcanine> 04i usually get spirit fire first, then that ability, then i rank spirit fire upto 4 then get wither to 5
<Quilava> the first blood record doesn't work D:
<carrington> hey if they make a new game there should be a 3 player co-op w/ sparx ,spyro, and cynder
<Brother|Pride> Isnt it hilarious how in Toy Story 3 it got so dark?
<Arcanine> 04first blood record?
<Quilava> on your personal page
<Quilava> click on the champion you've used most on the right
<Quilava> and it'll say 'total first blood = 0' even if you've gotten some
<Arcanine> 04what does Penta kill mean
<Icydragon> 12You really can't do much with Sparx...
<Quilava> 5 kills in a short time
<Quilava> aka, kill the entire team
<Icydragon> 12But, whatever....
<Arcanine> 04so an ace?
<Quilava> no
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> true
<Quilava> ace is a kill without taking damage
<Arcanine> 04btw
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Arcanine> 04my prediction was almost wrong last night XD
<Quilava> you know how a double kill works right?
<Arcanine> 04i had a feeling were going to lose this match but everyone is like
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> if i had made new beginning i would of gotten rid of dantes freezer
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> and tall plains
<Brother|Pride> its like "You got a friend in me-BURN BURN IN FIRE MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAH"
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> and put in two cooler places
<Arcanine> 04"we've come back from worse" not beliving them i continued to do my best only to prove them wrong
<Arcanine> 04the game came down to who can kill the nexus first, we were both damaging eachother's nexus's XD
<Brother|Pride> What is it with kid movies and being Dark XD
<drfsupercenter> 03aww, poor Woody, just got knocked off the bed
<Arcanine> 04they won by a mere split second
<Brother|Pride> Lion King, his father dies when he's a kid
<Quilava> lol
<Brother|Pride> Bambi his mother gets kid and no one to even guide him XD
<Arcanine> 04i really got a kick out of that
<Brother|Pride> That elphant is lost from his mother
<Arcanine> 04i thought we actually won the game so i'm like "NOOOOOO"
<Arcanine> 04then the screen starts scrolling over to our nexus so i'm thinking "what?"
<Quilava> NEEDS MORE ATTACK SPEED
<Arcanine> 04actually
<Arcanine> 04we would of won
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i'd put in a electric world and a castle world
<Arcanine> 04but i didn't notice they were at our nexus so i took my time to finish an inhibator
<Quilava> they would have won if you weren't their teammate is my guess
<Arcanine> 04i was the one who were there
<Arcanine> 04*who was
<Arcanine> 04along with a teemo
<Arcanine> 04everyone else was dead lol
<Brother|Pride> darn...still only 62
<Curly> out of greeting ideas so hi
<Proto> Hi
<Arcanine> 04still though, i didn't think it was even remotely possible to get a game to be that close
<Curly> ^^
<Quilava> its very possible.
<Quilava> happens quite often supprisingly
<Icydragon> 12Or a longer flying level...
<Arcanine> 04i did my best, like i promised
<Arcanine> 04actually it was my mistake we lost that one
<Arcanine> 04if we attacked the nexus earlier we would of easily won
<drfsupercenter> 03XD more grownup humor
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> that too
<drfsupercenter> 03"The word I'm looking for, I can't say, because there's preschool toys present"
<Brother|Pride> XD
<Arcanine> 04btw yeah i see what you mean, i've gotten first blood before
<carrington> ok... but say in a new game w/ sparx u have to light toches to move on and u have a power to kill enimies( would be electricity or light)
<Arcanine> 04yet i don't see it counting
<Quilava> I've gotten like.. 3 total
<StarlitDusk> 12If anyone knows where to get a god shoutbox html let be know
<StarlitDusk> 12good
<Arcanine> 04i got 1
<Quilava> could do with a bug report there, as minor as it is
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> hmm
<carrington> u could fly to
<Arcanine> 04was the first blood stat always there?
<carrington> w/ sparx
<Quilava> probably
<Arcanine> 04or was that brand new with the update
<Quilava> no I've seen it before
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL god
<Arcanine> 04ok
<Arcanine> 04that rules out my theory then
<drfsupercenter> 03and here comes my favorite scene in the movie
<StarlitDusk> 12oops
<drfsupercenter> 03o/` Straaaange things, are happening to me o/`
<StarlitDusk> 12*godly shoutbox appears*
<Quilava> and I think I might actually be starting to get good
<Arcanine> 04btw dont' tell lightning this but....
<Quilava> I just need to hit level 21 so I can overpower myself
<Arcanine> 04i slayed the dragon D:
<Quilava> who hasn't?
<Brother|Pride> "And you will know my name is the box, when i lay may shut apon thee"
<Arcanine> 04at level 6
<Brother|Pride> *my
<Quilava> sounds overly time consuming
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL, the little pink haired troll is also not in TS3
<Arcanine> 04actually with Nasus's ultimate it's easy
<Aurora> 6little binoculars
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah those too
<carrington> hey im gonna go have lunch talk later justin ill send u a pm on spyro forums.!
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Aurora> 6but didn't the voice actor for his die?
<StarlitDusk> 12what movie are you watching?
<drfsupercenter> 03no
<drfsupercenter> 03Toy Story
<Quilava> oh, I thought you meant with warwick
<StarlitDusk> 123?
<drfsupercenter> 03and Aurora, the VA for Slinky Dog died
<drfsupercenter> 03no, the first one
<drfsupercenter> 03but I do have a bootleg of the 3rd :P
<Brother|Pride> Ah, thats why the Bum review did that XD
<Aurora> 6so the slinky VA in the 3rd was different?
<Brother|Pride> "Hey why is your voice different?"
<StarlitDusk> 12when i first watched that movie, my mom burned a potato and the potato exploded
<drfsupercenter> 03yes
<drfsupercenter> 03but he sounds a lot like the original
<Brother|Pride> "well umn aofgwslfbsofgaofgvdkagbdaghdoiahgdikagdlshndk"
<Brother|Pride> "oh~"
<Aurora> 6yeah he does
<drfsupercenter> 03but you notice how he doesn't have many lines?
<drfsupercenter> 03I think that was intentional LOL
<Aurora> 6yup
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> k
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> ttyl
<Arcanine> 04WW it's possible
<drfsupercenter> 03but yeah, the few lines he had DO sound a lot like the original guy
<drfsupercenter> 03...LOL
<Arcanine> 04i've heard of people doing it
<drfsupercenter> 03"You know Andy will have a special place for you" "Yeah, like the attic"
<Quilava> it sounds too time consuming. other things would be be better
<StarlitDusk> 12:)
<Aurora> 6RC is gone
<Aristeo> Back :D
<Aurora> 6that was one of my fav caracters
<drfsupercenter> 03oddly enough in the third movie they actually WANT to go in the attic :P
<Arcanine> 04i don't think its worth it
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Proto> :D
<StarlitDusk> 12I like Jessie
<drfsupercenter> 03I liked the binoculars
<Arcanine> 04like you said it takes too long
<Aurora> 6same
<Quilava> at higher levels maybe, when you can kill it fast
<drfsupercenter> 03if you weren't a girl I would make a joke
*drfsupercenter runs
<StarlitDusk> 12and the bo peep doll *shot*
<Quilava> the 130g would be really nice
<Arcanine> 04which is a disadvantage in more than one way
<Aurora> 6.......lol
<drfsupercenter> 03Jessie isn't even hot, I mean seriously
*drfsupercenter runs
<Arcanine> 04it means you are likely to fall more behind in laning
<Quilava> thats 675 gold with one kill
<Arcanine> 04and more time means higher chance of an enemy spotting you and taking you out while jungling
<drfsupercenter> 03I love how bad the animation looks in this LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03even the toys look kinda crappy
<Quilava> if its in the begining of the game nobody goes into the jungle
<Arcanine> 04at level 6
<Aurora> 6drf yeah
<Arcanine> 04some people will probably be trying to gank
<Aurora> 6the VA for the binoculars died
<Arcanine> 04not to mention TF willy easily spot you
<Quilava> yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<Aurora> 6same for the penguin
<Arcanine> 04*will
<drfsupercenter> 03the binoculars are Lenny?
<Aurora> 6Joe Ranft
<Aurora> 6yes
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm trying to figure it out as Debian (Linux) names all its releases after Toy STory XD
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<drfsupercenter> 03so who is Squeeze?
<Aurora> 6squeeze wut
<Arcanine> 04that's why when i jungled with WW
<Brother|Pride> the pengiun I think
<drfsupercenter> 03there's a character named Squeeze, apparently
<drfsupercenter> 03ah
<drfsupercenter> 03that makes sense
<Arcanine> 04and played against TF, i told my team-mates i want to know the very second TF hits level 6
<drfsupercenter> 03...
<drfsupercenter> 03woah, Lenny DOES talk
<drfsupercenter> 03he has like ONE line LOL
<Brother|Pride> :O
<StarlitDusk> 12jessie isn't hot, just awesome
<StarlitDusk> 12and i am a girl, so... ew
<Aurora> 6he's lighting it he's lighting it....hit the dirt
<Brother|Pride> XD
<StarlitDusk> 12LOL
<Aurora> 6and I dont know of a squeeze character
<Brother|Pride> "hfosflshgflahfkasvdkab You Damn toy" < that would be his real response
<Aurora> 6I know of Wheezy
<drfsupercenter> 03oh yeah, Wheezy is the pengiun
<drfsupercenter> 03<Aurora> he's lighting it he's lighting it....hit the dirt <- what?
<Aurora> 6that was the penguin
<Aurora> 6^lenny's line
<Aurora> 6one of em
<Quilava> I should probably play another game now
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<drfsupercenter> 03he was like "Right here, Woody'
<Arcanine> 04:)
<drfsupercenter> 03that's the line I heard
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Aurora> 6yup
<Quilava> almost lv 15
<Brother|Pride> when there was a toyocide D:
<Arcanine> 04i think i might learn to chill out
<Arcanine> 04before i play another game
<StarlitDusk> 12wheezy is loosing his squeak
<drfsupercenter> 03so where's the other line?
<drfsupercenter> 03oh

<Arcanine> 04you think?

<Aurora> 6but yeh, that AC scene o-o;
<Sari> Hello ARi
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL "I <3 Explosives"
<Brother|Pride> That was strange

<drfsupercenter> 03just because I typed in caps doesn't mean it's overreacting
<Aurora> 6not you, you feesh
<drfsupercenter> 03k
<Aurora> 6TALK ABOUT OVERREACTIONS >:O
*Aurora 6runs
*Brother|Pride puts Aurora in the room with the exploding floof AC :O
*Brother|Pride dies
<Arcanine> 04lol Quilava
<Arcanine> 04i just learned of /joke and /taunt
<Brother|Pride> he sounds like a 60s hippie
<Brother|Pride> seriously XD
<Aurora> 6I thought that too LOL
<Brother|Pride> its like He finally admitted he's Square :O
*Brother|Pride runs
<Aurora> 6this toaster makes me want to punt kittens
<Brother|Pride> Again? XD
<drfsupercenter> 03you know what I've never been able to figure out
<Aurora> 6yup
<drfsupercenter> 03when Buzz is in Sid's house
<drfsupercenter> 03and he seeds the commercial on TV
<drfsupercenter> 03how come it was dead silent before and after? LOL
<Brother|Pride> seeds?
<Brother|Pride> :p
<Aurora> 6xD
<drfsupercenter> 03XD Al's Toy Barn
<SheenaFox> :O
<drfsupercenter> 03...
<drfsupercenter> 03This song
<drfsupercenter> 03sounds a lot like this song in Phantom of the Opera
<drfsupercenter> 03"I Will Go Sailing No More"
<drfsupercenter> 03the notes are very similar
<Aurora> 6phatommmmm
<SheenaFox> I Will Go Sailing...
<SheenaFox> I'm on a boat
*SheenaFox shot
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Brother|Pride> drf: whenever I see phantom, I want to destroy something XD
<drfsupercenter> 03why
<Brother|Pride> Phantom Menance
<Aristeo> ^^
<drfsupercenter> 03I love that movie
<Aristeo> Sari: How are you today?
<Brother|Pride> Wut
<Aurora> 6Dennis the Menance
<Brother|Pride> sounds too...dr seus
<Brother|Pride> so take your greed eggs and your green ham Sam I am :p
<drfsupercenter> 03so another thing that doesn't make sense
<drfsupercenter> 03if the toys can actually talk so humans can hear them
<drfsupercenter> 03like when he calls Hannah
<Aurora> 6well duh, woody talks to sid later
<drfsupercenter> 03how come they don't just talk around people?
<drfsupercenter> 03like is there some "law"
<Brother|Pride> Or when Sid reliazes his life will be torrmended by toys? XD
<Brother|Pride> Yes
<Aurora> 6breaks the rules of nature
<drfsupercenter> 03that they can't come alive in the presence of h8umans?
<Aurora> 6:P
<drfsupercenter> 03-8
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<drfsupercenter> 03but I mean
<drfsupercenter> 03why wouldn't they be defiant and just do it
<Brother|Pride> But then heres a more interesting fact
<drfsupercenter> 03like even Buzz
<drfsupercenter> 03even when he thinks he's a real space ranger
<Brother|Pride> If toys could talk, why didnt they talk before these new toys :p
<drfsupercenter> 03he drops dead when Andy walks in
<Aurora> 6well, if you're supposedly on an alien planet
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL "Years of Academy trainer, wasted"
<drfsupercenter> 03*training
<Aurora> 6and something 20 times your size walks in
<Aurora> 6you'd drop dead too
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd be like "PLease don't hurt me"
<Glacymr> 12i'd run
<Brother|Pride> actually he'd use someone as a distration to escape
<drfsupercenter> 03or that
<Glacymr> 12apparently toys
<Glacymr> 12are like fainting goats
<Glacymr> 12they see something that scrares them and fall over
<Sari> Ok,y ou
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Aurora> 6LOL FAINTING GOATS
<Aurora> 6Those things are awesome
<Brother|Pride> I misread that was
<Brother|Pride> Fainting Ghosts
<Proto> Hey Sari :)
<Glacymr> 12*scares
<Quilava> lol
<Quilava> sounds obnoxious
<Arcanine> 04i tested it out on nasus
<Arcanine> 04his joke is "who let the dogs out woof woof woof"
*Arcanine coughs
<Quilava> I know lol
<Brother|Pride> I just noticed
<Sari> Hi
<Brother|Pride> Pride's eyes are now purplish
<Quilava> yay lv 15
<Arcanine> 04just like me
<Arcanine> 048D
<Arcanine> 04i can't wait for level 20
<Quilava> I've gotten 2 wins today in less than 25 mins each
<Arcanine> 04i'm just going to go wild on buying tier 3 runes
<Arcanine> 04i wish people would see it my way more
<Quilava> lv 21 is better. you can get a mastery point into the best skills
<Arcanine> 04if a match looks hopeless
<Quilava> if it looks hopeless, win, and rub it in the opponents face
<Arcanine> 04they should just get it over with and start another match that they have better chances of winning, it's not so much as calling it quits as it is saving time
<drfsupercenter> 03OK how do like 9 year old kids order explosive rockets?
<Brother|Pride> its like the phieus and ferb thing
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't watch that show
<Arcanine> 04the time you wasted turning the game around or just losing more
<Quilava> also I'm probably going somewhere soon so I gotta uh. clean myself
<drfsupercenter> 03I have somewhat high standards for the stuff I watch
<Quilava> so afk
<Brother|Pride> "Arent you a little young to handle a intercontiental balistic missile?"
<Arcanine> 04could of been spent on another match you'll win
<Brother|Pride> "Yes, yes I am"
<Arcanine> 04kk
<Brother|Pride> "oh well OK, done start a nuclear war now"
<Brother|Pride> *dont
<Arcanine> 04someone made an interested point
<Arcanine> 04that you don't get as much experience if you surrender
<Arcanine> 04but that can't than 10-15 experience lost
<drfsupercenter> 03still, SId randomly gets that rocket
<drfsupercenter> 03I doubt they had AMazon back in 1995 LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03so where did it come from?
<Glacymr> 12why are you talking so much about toy story
<Glacymr> 12it's a silly kids movie :P
<drfsupercenter> 03because I'mw atchin git
<drfsupercenter> 03*watching it
<Glacymr> 12hmm
<Brother|Pride> and he needs to be serious now thats he's an adult watching a childrens movie :P
<drfsupercenter> 03OK what
<drfsupercenter> 03Buzz ripped the sticker off his arm
<Glacymr> 12you are just like seto kaiba
<drfsupercenter> 03and it comes back later on
<Glacymr> 12you are grown up
<Aurora> 6...it does
<Brother|Pride> only it isnt a children's card game
<Aurora> 6?
<Glacymr> 12but you sit around and waste your time on a children's card game
<drfsupercenter> 03Yes
<Aurora> 6LOL
<Aurora> 6I never paid attention to that
<drfsupercenter> 03You don't notice how in Toy Story 2 he has the sticker?
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah me neither
<drfsupercenter> 03but now taht I'm wathcing it again
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL Binford
<drfsupercenter> 03Home Improvement reference XD
<Quilava> that's a third of losing experience
<Quilava> 45 to 30
<drfsupercenter> 03since Tim Allen was in that show
<drfsupercenter> 03and they advertised Binford tools
<Quilava> also I'm not leaving quite yet.. still gotta wash some clothes >.>
<Brother|Pride> poor fu
<drfsupercenter> 03I love how Woody is strong enough to fend off an average sized dog
<Arcanine> 04oh
<Arcanine> 04even if you lose half experience
<Arcanine> 04i don't think its worth it
<drfsupercenter> 03"We're going to have to break a few rules"... I don't get what makes the toys want to follow those rules
<drfsupercenter> 03about not coming alive around humans LOL
<Twi|Away> 14XD
<Quilava> meh
<Arcanine> 04:)
<Arcanine> 04surrendering a match is a polite thing to do
<Quilava> I thought you just did it to spite them
<Arcanine> 04it saves time so you can start your next match and your opponents don't have to waste their effort finishing the match
<Aurora> 6forgot how epic this movie was
<Aurora> 6free willy
<Aurora> 6music <3
<Brother|Pride> SHINEN
<Arcanine> 04there is more than one reason for it :P
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02o3o
<Brother|Pride> Free Willy
<Brother|Pride> That movie premise was so used it was original but yet its I love it XD
<Aurora> 6That movie was so awesome
<Brother|Pride> I think I still have Free willy 1-3
<Aurora> 6I-
<Aurora> 6yeah
<Aurora> 6I've got all 3
<Brother|Pride> XD
<Brother|Pride> DVDs?
<Brother|Pride> I bet you dont have totoro :P
<Aurora> 6but I bought the 10th anniversary as DVD
<Aurora> 6the last two are vhs
<Aurora> 6brother, I used to have totoro on vhs
<Aurora> 6lost it
<Brother|Pride> I have all VHS
<Aurora> 6....
<Brother|Pride> :O
<Aurora> 6oh crap
<Aurora> 6I was going to say I have it on file on my laptop
<Brother|Pride> XD its hilarious you seem to have mostly all the movies I have
<Aurora> 6which is now unusable LOL
<Brother|Pride> XD
<Aurora> 6brother, I have so many movies lol
<Quilava> meh
<Brother|Pride> "Totoro DENIES YOU"
<Brother|Pride> Same
<Brother|Pride> Mostly Disney >.<
<Brother|Pride> ironic that I hate Disney to my very "soul"
<Aurora> 6once they started dvds, we got dvds, but the earliers are still vhs
<Aurora> 6early disney <3
<Brother|Pride> Wait
<Brother|Pride> I'm thinking of this one Movie..
<Brother|Pride> NEMO
<Brother|Pride> not the fish one
<Brother|Pride> the other Nemo
<Brother|Pride> the..dream wisher thing
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Speaking of early Disney
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I watched Lion King 1&2 the other day
<Brother|Pride> I still have those
<Brother|Pride> But Ling king 1/2 was a dissapointment
<Brother|Pride> never got around to buy it, I dont like most disney sequels
<Brother|Pride> or prequels
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I like how some sequels are prequels
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Like Tarzan 2
<Brother|Pride> Or that Little Mermaid 3 movie
<Brother|Pride> Yes I'm that sad of a disney hater/fan
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I've seen the beginning of it XD
<Arcanine> 04it logical and evil ^^
<Brother|Pride> Why does Fu die so sadly XD
*Shiny-Growlithe shrugs o3o
<Brother|Pride> then Greed gets Wrath's eye XD that was epic
<Twilight> 14http://jiayi.deviantart.com/art/Pigeons-168353941 <--- <33
<drfsupercenter> 03sigh, headache
<Steve> 12 Hello, LaptopAristeo and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<SpooKy> USA GOT PWNED
<Alek> k?
<Alek> and?
<SpooKy> usa sucks
<Espeon> lol wut

<Alek> derp.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02OhEspeon
<Brother|Pride> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzvZz3ff8ks&NR=1
<Brother|Pride> drf: what part are you on now?
<Aurora> 6its
<Aurora> 6a
<Aurora> 6SA
*Aurora 6tackles high-speed
<Shadowabsol> 14It's a Roara!!
<Brother|Pride> its a SA roara :O
<Aurora> 6it sa roara
<SpooKy> Alek yeah
<Aurora> 6:3
<Brother|Pride> A sora? :P
*Brother|Pride dies
<Aurora> 6LOL
<Chimera> Mrr
<Aurora> 6sora was one of my camp nicknames
<Brother|Pride> XD
<Aurora> 6skittles was first though
<Brother|Pride> WUT
<Aurora> 6which was ironic, cuz I hte skittles
<Aurora> 6*hate
<Brother|Pride> why did they call you skittles?
<Shadowabsol> 14I luv Skittles...
<Brother|Pride> Was it become you went over the rainbow?
<Aurora> 6lmo
<Aurora> 6we had a skittle fight first day of camp
<Brother|Pride> and thats how you got your nicname skittles?
<Aurora> 6so many skittles got stuck in my hair and clothes, we kept finding them all through the day
<Brother|Pride> XD
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I read skittles as kittens
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02...
<Brother|Pride> "oh look its the Skittle machine that walks! :O"
<Brother|Pride> I keep watching this scene over and over again for some odd reason..
<Brother|Pride> Maybe its because Father is one of the only villains that actually succedes in his plans
<Brother|Pride> for 10 seconds
<SpooKy> 3 mins!
<Shadowabsol> 14I've always wanted to spell Roara's name like Rawra. <_< Because it has rawr in it...
<SpooKy> then gg usa
<SpooKy> :D
<Brother|Pride> "hey RAWR"
<Shadowabsol> 14I'm just saying. That's how I would make people do it. XD
<SpooKy> 1 min!
*Shadowabsol 14hides.
<Brother|Pride> other then Lelouch or the Emperor
<Alek> lopl
<Alek> onoz?
<SpooKy> 3 more mins!
<SpooKy> :D
<Lunies> Then Father dies. *nod*
<Brother|Pride> Father is first God, then demi-god then dies XD
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Aka: The little friend from the flask
<Brother|Pride> in the anime they alwaycall him "little thing in the flask; homonculus"
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02That's because those are all his names XD
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02His actual name is Homonculus
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02But goes as Father
<Brother|Pride> LOL remember the time he mocks hohenhiem?
<Alek> 3 more minutes to show the world what everyone already knew?
<Alek> k.
<Brother|Pride> "wait..you're not to bright...maybe Hohenhiem?"
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02And Hoenheim calls him "My little friend in the flask"
<Brother|Pride> he is very little
<Brother|Pride> he makes Pride look big
<Brother|Pride> kinda ironic how Pride in 2003 kills Pride in 2009
<SpooKy> USA GOT PWNED!!!!
<Alek> I've really only been paying attention to the WC at all because of /b/ going "ENGLANDFAGS ARE BUTTHURT OLOLOLOLLLOLOLOLLOLOLLOLOLOLOL"
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Pride wasn't Pride though in 2003
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Pride was Wrath
*Michel pokes Quilava
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02And Wrath was Izumi's kid
<Brother|Pride> and sloth was a woman :O
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02While Sloth was Ed and Al's mom I think
<SheenaFox> ah, well
<SheenaFox> we lost
<SheenaFox> o3o
<Brother|Pride> yeah the main thing I never got with the 2003 anime, is the names
<Aurora> 6wut
<Shadowabsol> 14Well I won't be reading FMA anymore... :/
<Brother|Pride> Sloth isnt slothish
<Aurora> 6...
<Aurora> 6LOL
<Brother|Pride> Wrath seems whiny XD
<Aurora> 6Brave little toaster references the pixar "A113" joke
<Quilava> hi Michel
<Aurora> 6well, disney I guess
<Michel> hi quil :)
<Shadowabsol> 14Whut?
<Brother|Pride> Shiny-Growlithe: the person that could never be the villain is dante
<Quilava> whats up?
<Michel> wanna play some ? :)
<Lunies> Dante sucked
<Brother|Pride> YES
<Brother|Pride> she did
<Brother|Pride> she wanted "imortality"
<Quilava> can't right now. need to keep up on laundry and then I have to bathe. we're going somewhere later
<Michel> okis :)
<Brother|Pride> though kinda funny at Ling reference during that civil war
<Lunies> Yessss, haha. Anyway, I'd much rather Father, though he seems kind of DBZ-ish as of late
<Brother|Pride> Shadowabsol: well tbh there's '2' FMAs
<Lunies> She meant the FMA manga has ended
<Brother|Pride> Shame it has XD so many things you could do with it
<Brother|Pride> there's probablly a few more episodes left
<Shadowabsol> 14If you're counting the whole "Brotherhood" series, then I'm not talking about that.
<Lunies> If you keep going with something, it gets gross. *coughBleachcough*
<Brother|Pride> I dont even think Bleach is even worth continuning XD
<Brother|Pride> seriously, nearly..what 200 episodes have gone?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs37/f/2008/242/9/f/StupidFox___2_by_SilentReaper.jpg
<Shadowabsol> 14I've only read up to volume ten in the FMA manga, and Bleach comes on too late at night for me to remember to watch it, so I almost never do. ^^;
<Lunies> I looooved it before, still do, but if they don't end it after they kill Aizen, I'm done
<Brother|Pride> (though that doesnt beat one pieces 400 freaking episodes >>)
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I've read all of the FMA manga
<Brother|Pride> Shadowabsol: watch Brotherhood
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Bleach makes no sense to me, I ask hundreds of questions about the logic behind it
<Brother|Pride> though it takes a few things out of the manga
<Lunies> Still follows it better than the first series
<Brother|Pride> like the mrs bradley talking about romantic things with King Bradley
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02And I think One Piece is one of the longest mangas I've seen yet, but I still keep up to date on it
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Same with Naruto
<Brother|Pride> the 1st series will never come close to Brotherhood
<Brother|Pride> Naruto is almost over hopefully
<Brother|Pride> I use wikipedia to make sure it is XD
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Why hopefully?
<Lunies> Shiny-Growlithe, is One Piece good? I've wanted to start it a loooong time ago, but the sheer size of it intimidates me
<Brother|Pride> Mostly because After Pain's death
<Brother|Pride> It seems boring again
<Brother|Pride> Pain was like the evil person that almost revivaled Father
<Brother|Pride> the only epic parts are when Sauske kills..that person of that secret organization
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Some parts can be a bit tough to get through, but I believe it's a great anime/manga
<Brother|Pride> Lunies: they're up to 437 episodes on Sub
<Brother|Pride> dont know of Dub yet
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02For One Piece?
<Brother|Pride> Yes
<Aurora> 6so
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02There's over 500 chapters in the manga XD
<Brother|Pride> I check funimation to watch FMA Broherhood
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I think it's 539
<Aurora> 6is this articuno or lugia?
<Brother|Pride> XD
<Brother|Pride> well their close
<Lunies> Eh, I'd go with sub. Funimation redubbed it but I'd rather not watch any 4kids dubs
<Articuno> 12Arti
<Articuno> 12:3#
<Brother|Pride> I just hope thye chose the best voice for Pride
<Brother|Pride> Wrath
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Funimation redubbed it and it's much much better than 4kids lol
<Brother|Pride> and Greed
<Aurora> 6it'sablueburd
*Aurora 6nibbles artitail
<Aurora> 6ITS TAIL
<Brother|Pride> its a blue burd at the night, during the nuclear wasteland of DC~
<Lunies> Brother, they've released the dub a while ago, probably not on their site
<Brother|Pride> I know
<Brother|Pride> I've seen the dub
<Brother|Pride> though they're probablly at episode..20
<Brother|Pride> maybe
<Brother|Pride> Selim Bradley comes at episode 32
<Brother|Pride> Pride comes in later
<Brother|Pride> near the late 30s
<Brother|Pride> earlt 40s
<Lunies> Yeah, they aren't far in. I didn't bother watching because Al's voice was disgusting
<Brother|Pride> Eds voice is the same as the old anime
<Lunies> Yes, Vic <3 I love him, ha
<Brother|Pride> thats probablly the only thing I remember XD
<Brother|Pride> I remember the old Mustang
<Brother|Pride> He was cruel XD remember the dog scene? XD
<Aurora> 6this movie traumitized me when I was little
<Aurora> 6I remember this part x-x
<Lunies> Sliiiightly, you're testing my memory on that one :P
<Brother|Pride> "I LOVE DOG! They're the loyal, and if you are jerks to them they dont ask for a raise or demand you stop. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH"
<Lunies> Oooh, I thought you meant the Warehouse 13 thinger
<Brother|Pride> "jeese mustang you sure are manic today"
<Brother|Pride> No not that XD
<Brother|Pride> Aurora: the near death scene?
<Articuno> 12What movie Roara?
<Brother|Pride> little toaster arti
<Brother|Pride> the BRAVE little toaster
<Articuno> 12Wtf
<Aurora> 6brother, the junkyard scene
<Brother|Pride> Yep
<Aurora> 6I've been terrified of magnet lifters ever since
<Brother|Pride> that scene was the moment of "ARG Not this again"
<Brother|Pride> well it beats getting chased by a cow that just gave birth :|
<Aurora> 6how the heck is this movie even called a kids movie LOL
<Brother|Pride> ask Disney and their depressing movies XD
<Aurora> 6it's so stupid to be an adult movie, but it's horribly dark for kids XD
<Brother|Pride> go watch bambi, tell me you dont cry when the mother dies
<Aurora> 6fff I cry at everything
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Maybe a teen movie then?
<Aurora> 6although
<Brother|Pride> OK dont watch Come and See
<Lunies> Old kids movies are so much better. They were dark and had meaning
<Brother|Pride> By all that is emotional
<Aurora> 6bambi had a silent sad scene
<Aurora> 6I actually don't cry when the mother dies
<Lunies> Now a days they're all about silly things
<Aurora> 6because there's no music
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Ff, I almost cried when I saw The Lion King
<Brother|Pride> D:
<Brother|Pride> Monster XD
*Brother|Pride dies
<Brother|Pride> I cried for it was the perfect atomosphere
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Brother Bear too
<Aurora> 6lion king still makes me cry
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02No matter how many times I watch that scene I always tear up
<Brother|Pride> Come and See made me cry for several reasons
<Brother|Pride> 1; showed dozens of people die
<Brother|Pride> 2; its just depressing
<Lunies> Homeward Bound for me :P
<Brother|Pride> 3; its Byelorussia during the Great Patriotic War
<Aurora> 6hmm....while this movie is creepy, they got quite a few good voices for this song
<Brother|Pride> What wont make you cry in that story?
<Aurora> 6HOMEWARD BOUND
<Aurora> 6FFFFFFF I was crying buckets
<Brother|Pride> I have never attempted to watch that movie, EVEr since I got it
<Lunies> EVERY TIME SHADOW RAN DOWN THE HILL IN THE END!
<Brother|Pride> for I knew I'd cry
<Aurora> 6lunies
<Aurora> 6that yes
<Brother|Pride> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFfDhXXoP0k
<Aurora> 6but also when he fell
<Brother|Pride> This scene is the most traumatic for me
<Aurora> 6and when he stopped climbing back up
<Aurora> 6and when sissy went over the falls
<Aurora> 6and when she met back up
<Lunies> That, too!
<Aurora> 6and when they were left at the ranch
<Aurora> 6pretty much all through the movie XD
<Brother|Pride> whats other movies that are depressing at all levels..
<Brother|Pride> anyone watch dumbo/
<Brother|Pride> *?
<Lunies> Of course
<Lunies> I never liked it as much
<Brother|Pride> That one scene with the mom was the only sad moment for me XD
<Aurora> 6I hate dumbo
<Aurora> 6scared me when I was little
<Brother|Pride> oh the backward history scene :D
<Brother|Pride> very emotionally hatred this scene is
<Lunies> Not a children's film but Enough made me cry
<Brother|Pride> which?
<Lunies> Was about this girl who was running from an abusive husband. Anyway, thry put a twist at the end that's rather emotional
<Brother|Pride> ah
<Brother|Pride> So far Come and See is the most depressing movie I've seen
<Brother|Pride> addicting though
<Brother|Pride> Flying of the Cranes semi beats it
<Lunies> Fly Away Home, too
<Brother|Pride> wait..
<Lunies> People say it's stupid, but I loved it
<Brother|Pride> is that the movie with the ducks
<Brother|Pride> and the girl
<Lunies> Yesss
<Brother|Pride> and the flying machine? :O
<Brother|Pride> I've seen it
<Lunies> Based on the true story
<Brother|Pride> i think I have it
<Aurora> 6hmm

<SpooKy> wut u doin
<Twilight> 14Yes.
<Twilight> 14In HGSS
<Glacymr> 12but
<Glacymr> 12blue is such a cooler color
<Twilight> 14That's why they gave it to a girl
*Twilight flees
<Twilight> 14Red is the main male character, Green is the rival, and Blue is the main female character
<Sneas> 03You'll see. :3
<Glacymr> 12i think they renamed
<Glacymr> 12because green wasn't very common in the US
<Glacymr> 12pokemon green version
<Twilight> 14Yeah
<Twilight> 14In Japan, they release Red and Gree
<Twilight> 14n
<Twilight> 14In the US they released Red and Blue
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02But then gave up when Fire Red and Leaf Green came out :P
<Twilight> 14XD
<Arcanine> 04LoL server seems to be busy a lot these days

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02to avoid any racial remarks
<Twilight> 14Hah
*Twilight wants to move to Japan just because America ruins everything

<Skylands> 10My Silver battery died before Blue did
<Sneas> 03All three of G/S/C have died

<Theguesst> If you upgrade from a bottom line iPod touch, you are getting a brutally butchered version of it.
<Drake> 04Hey Nightshadow
<Theguesst> I mean, the app store crashes every other use for gawd sake.
<Theguesst> And no background wallpaper? Why not
<Armageddon> 02heya :3
<Theguesst> And no multitasking? Well that ruins the whole reason to upgrade.

<Armageddon> 02that was record time

<Drake> 04inb4 not trying
<Light_Lati> now I want to listen to Watcha Say o3o
<Armageddon> 02except for your first try I think
<Armageddon> 02nah
<Armageddon> 02you're good xD
<Drake> 04only because you basically built my team
<Armageddon> 02It's just that my team seems to counter most of yours
<Light_Lati> iCurse you, eXAKR!!!
*Light_Lati hides
<Armageddon> 02Oh how true
<Armageddon> 02But Gengar is good
<Armageddon> 02Espeon has better stats though
<Light_Latias> lol
<Light_Latias> 02
<Drake> 04I need to give it Thunderbolt and Focus Blast instead of Ominous Wind and that other move w/e it is
<Drake> 04?
<Light_Latias> stop making excuses ;P
*Light_Latias hides
<Light_Latias> wait
<Light_Latias> who won it?
<Arcanine> 04Armageddon
<Light_Latias> ok
<Arcanine> 04Gengar also have a better movepool
<Drake> 04LL
<Drake> 04I suck
<Drake> 04I know I do
<Light_Latias> ah
<Drake> 04but that fact is idc
<Light_Latias> I see
<Armageddon> 02Yeah
<Armageddon> 02Gengar has a better moveset
<Armageddon> 02lolwut
<Light_Latias> better to try+fail than none at all?
<Armageddon> 02you have OMINOUS WIND in your MOVESET?
<Drake> 04the reason I don't play Pokemon anymore is because it's basically impossible to win with your favourite Pokemon
<Arcanine> 04gengar has good stats
<Arcanine> 04and is unpredictable
<Armageddon> 02Actually it is possible Drake
<Arcanine> 04there is so many different good ways to play him
<Light_Latias> agreed <late>
<Armageddon> 02I guess
<Drake> 04basically
<Arcanine> 04espeon you are stuck to maybe 1 or 2 different good ways
<Armageddon> 02Drake
<Drake> 04like
<Drake> 04infuriatingly hard
<Drake> 04so much so that it isn't fun
<Armageddon> 02Espeon, Lucario, Leafeon, Houndoom are my favourites
<Drake> 04NS
<Armageddon> 02I've pwned entire teams with them
<Drake> 04Dark types are my passion
<Armageddon> 02Dragonite too
<Armageddon> 02Drake
<Armageddon> 02I could probably beat you with a dark team
<Arcanine> 04yet you complain
<Armageddon> 02if I tried hard enough
<Drake> 04you really can't expect me to kill everyone with an all dark-type team
<Arcanine> 04when you lose to a weavile
<Armageddon> 02XD
<Armageddon> 02Point is, Drake, it is possible
<Drake> 04and keep in mind I'm no hardcore gamer
<Armageddon> 02Hang on
<Armageddon> 02I'll go make a dark team now
<Armageddon> 02then I'll battle you with it
<Drake> 04meh
<Armageddon> 02I'm going to stick Umbreon in it just for the sake of it being a dark type
<Armageddon> 02keep in mind that I HATE stalling
<Arcanine> 04Armageddon
<Arcanine> 04most of the dark types are frail
<Arcanine> 04>_>
<Arcanine> 04of course you need a tank for support
<Arcanine> 04probably make him a mean look baton passer
<Armageddon> 02XD
<Arcanine> 04play spiritomb or sableye
<Alek> http://objection.mrdictionary.net/go.php?n=4035380
<Arcanine> 04so you have someone who isn't weak to dark but in fact can not get hit by it at all
*Altair back
<Arcanine> 04and give it attacks that can take out the main fighting type threats

<Light_Lati> wb again lol
<Theguesst> I think I know why I'm depressed now.
<Theguesst> Facebook
*Light_Lati lols
<Light_Lati> that site is evil >:|
<Brother|Pride> you're depressed because of facebook?
<Theguesst> I can't be myself there because all my "friends" would think I'm too nerdy, which I am.
<Theguesst> That's why
<Brother|Pride> and yourself would be..?
<Theguesst> And it makes me realize how boring my life is without mentioning anuthing related to technology
<Brother|Pride> ah so you're like drf
<Theguesst> Yep
<Theguesst> But there, I can't be
<Brother|Pride> Why?
<Theguesst> I have to be like everyone else is
<Theguesst> So I don't hurt my image
<Brother|Pride> being a mindless robot to society is a bore
<Brother|Pride> but I understand the 'image' concept though I dont go by it
<Theguesst> Well I'm 15 in a school filled with mindless jocks and very few who are like me.
<Brother|Pride> I'm 15 too you know >>
<Theguesst> The ones who are don't have a facebook profile
<Theguesst> So I don't even know why I'm even on facebook anymore
<Theguesst> It's useless
<Theguesst> And that's why
<Brother|Pride> Erm, how does facebook be = to you having to fake yourself out at school?
<Theguesst> I don't know
<Brother|Pride> then they're not connected
<Theguesst> But if my real friends aren't there, then why am I?
<Theguesst> What's the point
<Brother|Pride> Because you either chose to be or were forced to
<Brother|Pride> the point is something entirely different
<Theguesst> Well, both really.
<Brother|Pride> How were you forced to join a site?
<Light_Lati> let me guess for him:
<Light_Lati> peer pressure?
<Theguesst> I chose to after one of my teachers made me join because she thought it would be good for my own social life
<Light_Lati> o.o;
<Light_Lati> wow....THAT is unusual...
<Theguesst> I know
<Brother|Pride> Then it isnt forced
<Brother|Pride> your teacher gave you a suggestive
<Brother|Pride> *suggestion
<Brother|Pride> ARG
<Theguesst> I dont think I need a facebook to be social, though. I have this place and about 10 other forums and 20 other websites to be who I am
<Brother|Pride> Then close your facebook?
<Theguesst> Well, I might keep it to keep in touch with an old friend or two when needed, but I will leave it for awhile and check it about every two weeks or so.
<Theguesst> Maybe less

<Lyon> 04I wanna play it
<Lyon> 04but I don't have a 360
<Lyon> 04that's why i asked
<Brother|Dante> I've only heard that old, poem
<Glacymr> 12hmm
<Lyon> 04well, there is a game about it
<Glacymr> 12Dante's Inferno?
<Brother|Dante> Yes, I know

<Glacymr> 12and run away
<Sparky> 2o-o
<Brother|Dante> kinda interesting they never do talk about Dante's poem in church
<Lyon> 04probably because their view of 'hell' is different
<Brother|Dante> I thought it was always based on a 9 circle ever since then?
<Curly> oh, I'm here now. didn't see the news but I heard a bit about it. didn't realize it was that bad though o.o
<Sparky> 2not always
<Brother|Dante> what other ways did they think up hell?
<Sparky> 2it's becoming more popular to say that "hell" is eternal separation from God
<Brother|Dante> other then a firey pool of suffering
<Sparky> 2o3o well it was originally just a giant black pit of isolation
<Brother|Dante> yes, yes to place lucifier in for he had the sin of pride and wanted more
<Sparky> 2no, just of isolation
<Armageddon> 02heya Darkhunter
<Armageddon> 02:3
<Brother|Dante> Seems dull
<Sparky> 2separated from everything
<Sparky> 2exactly
<Glacymr> 12hmm
<Lyon> 04I heard that the church's idea of 'hell' was an individuals worst fears being realised
<Sparky> 2o3o that is another belief
<Sparky> 2...
<Lyon> 04and I thought Lucifer was imprisoned for Treachery, not Pride
<Sparky> 2you DO realize how large Christianity is, right?
<Lyon> 04yes
<Lyon> 04wai
<Lyon> 04no
<Sparky> 2there's tons of different sects, and a lot of them have their own distinct belief on the subject
<Lyon> 04I don't
<Aicebo> YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN MEAN THE PAST FEW DAYS IT BREAKS LITTLE AICEBOS HEART BAWWWWWWWW
<Brother|Dante> large, but sure isnt unified
<Sparky> 2o3o that's because it's really debatable what the Bible is actually trying to say
<Brother|Dante> depends
<Brother|Dante> do you mean the old or the new testement?
<Sparky> 2both
<Sparky> 2if I only meant the old testament, I'd say the Old Testament
<Darkhunter101> :L
<Darkhunter101> Hi
*Brother|Dante shrugs
<Sparky> 2the New Testament is an entirely different situation because of Jesus's sacrifice, so there's no longer a need for "oh you sinned *zap*"
<Sparky> 2so both
<Lyon> 04and lol
<Lyon> 04I saw a poster

<Drake> 04I wonder how many times it's gone through YOUR head
<Brother> I see
<Lyon> 04also
<Lyon> 04the main quest is LONG
<Lyon> 04and HARD
<Brother> Yeah..Oblivion's isnt..o3o;
<Lyon> 04but the final battle is more epic
<Brother> It's more tedious like
<Lyon> 04in Morrowind it's...a letdown
<Lyon> 04it's difficult, I'll say that
<Lyon> 04but it lacks epicness, mainly because of the music
<Brother> yeah, but then after oblivion it gets rather boring
<Airwolve> just not enough sfx?
<Lyon> 04and the fact that HE LOOKS UGLY
<Lyon> 04yeah
<Brother> but it has good weather,etc
<Brother> He?
<Lyon> 04there is like, 3-4 battle music clips in the whole game
<Lyon> 04and they are used in all enemy encounters
<Lyon> 04yeah
<Lyon> 04the main villian
<Airwolve> get all the mods to enhance Morrowind and it can look pretty damn impressive
<Lyon> 04I won't say anymore because of spoilers
<Lyon> 04Brother
<Lyon> 04I only have it on Xbox
<Airwolve> not sure if anyone's overhauled the final battle though
<Lyon> 04wait
<Lyon> 04I mean Airwolve

<Arti|mobile> I keep being told it is by Americans a.d they blank it out on American kid shows
<junh1024-XDCC> since she's a Pycho-logist
*junh1024-XDCC runs
<Brother> Arti: A.D.?
<Armageddon> 02thanks
<Armageddon> 02XD
<Brother> but then thats 'kid' shows
<Alek> and, probably
<Brother> but then kid shows various
<Glacymr> 12it's a mild swear
<Brother> from mindless/stupid propaganda that has no worth or mean to exist
<Brother> and then actual shows that use it subtly
<Arti|mobile> lol well I was told off for using it on tst forums and people replace it with stars a lot
*junh1024-XDCC np: BS eien no ongaku - Anime shudaika daizenshuu 2005 -Audio Version-: Yoko Takahashi - Zankoku na Tenshi no Teeze 02:39m mp3@224kbps
<Brother> XD
<Arti|mobile> only Americans though
<Alek> but how does peess mean drunk? Never heard it used like that before :V
<Brother> thats because people seem to be so senstive
<Brother> Alek: in the old days of englad
<Brother> (AKA 1940)
<Brother> it used to mean such
<Alek> lolpoliticalcorrectness
<Arti|mobile> we use it as drunk all the time here
<Alek> kinda like gay?
<Alek> :V
<Brother> No
<Alek> @brother
<Arti|mobile> its common to say "we're gonna get peesed tonight "
<Brother> that term has a different story
<Brother> though, kinda same thing
*IcyNinetales plans to draw more dragons over vacation in 2 weeks
<Alek> also pees means urine
<Brother> I think 'gay' used to mean burning sticks or some form of that
<Lyon> 04dragons
<Brother> and then somehow got into what it is now
<Brother> lingistics can be complicated
<Alek> dray-gawns
<IcyNinetales> 02O_o
<Brother> Dragooons
<Alek> nice is an example of a word that changed meaning
<Lyon> 04ovo
<Alek> and ironically is used in its original way now :V
<eXAKR> http://vimeo.com/12858526
*IcyNinetales listens to "Ocean Soul" from Nightwish

<Alek> most used examples as an example, that is
<Armageddon> 02XD
<Alek> so basically make own server and idle in own channels
<Alek> :0
<Armageddon> 02nope
<Alek> or get friend to make small server

<Cynder> 04not everyone has one of those scripts you know
<Arcanine> 04!spyro
<Cynder> 04and tbh it's getting very irritating to watch people spam the channel with '!<insertusernamehere>'
<Arcanine> 04have a sense of humor
<Cynder> 04I do
<Cynder> 04but watching people spam is not funny
<Armageddon> 02o.o
<Arcanine> 04spam is subjective
<Cynder> 04soon enough this place will turn up like SW
<Armageddon> 02If it does, I will jump off a cliff into yo dick
<Armageddon> 02:)
<Cynder> 04._.
<Arcanine> 04oh
*Cynder is a girl
<Armageddon> 02I mean
*Cynder SHOT
<Arcanine> 04so spam irritates you
<Arcanine> 04but something like that doesn't
<Drake> 04yes
<Arcanine> 04i see how it is now
<Armageddon> 02How likely is it for us to end up as a couple?
*Arcanine is offended and storms off
<Drake> 04uh
<Armageddon> 02[/torturing Drake is fun]
<Drake> 04dunno
<Armageddon> 02I'm sure we'll be a couple one day, if we don't fall in love with someone else first XD
<Drake> 04considering the chances of actually meeting IRL, plus the chances we'll see each other for an extended period of time...
<Drake> 04not good
<Armageddon> 02I hope you know whether I'm joking or not
<Drake> and what was all that <censored> about "I'M THE ONY ONE FOR YOU" back a few weeks?
<Drake> 04yeah
<Drake> 04I know
<Drake> 04that
<Drake> 04you're joking
<Armageddon> 02It's still true ya no
<Drake> 04oh?
<Armageddon> 02:)
<Armageddon> 02I'm still the only girl good enough for you.
<Drake> 04haha
<Drake> 04'good enough'
<Arcanine> 04gack
<Drake> 04please, if I'm to get ANY girl I need really low standards
<Arcanine> 04romance
*Arcanine adverts eyes
<Drake> 04considering how I seem to repel anyone who comes near me
<Arcanine> 04now that is spam
<Armageddon> 02Haha Glacymr
<Armageddon> 02and Drake
<Armageddon> 02You ATTRACT everyone
<Drake> 04hahaWUT
<Armageddon> 02See it this way
<Armageddon> 02You're the negative charge
<Armageddon> 02boys are positive
<Armageddon> 02I mean
<Armageddon> 02girls are positive
<Drake> 04oh boy science
<Armageddon> 02see
<Armageddon> 02XD
<Armageddon> 02FFF
<Drake> 04loooool
<Armageddon> 02[19:31:42] <Drake> 04oh boy science
<Drake> 04I expected that
<Armageddon> 02that damned pun
<Drake> 04lol
<Armageddon> 02.-.
<Armageddon> 02And in our school magazine quotes last year
<Armageddon> 02this asian teacher was like
<Drake> 04!setgreet [19:31:42] <Drake> oh boy science
<Armageddon> 02"Negative charge is attracted to positive charge like girl attract to boy. But there are some girl who are attract to girl and boy who attract to boy..."
<Armageddon> 02It made me lol
<Alek> 'ror'
<Drake> 04lol
<Armageddon> 02XD
<Drake> 04NS
<Drake> 04girl x boy is so much more complicated than negatives and positives
<Drake> 04that's just one factor
<Drake> 04and besides, we see plenty of people proving that factor wrong today
<Drake> 04I mean, really
<Drake> 04how would you define 'love'?
<Drake> 04(hey look I'm getting phylosophical)
<Alek> some convoluted system I want nothing of
<Armageddon> 02Depends on HOW you want me to define it
<Drake> 04what do you think it is?
<Alek> +=05.34.46=+ <Alek> some convoluted system I want nothing of
<Armageddon> 02Do you mean the 'word' or 'feeling'?
<Drake> 04the feeling
<Armageddon> 02Well
<Armageddon> 02I haven't really 'felt' 'love' before
<Armageddon> 02Okay
<Armageddon> 02I'll put it this way
<Armageddon> 02Everyone's meaning of love is different
<Arcanine> 04love is just spam
*Arcanine uses /clear
<Armageddon> 02I'm guessing it's the euphoric feeling when you suddenly have a desire for someone and some side effects are lightheadedness, constant thinking about them, and generally getting distracted
<Armageddon> 02And no
<Armageddon> 02That wasn't really intended to be funny even though the way I worded it makes it sound like some disease
<Armageddon> 02Which you could put love as
<Armageddon> 02a disease
<Armageddon> 02@ Drake
<Drake> 04hmm
<Armageddon> 02Though really
<Armageddon> 02'Love' is very vague
<Drake> 04Considering that, I personally don't have a definition for it
<Armageddon> 02You can't really define love, Drake
<Drake> 04true
<Armageddon> 02It's a "feeling"
<Armageddon> 02It's not a solid object or thing
<Armageddon> 02It's not something you can "see" with your own eyes
<Drake> 04but then scientists will come up with all these theories of chemicals, hormones etc
<Drake> 04but I see where you're coming from
<Armageddon> 02lol
<Drake> 04I also find it funny that this discussion came up from you torturin- I mean joking around
<Armageddon> 02Love != chemicals/hormones
<Armageddon> 02maybe it's what causes it but it's not really what it is
<Armageddon> 02lol
<Armageddon> 02o-o
<Drake> 04lol
<True_ai> o.o
<True_ai> i don't "love"
<Alek> hey True_ai.
<True_ai> unless love is the feeling i get when i make chaos, that joyful heart warming feeling i get when 300 users d/c from a server do to my spam
<True_ai> if that is love, then i do "love"
<Drake> 04oh the cliche
<Drake> 04Artificial Intelligence + Love = does not compute
*Drake shot

<Presea> i can't believe i lagged you on other servers from my server's spamage
<Armageddon> 02on his server
<Armageddon> 02yeah
<Armageddon> 02It disconnected everyone like
<Armageddon> 02at least 20 times
<Armageddon> 02xD
<Presea> in like
<Armageddon> 02over the length of 15 minutes or less
<Presea> a minute
<Armageddon> 02prolly around 10
<Armageddon> 02XD
<Armageddon> 02or 5
<Armageddon> 02XD
<Armageddon> 02actually, yeah
<Presea> well no
<Presea> from what i saw with repod
<Presea> he connected about 50 times
<Presea> within 3 mins
<Presea> ;p
<Presea> i did set the reconnect throttle higher
<Presea> ah it's fun making services mass join and part 1000s of times while spaming random colors and lengths of text, making 2000 fake users and having them all spam as well
<Presea> quite fun
<Presea> it's also fun seeing mirc.exe using more then 50% of the cpu on a daul core pentium 2.2GHz cpu
<Presea> 8D
<Alek> daul core is pro core
<Presea> also more fun seeing that mirc's scripts are too much for anope services to handle

<Tuffy> 04I'm supporting Germany through the rest of this match
<Tuffy> 04Cos my countries unsporting T_T...

<Tuffy> 04Pfff.
<Tuffy> 04I know.
<Tuffy> 04I know it's you Arti.

<Tuffy> 04RIots in Newcastle, beating people to death
<Tuffy> 04I won't be surprised if some guy takes it out on me by smashing a brick through my window once this is over.
<TimeShift> another thing I like about us: We may have quite many and wild fans, but "hooligans" are a typical english phenomenon
<Tuffy> 04Too right.

<Tuffy> 04Ok, England have been humiliated enough, quit the replay.
<Espeon> ;D
<TimeShift> I like england. Some of the food may be odd, but the countryside is wonderful. Plus I know some good friends on this continent :)
<Lugia> 12timeshift, this is xai, did you see that the germans were around 3m offside when they scored. the officials suck in this match
<Tuffy> 04It's full of anti-social behavior, especially where I am.
<TimeShift> not when the original shot was done. That's the only moment relevant :)
<Tuffy> 04In fact in MY STREET, and I'm not kidding, some jackass was having a cannabis farm...
<God> lol
<TimeShift> if you're standing right, the ball is played and one of the players can run faster than the rival, it's ok
<Tuffy> 04And as for the motto, 'Come On England' Wth? What kind of motto is that?
<Tuffy> 04Thats not motivational.
<Tuffy> 04It's like England fell flat on it's face and are being yelled at by the guy who yells at his cats.
<TimeShift> to be honest, anti-social behavior seems to be "in" in the meanwhile. Plenty of those here, too
<TimeShift> I mean - a man was beaten to death by three kids at a train station in Munich about half a year ago. Know why? Because he protected two girls from being robbed by those guys.
<TimeShift> sidenote: About 50 people stood at the train station and watched the thing happening - without even calling the police
<Tuffy> 04*facepalm*
<Lugia> 12timeshift, when the ball was kicked they were offside
<Tuffy> 04Eitherway, we live in a messed up world.
<Tuffy> 04Where the good never did, and never will win.
<TimeShift> really? Guess I missed that scene here.
<Tuffy> 04Oh surprise surprise
<Tuffy> 04England lost already
<TimeShift> GOOOAAALLLL!!!!
<Lugia> 12F***!!!!!!!!
<Tuffy> 04Don't be so surprised Arti.
<TimeShift> now THAT was NOT offside :P
<Lugia> 12no that was a good goal
<Tuffy> 04Well, I cant watch anymore of this torment.
<Tuffy> 04I'm gonna go on my Xbox
<TimeShift> and to take the ball back up @Tuffy: Because of THAT I'm someone wishing to do my part to make this world a bit better
<Tuffy> 04We all are.
<TimeShift> that's why I volunteered as one of our company's first-aid helpers and donate for local pet protection institutions
<Tuffy> 04Good for you. And I wasn't being sarcastic.

<Lugia> 12cOME ON TimeShift even you saw that right???
<Tuffy> 04Oh, did it not count?
<Lugia> 12:((((((((
<TimeShift> I saw it, yes
<Tuffy> 04HAHAHAHAHA!
<Lugia> 12They just did a replay and it went in, perfectly..
<Tuffy> 04I thought some dumbass would come with an excuse
<Lugia> 12why do we always be cheated out of a win
<Lugia> 12i woulden't mind if we lost fairly
<Tuffy> 04Cos Football
<Tuffy> 04SUCKS
<Tuffy> 04BALLS
<Lugia> 12we're always cheated
<Tuffy> 04That's why
<Tuffy> 04We're full of unsporting jackasses
<TimeShift> maybe it's just a counter for what happened in wembley. Dunno. Was definately in
<Lugia> 12i bet someone has paid the linesman they are crooked as hell
<TimeShift> mabe he was just sleeping or enjoying one of the south african ladies at this moment?
<TimeShift> or he suffered a brain damage due to this constant vuvuzela-crap
<Tuffy> 04Im playing Halo
<Lugia> 12LOL!!!!
<TimeShift> haaah - found the second sound channel on my television transmission: They run a filter over it to get rid of this sh*t
<Tuffy> 04better than that football bulcrap
<TimeShift> definately NOT
<Lugia> 12XD
<TimeShift> honestly: If any south african would be insulted because I say these things are the biggest waste of being EVER invented and should be forbidden globally - so be it
<Lugia> 12XD
<LLOTS|Away> You know, all I can say is GAY
<Articuno> 12this is so out of order - why can't we have a fair match
<Tuffy> 04Never could, never will
<Tuffy> 04Cos Football is scum of the world
<Tuffy> 04The football fans, (most of them) are the offspring of scum
<Articuno> 12Those scum ruin it for all of us Tuffy
<Tuffy> 04Damn right they do
<Tuffy> 04Anyway
<Articuno> 12You shouldnt base your likes and dislikes on other people
<Tuffy> 04I just had fun
<Tuffy> 04Playing something else!
<LLOTS|Away> You really should've seen the major disappointment at my place when England's 2nd goal was disallowed even though it clearly went in >v>
<Articuno> 12i don't know why we even enter the world cup - we are cheated in every single tournament
<Tuffy> 04Football should be forbidden
<Tuffy> 04The cheater should lose their soul
<TimeShift> nah, England wasn't cheated on the last world cup
<Articuno> 12i mean how can they be that blind?
<Articuno> 12they must be bent.
<TimeShift> how can a team be cheated by watching the others play?^^
<Articuno> 12we have been cheated out of many
<Articuno> 12remember argentina?
<TimeShift> maybe you're calmed when you hear all the german fans think it'S 2:2 now and request more effort from the team to prove a victory from being deserved
<Michel> rofl
<Articuno> 12that is good. Germans have good sportsmanship
<LLOTS|Away> ^
<Articuno> 12i would be happy if we were defeated fair and square
<Articuno> 12but if this ends 2-1 or 3-2 we will have been cheated
<Articuno> 12that linesman needs firing
<LLOTS|Away> Over a foot past the line in the replay <<<
<Articuno> 12how can you be at that level of playing and be that inept
<Articuno> 12over a yard actually
<LLOTS|Away> That's what I just heard from the TV so meh XD
<Articuno> 12bbc did a freeze frame and it was a yard
<LLOTS|Away> Either way it shouldn't of been disallowed
<LLOTS|Away> Anyway I'm off to the pub for the second half, laters all
<TimeShift> I hope the result will be fair, too
<Tuffy> 04It wont be
<Tuffy> 04Football is never fair =3
<Tuffy> 04Im having the time of my life playing Halo
<Tuffy> 04Lmao
<TimeShift> what other game is fair, hm?
<Articuno> 12master cheif needs to kick that linesman's ass
<Tuffy> 04Pokemon
<Tuffy> 04Yugioh maybe
<Articuno> 12it is a bit like tennis if it went out by almost a yard then the guy saying it was in
<Articuno> 12or snooker and the ball hitting a red and the ref calling a foul
<Articuno> 12it is so immensely poor it is not believable
<AeroDracohem> Heya pplz~
<TimeShift> a game is a game. As long as humans are involved, errors can happen
<Articuno> 12that magnitude of error is not acceptable
<AeroDracohem> Talking about the football match? Or something entirely different?
<Articuno> 12if 50,000 people, germans english, everyone can see and 1 linesman cannot then he is not suitable to be a linresman
<Articuno> 12in fact i think he saw it fine but is bent. i can't believe that he missed it genuinely
<TimeShift> did you see the second german match in this world cup?
<Articuno> 12no
<TimeShift> I'd like to refer to it as "the card game"
<TimeShift> the referee called for a foul every(!) time another player got close to another
<TimeShift> ~60 fouls in a game or so
<TimeShift> and not a single one was a real foul
<Articuno> 12TRhat was REALLY close..
<Articuno> 12we're really going for it
<eXAKR> Still remember there was a match in the last World Cup in 2006 where yellow and red cards just flew everywhere
<TimeShift> GOAL!
<Articuno> 12noooooooooooooooooooo
<eXAKR> Apparently, the match turned into a mass free-for-all wrestling match
<eXAKR> TimeShift: who?
<TimeShift> Germany
<eXAKR> Vs. ?
<TimeShift> England
<eXAKR> Ah
<Articuno> 12Ok I'm going to admit defeat now..
<Articuno> 12xai's not
<eXAKR> No wonder I can hear the "AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW" from my neighbours XD
<eXAKR> Singapore's nuts
<eXAKR> *Singaporeans
<eXAKR> They love England more than they love our own team
<TimeShift> game's still going for at least 25 minutes
<TimeShift> if we count the overtime
<TimeShift> AFTER that we can admit defeat or victory. But not before this
<eXAKR> I don't really care who wins the World Cup anyway
<eXAKR> As long as it's not someone who is a sore loser
<eXAKR> *was
<eXAKR> Italy flopped big time this year
<eXAKR> Like France in 2002
<TimeShift> another GOAAAALLL!
<eXAKR> Though I could love to see England lose just to see how many broken hearts there will be in Singapore
*eXAKR RUNS
<TimeShift> at least the victory will be clear now
<TimeShift> and the not-counted goal is out of discussion
<SpooKy> who is god lol
<Lugia> 12true, but still, will ruin the mood for the rest of the day this side >> I hope not, but I think it will...

<Presea> fun
<Presea> i got lazy this time, and went with a premade youtube script
<Presea> >.>
<Lugia> 12Heya Andrew ;>
<Presea> though i might tweak this one to select how many results to output
<TimeShift> nowdy Andrew
<TimeShift> and congratulations. England was a very dominant and strong second winner in this match
*eXAKR deflates Bloatedfish
<TimeShift> did you inflate him before?
<Bloatedfish> i'm already deflated u____u
<eXAKR> Deflated him too many times to count
*eXAKR overinflates Bloatedfish
<LLOTS|Away> <@TimeShift> and congratulations. England was a very dominant and strong second winner in this match <<< England was everything but that
<Bloatedfish> lots of nearly-goals
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14England's defense was terrible
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I left the pub after Germand scored the 4th goal
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Germany*
<Andrew> hey Lugia
<Lugia> 12I don't even want to go outside..
<TimeShift> hey, at least you lost against friends
<Lugia> 12Everyone is going to be suicidal D:
<Lugia> 12Yeh
<Lugia> 12and not Americans *runs*
<Andrew> lol
<Andrew> i actually find it funny, since i don't care about football
<Andrew> i was tempted to chant "VIER - EINS" when i was at work
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14The England flag that I had up in teh window is already been taken down lol
<Arti|Asdf> 12You would have had your head cut off..
<Arti|Asdf> 12D:
<Andrew> ya
<TimeShift> I was amazed the americans could play soccer....thought they'd try to grab the ball and throw it over the goals instead :P
<Arti|Asdf> 12All our England flags are going down.....
<Arti|Asdf> 12LOL
<Arti|Asdf> 12IT'S CALLED FOOTBALL TIMESHIFT D:<
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14England were crap throughout the 4 games they played,
<Andrew> england have always been crap, apart from once 44 years ago
<eXAKR> I forsee productivity here in Singapore, which is England-crazy, dropping like a rock tomorrow
<eXAKR> Anyway, bed soon
<Bloatedfish> i wonder how many people worked overtime during the world cup
<Andrew> i worked 10-5 today
<Andrew> was pretty dead all afternoon
<Arti|Asdf> 12*sigh*
<Bloatedfish> well performance usually has something to do with the economy
<Andrew> and half the staff were upstairs in the cantine watching tv
<Arti|Asdf> 12The roads were dead too
<Arti|Asdf> 12Easy drive down
<Andrew> you're in devon now right?
<Bloatedfish> so I reckon if instead of watching the football, people just worked all through the world cup (afaic it's OVER now), we might have performed better
<Arti|Asdf> 12Yeh
<Andrew> :)
<Andrew> is it hot and sunny there too?

<TimeShift> even my home-quad-core takes almost half an hour to unpack it
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I've just realized I haven't worn a short throughout this entire week </random>
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14shirt*
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14It's been that hot XD
<TimeShift> upload of TST to backup site in progress
<Skylands> 10Yeh, I've been wearing a cami all week, it's so humid
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Hot and sticky D:
<Skylands> 10and my parents are the people who are cheapskates, so they keep the thermostat really high to save money >_>
<Skylands> 10Then cold for winter
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14x-x
<Tiel> Hot and sticky here as well
<Tiel> and thunderstormy
<Tiel> We actually had a severe weather warning last Friday
<Tiel> we had to hunker down in the basement until it passed XD
<Skylands> 10Whenever I complain, mum says "When you start paying for it, you can change the tmeperature to what you'd like"
<Tiel> Running the air conditioning is expensive, though |D
<Skylands> 10then I'm like "STFU"
<Skylands> 10I know, but it's like a volcano here x_X
<Tiel> So it sort of makes sense from their point of view
<Tiel> Where do you live? o-o
<Tiel> California was like a volcano when I lived there xD It was insannnneeee
<Skylands> 10I don't give out where I live to most XD Sorry
<Tiel> Oh, that's fine. I was just curious |D
<Skylands> 10Although, I can assure you I don't live anywhere near the equator :P
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I live in England so :P
<Skylands> 10Yes I may be over reacting about it feeling volcano-ish around here, but meh
<Skylands> 10I naturally complain about things I dislike/hate lol
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14lol
<Skylands> 10In moderation, that is

<Lunies> Roara, after the first 3 months, it gets better
<Roara|Lessons> lol
<True_ai> Title: 400 Bad Request
<Lunies> Unless you've got an acoustic, then they'll toughen up faster
<Roara|Lessons> what type were you referring to before?
<Lunies> Well, based on my experience with an electric/light gauge strings, I've played for 3 months and I can still only play for about 2 hours before I need a break'
<Tiel> fail ai
<Roara|Lessons> lol
<Roara|Lessons> all the electric guitars in the house are my dad's
<Roara|Lessons> I've got an acoustic
<Lunies> My dad never played his anymore, so he let me have it so I didn't have to go out and buy one. You're supposed to learn on acoustic, but ah well
<Roara|Lessons> yeah that's why I've got one
<Roara|Lessons> :)
<Lunies> Yeaaaah, dad-moochers, unite!
<Lunies> Oh wait
<Lunies> I just realized what you meant
<Lunies> Nevermind ):
<Roara|Lessons> lol
<Roara|Lessons> we;ve got like...10 guitars in the house
<Roara|Lessons> I'm not entirely sure if he'll actually give me this one
<Lunies> Oh wow... spare one for the poor?
<Roara|Lessons> but he gave it to me to learn on
<Roara|Lessons> this is actually a nice one, his other acoustic is a 12 string
<Sneas> 03False_ai
<Roara|Lessons> as for the 3rd acoustic...I haven't the slightest idea where it is
<Lunies> 12 string, wow
<Roara|Lessons> yeah
<Roara|Lessons> it's pretty intense
<Lunies> Wouldn't it be hard to get your hand around, too?
<Roara|Lessons> I would imagine
<Roara|Lessons> I strummed it once, just to see what it was like
<Roara|Lessons> all 12 strings together sounded awesome xD
<EpicStatsGuy> 14,15 Welcome to the Federation Starship SS Buttcrack.
<Lunies> I'd think so! It'd be so intense to play, so cool *o*

<Tern> derp what did I miss
<Armageddon> ohlol
<Armageddon> Wow. I didn't even talk and you gline me. >.> I was minding my own buisness making my own channel and you gline me. I knew after that 1 kill you didn't want me in any channel, so I made my own. I don't like talking to you on email. And part of the reason I came on #true-flame was to see if you were there.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02http://i35.tinypic.com/v46wdv.jpg :D
<Tern> LOL
<Armageddon> He's an idiot
<Armageddon> and LOL Shiny
<Armageddon> I recognise that url
<Armageddon> it's that no picture
<Armageddon> XD
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Yes, yes it is
*Sneas byebye channel o.o
<Gameboo> Oh, hey NS
<Gameboo> What about a tournament script?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02This is the only reason I don't like giving out my email
<Tern> idk about my email
<Tern> I only use it for newsletters and signing up for stuff, really
<Tern> and occasionally yahoo groups
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I only use it for signing up on stuf
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02stuff*
<Armageddon> Yeah
<Armageddon> We have a tournament script which can be used by moderators, Gameboo
<Armageddon> it starts a tournament on the server
<Gameboo> Ah
<Armageddon> that people can join via /join or !join
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Even in competitions, when NS says "Email such-and-so to Shiny and me" they STILL only send it to NS
<Armageddon> If Glacymr is on he can show you
<Gameboo> I was thinking of some official type of tournament in the forums
<Armageddon> Yeah
<Gameboo> I've seen how it works before
<Armageddon> That too, Gameboo
<Armageddon> I was thinking of that
<Armageddon> But we need moar people first
<Gameboo> Something spread out over a few weeks
<Tern> You should make it so it's disqualified if it's only sent to NS
<Armageddon> and Shiny
<Armageddon> I intend to make the email philosophy@ho-ohrealm.net
<Armageddon> that forwards to both our emails
<Tiel> btw
<Tiel> Can someone send me the text color script?
<Tiel> because I am far too lazy to look it up
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Tiel
<Tiel> and also have no idea where I would look it up XD
<Tiel> Hm?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02You go to the magical fairies and ask them to paint your text for you

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02mmm
<Arcanine> 04wild Armageddon is gone D:
<SheenaFox> I think the phrase "LOUD NOISES" would fit perfectly here. :O
<Glacymr> 12but
<Glacymr> 12not really

<Arcanine> 04i want to go there so badly XD
<Armageddon> 02Drake
<Armageddon> 02join the tournament via /join
<Arcanine> 04this doctor themed burger joint who names his burgers after heart surgeries because you probably are going to need it after you finish the burger
<Drake> 04?
<Armageddon> 02nwo afk
<Drake> 04I don't really want t
<Drake> 04to*
<Armageddon> 02come on xD
<Armageddon> 02I'm not in it
<Drake> 04too late
<SheenaFox> fffff, that looks like death, Glacymr
<Glacymr> 12why do you think its called a bypass burger
<Glacymr> 12you are going to need the surgery after you eat it XD
<SheenaFox> XD
<Glacymr> 12actually that is a real burger from this real burger joint i'd love to go to
<Glacymr> 12it's a doctor themed place basically you either order or you can have your appointment with the doctor and he'll check your vitals and tell you what to eat
<Glacymr> 12and as you noticed all his burgers are named after some sort of heart surgery
<Glacymr> 12the best part is that they walk you out of the building in a wheelchair lol

<Armageddon> 02heya
<Armageddon> Quantum Physics is a <censored>
<Armageddon> 02and so is string theory
<Armageddon> 02god damn philosophy
<Espeon> Quantum Physics is not a bad thing.
<Drake> 04np;\
<Drake> 04ffff
<Drake> 04freaking up key
<Drake> 04:|*
<Armageddon> 02o.o
<Armageddon> 02well it's annoying, Xeli
<Armageddon> 02especially when you have to 'accept matter doesn't exist'
<Armageddon> 02which I don't get the point of
<Armageddon> 02I don't have an opinion of matter anyway
<Armageddon> 02and when you get down to string theory
<Armageddon> 02and you find that people believe everyone/everything is made of tiny vibrating strings of energy
<Armageddon> 02and a calculation that solves everything
<Armageddon> 02you go 'wtf how can a maths equation solve everything as well as determine extra dimensions'
<Armageddon> 02so woo, my mind is on a rollercoaster
<Espeon> well I find it fascinating
<Espeon> how everything is determined on a scale that we can't comprehend
<Armageddon> 02and hensh was like the other day "I don't really care about my physical wellbeing so long as I have a healthy mental state" or something like that
<Armageddon> 02I think particle theory makes moar sense
<Drake> 04..wut
<Armageddon> 02and whee, bouncing fabric of space and strings that can HEAL CUTS IN IT YO
*Drake sticks to the fantasy theory kthnxbai
*Drake shot
<Armageddon> 02lolwut
<Armageddon> 02that typically IS fantasy
<Armageddon> 02in a way
<Armageddon> 02but it hasn't really been proved
<Armageddon> 02and that large haedron collider that's supposed to make a black hole if it works
<Armageddon> 02just makes me wtf
<Armageddon> 02it makes sense at least
<Espeon> it's supposed to recreate the big bang among other things
<Armageddon> 02but seriously, are people trying to kill everything in the name of SCIENCE?
<Espeon> well the world didn't poof when they started it
<Armageddon> 02yeah but apparently there's a theory that the big bang was created by the dimensions going bang against each other
<Armageddon> 02and it happens every now and then or something like that
<Drake> 04[19:31:42] <Drake> oh boy science
<Armageddon> 02so wonderful
<Armageddon> 02I personally don't find it that funny, Drake, lol
<Espeon> there's so many theories
<Armageddon> 02course there's a lot
<Armageddon> 02but that's kinda crazy
<Drake> 04like plenty other things I turn unfunny
<Armageddon> 02I still like the idea that we're 3 dimensional creatures and can only see things in 3 dimensions
<Espeon> well I do think there's more than one universe so \(_o)/
<Espeon> 4 dimensions if you count time
<Espeon> herpderp
<Armageddon> 02well yeah, 4 dimensions
<Armageddon> 02but then there's other stuff that can see in 5 dimensions etc.
<Drake> 04._.
<Armageddon> 02More than one universe makes sense
<Armageddon> 02string theory does not
<Espeon> well too bad our brain can't comprehend more than 4 dimensions then
<Armageddon> 02yeah
<Espeon> well it stops being logical once you enter the realm "quantum physics"
<Espeon> that's why it's not just "physics" |D
*Espeon shot
<Armageddon> 02true
<Armageddon> 02walking through walls would be fun
<Armageddon> 02but technically
<Espeon> being able to watch everything would be better
<Drake> 04Omniscience?
<Armageddon> 02Quantum physics is alright
<Armageddon> 02I don't like string theory that much though
<Armageddon> 02I find the idea of AUs alright
<Espeon> lolol
<Armageddon> 02but really
<Espeon> I actually find the whole theory that every choice creates alternate universes quite interesting.
<Armageddon> whoever comes up with random <censored> about OUR universe is a loony cock
<Espeon> infinite universes = the word "x doesn't exist" is invalid
<Armageddon> 02ok
<Armageddon> 02disregard that
<Espeon> lol WUT
<Armageddon> 02I'm ranting
<Armageddon> 02BUT
<Armageddon> 02there's stilll some really retarded theories out there
<Armageddon> 02compared to them, string theory actually makes sense
<Armageddon> 02well
<Armageddon> 02not really
<Armageddon> 02but there's also this quote "If you think you understand string theory, you don't"
<Armageddon> 02which I think would be quite true
<Espeon> the theory that the world is an advanced computer simulation is weird.
<Armageddon> 02but then again
<Espeon> and that is quite true
<Drake> 04for some reason I had an idea in my mind that every thought in our minds creates a new dimension or something...
<Armageddon> 02Drake
<Espeon> Well that's pretty much what I said
<Armageddon> 02Apparently that's one of the theories
<Espeon> but better elaborated
<Drake> 04:|
<Armageddon> 02Every choice you make creates an alternate dimension
<Espeon> universe
<Armageddon> 02in which you would have made a different choice
<Armageddon> 02well
<Armageddon> 02universe yeah
<Armageddon> 02AU
<Armageddon> 02which is an alright statement
<Espeon> tl;dr there's a world where Hitler won WW2, a world with dinosaurs and even a world with <insert anything here>
<Espeon> because infinity really screws up logic
<Armageddon> 02yep
<Drake> 04ah
<Drake> 04well
<Armageddon> 02that's sums it up really
<Drake> 04this entire convo is screwing up my mind
<Armageddon> 02Drake
<Drake> 04so I'm just gonna idle
<Armageddon> 02you DON'T do philosophy like I do
<Armageddon> 02hell, I don't even know why I took the class in the first place
<Drake> 04no
<Drake> 04I don't so philosophy at all
<Armageddon> but it rapes your mind so <censored> hard it's not funny
<Drake> 04do*
<Armageddon> 02Anyhow
<Drake> 04Nightshadow
<Armageddon> 02That also reminds me of time travel
<Drake> 04my school is catholic
<Drake> 04Religion replaces Philosophy
<Armageddon> 02apparently the further you go
<Espeon> LOL
<Espeon> In Norway that sort of schools = illegal
<Drake> 04great
<Espeon> i never understood why. they try too hard xD
<Espeon> It's fun when the parties that rule have wildly different meanings on immigration
<Drake> 04lol
<Espeon> really, they're obviously forced to find a compromise but one of them basically want to lock down Norway while the other is like "Come to us! Our country is a refugee camp!"
<Armageddon> 02o_O
<Armageddon> 02lolwut
<Espeon> and then they want to put a ban on ethnical clothing in public services and stuff
<Espeon> DRAMA
<Espeon> sleeep well
<Drake|Zzz> 04I have a feeling this convo will spill into my sleep
*Drake|Zzz hugs Espeon and Nightshadow
*Armageddon hugs Drake|Zzz back.
<Drake|Zzz> 04gnight
*Drake|Zzz poofs

<Glacymr> 12i still don't know if i want AVG or Avast
<drf|work> I prefer AVG myself
<Skylands> 10I wish I could get back into the TCG :/
<drf|work> Avast is too... simplistic
<drf|work> it's just like one giant scan button XD
<drf|work> AVG gives you more options
<drf|work> also be sure to get Malwarebytes for any heavy stuff
<Glacymr> 12heh
<Glacymr> 12hijackthis
<Glacymr> 12was complex
<Espeon> lol
<Espeon> !arcanine
*Arcanine now belongs to Espeon for 15 minutes
<Espeon> and why not get back into it? o.o
<drf|work> hijackthis doesn't actually fix your computer though
<drf|work> all it does is show you what's running and stuff
<Espeon> also yes
<Glacymr> 12i know
<Glacymr> 12it appears like you are able to submit your results to the site
<Glacymr> 12but who wants to do that
<Skylands> 10well, it costs money to collect the cards
<drf|work> LOL indeee
<drf|work> d3
<Skylands> 10I'd rather be spending it on other things
<Arcanine> 04not if you use a program like redshark
<Espeon> well true lol
<Arcanine> 04XD
<Espeon> o.o
<Espeon> what is that
<Skylands> 10What do you mean, Glacymr?
<Glacymr> 12i guess one thing that irritates me with avast
<Espeon> well merp gtg
<Glacymr> 12is that everytime it gets a really important upgrade it makes you restart
<Arcanine> 04i mean what i mean
<drf|work> heh
<drf|work> I didn't use it long enough for that to happen
<Arcanine> 04http://pokebeach.com/tcg/redshark
<Skylands> 10I don't mean to actually play though lol
*Skylands just collected the cards
<Glacymr> 12what about AVG?
<Arcanine> 04oh
<drf|work> AVG only made me reboot twice
<drf|work> in the past year
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14AVG sucks
<drf|work> orly
<drf|work> it's better than Norton and McAfee
<drf|work> and Avast is just eh
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14No it isn't
<drf|work> my work uses Trend Micro, but that's kinda retarded
<drf|work> it blocks my flash drive and say sit's a virus >_>
<drf|work> because I use autorun
<drf|work> to give it a custom icon and whatnot
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Norton and McAfee are a TON better than AVG >>
<drf|work> EWW
<drf|work> no they aren't
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Bs
<drf|work> AVG works about 95% of the time, that's better than most stuff I've seen
<drf|work> McAfee is a plain failure
<drf|work> It lets viruses by and blocks everything else -_-
<Glacymr> 12i think
<Glacymr> 12out of all the people i asked
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14AVG Killed my laptop at one point
<drf|work> LOL
<Steve> 12 Hello, Stormy|Sleeping and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Glacymr> 12everyone said AVG sucks
<Glacymr> 12except DRF
<drf|work> ATI killed my desktop at one point
<drf|work> but everyone says ATI is good
<drf|work> so like
<drf|work> yeah
<Glacymr> 12apple killed my computer at one point
<drf|work> LOL
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14AVG deletes files that aren't infected
<drf|work> yes, but you can get them back
<drf|work> and I'd rather be safe than sorry
<Glacymr> 12drf no joke
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Tell that to my laptop
<drf|work> McAfee deletes them *permanently*
<Glacymr> 12i used to have an ipod
<drf|work> AVG just puts them in a virus vault
<drf|work> you can restore them
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14McAfee gives you an option
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14>>
<drf|work> orly?
<drf|work> no it doesn't
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Yes
<drf|work> not the new one
<Glacymr> 12it glitched on me one day so i thought it had something to do with the batteries so i plugged it into the laptop and itunes just wigged out
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14It does
<drf|work> we had it at my work last year
<drf|work> I plugged in an external hard drive
<Glacymr> 12since that day
<drf|work> bam, half the drive got deleted
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14It's a setting
<Glacymr> 12my systemtray has permanently vanished
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Wow drf how fail are you :|
<drf|work> yeah but if you're not an admin
<drf|work> and the computer has McAfee
<drf|work> you're f***ed.
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14...
<Glacymr> 12until i reinstalled windows lol
<drf|work> point being
<drf|work> no antivirus is perfect.
<Glacymr> 12that's why
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Antiviruses are just useless anyway
<Glacymr> 12you download and install 3 Antiviruses :D
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I don't use any of em anymore
<drf|work> LOL no
<drf|work> LLOTS, same
<drf|work> I disabled AVG LOL
<drf|work> It's just there as an on demand scanner
<drf|work> as is Malwarebytes
<drf|work> it's nice to ahve them installed, but not running
<Glacymr> 12i dunno
<drf|work> but Glacymr, no, if you have more than one antiviruses running at once they start causing problems
<drf|work> so don't do that XD
<Glacymr> 12avast has helped me plenty of time with its realtime scanners
<drf|work> so has AVG
<Glacymr> 12like when websurfing and blahblah
<drf|work> but I got mad at one point because I got a keygen that kept getting deleted LOL
<drf|work> so I shut it off
<Airwolve> easy way: find a keygen that doesn't get deleted, or even better, a key.
<Glacymr> 12yay
<Glacymr> 12so much for AVG
<Glacymr> 12it's worrying more about your software being legal
<Glacymr> 12instead of being safe from viruses
<drf|work> LOL
<drf|work> Airwolve, well, sometimes there's no better option
<Glacymr> 12its like your mothr
<drf|work> so I just shut off AVG's realtime scanner
<Glacymr> 12*mother
<drf|work> and never bothered to turn it back on

<Glacymr> 12because the dehalop
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14</random>
<Glacymr> 12happened at different times
<Draelen> if it does it again I'll change it's modes

<Aurora> 6LOL
<Aurora> 6dehalop WUT
<Aurora> 6where's the f
<Sneas> 03So I got a ripped $5 bill and the security strip was hanging out and I was curious and it just, well, popped out
<Glacymr> 12it'd range from 2 to like 8 seconds
<Draelen> eggdrops and etc can have settings which automatically remove modes
<Sneas> 03Hi xD
<Draelen> I've a feeling you're getting trolled though Aurora ;p
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14by the way Aurora
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14[19:59] * StatsBot sets mode: -h Aurora
*Aurora 6is tempted to kick StatsBot just for revenge
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14You doe realize that an Admin is doing that :P
<Aurora> 6...no I don't o-o
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14XD
<Feather> 10Yeah XD
*Aurora 6glares at Draelen
<Draelen> cubes the bot assigned by chanserv ;p
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14It's probably Draelen messing around :P
<Draelen> StatsBot is run by arti as far as I know
<Tiel> Hi o3o
<Tiel> and eep o-o
<Draelen> if I tell chanserv to voice me:
<Aurora> 6Arti's at the beach today though
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Draelen: You still have access to botserv and operserv :P
<Draelen> I cannot make others talk
<Draelen> without a module installed
*Sneas can't put it back D:
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Draelen: YOU OWN one of the servers for TST
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14:P
*LugiaLordOfTheSeas isn't silly
<Draelen> I can make any services bot talk, but StatsBot is not a services bot
<Aurora> 6llots of course you're silly
*Aurora 6runs
<Draelen> it's a controlled bot running on someones system
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14inb4 /msg operserv mode #channel modes
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14;P
<Draelen> that will make the mode originate from operserv, it's server, or one of it's fake users, such as cube
<Glacymr> 12lol
<Draelen> it will fail if you source it from a fake direction
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14You can still use operserv to use botserv access :P
<Draelen> yes, but I can't make modes originate from StatsBot, which was happening earlier
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14VNC
*LugiaLordOfTheSeas shot
<Draelen> I have no VNC access ;p
<Draelen> I only ask for those details if I'm helping arti with something
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14lol
<Draelen> and LugiaLordOfTheSeas, run the /module command on both the servers
<Draelen> you'll see that sendraw is not installed ;p
<Draelen> or at least it should not be
<SparkART> 2whee
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I don't have access to that sort of command :P
<SparkART> 2Drawing Twil's sona is fun :D
<Draelen> you do ;p
<Draelen> anyone does
<Tiel> DDD:
<Draelen> /operserv raw :StatsBot MODE #SilverWings -o Draelen
<Draelen> this command fails
<Draelen> /operserv raw :cube MODE #SilverWings -o Draelen
<Draelen> that however works
<Tiel> Maybe you could take them both to a bank or something and have it be exchanged maybe? XD
<Draelen> if you run /stats T, you'll see "wrong direction 5 empty 19"
<Draelen> wrong direction will increment by one for every time I attempt to fake something from StatsBot
<Draelen> and is ignored

*Quilava humps Sneas
<Arcanine> 04lol Quilava
<Quilava> hm?
<Arcanine> 04funny thing happened, >_>
<Arcanine> 04i'm sitting here near the end of the match
<Arcanine> 04the person i laned with was a gangplank
<TimeShift> hi and ew - still no Cuno here
<Arcanine> 04and he complained about someone stealing his kill
<Arcanine> 04guess what
<Arcanine> 04my record was 4/2/12 because of him XD
<Quilava> lol
<Arcanine> 04i love that irony
<drf|work> she was here earlier looking for you XD
<Arcanine> 04the guy who took like 8 or 9 kills from me
<Arcanine> 04complained about 1 kill being taken from him
<Quilava> SOUNDS AWESOME
<Arcanine> 04i didn't care
<Arcanine> 04i just laughed it off
<TimeShift> ...
<TimeShift> ...and I was at the airschool
<TimeShift> learning to fly...well....all the technology so I'm allowed to
<Quilava> though he could have been trying to get a new highest kill count
<TimeShift> learning how an altimeter, a turn indicator and such works
<Quilava> but still
<Arcanine> 04i'm starting to get used to nasus
<Arcanine> 04he is just mean as heck
<Arcanine> 04the fact i can easily dragon at 6
<Arcanine> 04wither and spirit fire
<Quilava> good for teaming I suppose
<Arcanine> 04spirit fire has so many uses
<Arcanine> 04keeps them away from farming while helping you farm as well
<Aristeo> :o
<Quilava> good vs ganking groups too
<Arcanine> 04perhaps
<Quilava> its got a pretty large area
<Arcanine> 04wither has a LARGE area as well
<Quilava> is it AoE?
<Arcanine> 04no
<Arcanine> 04i'm just saying it has a lot of range
<Quilava> thats what I meant
<Curly> hey Ari ^^
<Arcanine> 04i know
<Arcanine> 04really
<Arcanine> 04the only problem i have with Nasus is that i'm never sure when to whip out the ultimate
<Quilava> that goes for almost anyone though.
<Quilava> just get cooldown reductions so you can use it more often
<Arcanine> 04not really
<Arcanine> 04i mean look at teemo
<Quilava> ALMOST anyone
<Arcanine> 04i think nasus is among the hardest though
<Quilava> use it when the enemy is slowed/stunned? or when they will be?
<SparkART> 2 o-o
<Arcanine> 04i usuall use it for defense
<Arcanine> 04like if i think i'm going to die, i whip out the ultimate with hopes of surviving
<Quilava> doesn't work well against anything with range though
<Arcanine> 04i wear boots of swiftness
<Arcanine> 04plus i usually get zeal mid to late game
<Michel> wb quil :P
<Arcanine> 04to help build trinity forc
<Arcanine> 04*force
<Arcanine> 04then i have wither, with that build, nasus has plenty of escape options
<Arcanine> 04then to be even more safe i equip clense
*Michel pokes Quilava
<Arcanine> 04that has helped me out of so many tight spots
*Arcanine rubs against Michel
<Arcanine> 04:3
*Michel runs
<Arcanine> 04of course run, like you always do :(

<Arcanine> 04i think they shut off 5v5 battling for a few minutes
<Michel> 5vs5 queue is up again :P

<Arcanine> 04i guess they like european people more :P
<Quilava> it took the patcher a minute or two to register that it was actually online
<Quilava> and it doesn't effect anyone who's already online.
<Michel> i gues i was online BEFORE the log in server was busy :P
<Quilava> it just doesn't allow more to connect

<Arcanine> 04or does it have to be shut down and started up again to see new status
<Quilava> the patcher doesn't update it automatically

<Tuffy> 04When I watched this video, the person told me to imagine this problem I had, wrote it on a journal, crumpled up that paper with the problem and put it in the fireplace
<Brother> Was about to do Oblivion LP but with a storm I dont want the computer to blow up in my face
<Quilava> like the server is marked busy if X people are online
<Tuffy> 04And when that feeling came, I thought I was laughing in an evil way
<Michel> dont think so
<Brother> "throwing paper in fire; another way to the dark side?"
<Brother> so i'm just going to watch Deus Ex
<Michel> it was only ever busy/unavailable if they are restarting or have troubles with it
<Michel> *were
<Tuffy> 04No, I just imagined banishing my stress into the inner pits of Hell.
<Michel> me is in :P
<Quilava> usually 'busy' means.. the server is busy
<Tuffy> 04Then again, it could be
<Brother> just dont sing hellfire then

*Arcanine disabled LugiaLordOfTheSeas with that burger
<Proto> Now plz change your nick
<Proto> my netbook screen has optimized tiny xchat
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14.
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Seriously that isn't helping
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14also for those that actually care my server is back up and running
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14irc.starlightdragon.co.cc 9001
<Quilava> LLOTS: delete the account?
<Tiel> disabling is exactly the same as just leaving your account alone
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Delete waht account?
<Tiel> If you want it to actually go away, you have to delete it
<Quilava> facebook.
<Tiel> which is sort of convoluted
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I disable it
<Quilava> and yeah.. 'disable' is the same as 'log out and don't come back'
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Yeah Quilava
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I'll do that
<Tiel> Everyone can still see your page and stuff
<Quilava> DELETE the account
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Facebook pisses me off anyway
<Tiel> here, since it's sort of hard to find where you actually delete your account, I'll give you a link
<Quilava> you can google it. there's like a million walkthroughs for it
<Quilava> ever since people found out they sell your personal information
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Guys I really don't care :\
<Tiel> I don't know the situation, just randomly looked over here and thought I'd try to help sort of xD
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I really couldn't care less if my facebook was deleted or not
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Chances are I will be leaving the internet for a while anyway :|
<Quilava> how come?
<Creideiki> Good relative evening peoples.
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I dunno
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I need space
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I guees
<Quilava> hmm :/ ok
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14My Dad really hit me where it hurt today so yeh
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Though meh
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14He is going to regret it
<Tiel> D:
*Tiel hugs?
*LugiaLordOfTheSeas hugs back
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14To be honest
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14At this current point
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14you guys are my family
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Though chances are that I will completely give up on the net
<Quilava> eh?
<Quilava> how come?
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I just don't have the mental capacity to care for the internet anymore
<Quilava> :/
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I've had so much crap from my family
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I can't deal with it anymore
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I know my own Dad completely disowned me
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14But he blamed me for something
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Something that really damn hurt me
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> <censored> it
<Quilava> sorry to hear about that :(
<Quilava> ><
<Arcanine> 04sigh he doesn't see the contradiction in his logic
<Quilava> nobody does.
<Arcanine> 04if we are like family to him
<Twilight> 14OMG
<Twilight> 14BEST PIC EVER <3
<Arcanine> 04then we are like best friends as well and in a situation like that, friends is what you need the most
<Saphira> 12Arcanine, try being in my position right now
<Creideiki> Apparently, the server with the SSL connection dropped on me...
<Saphira> 12then maybe you'll see why I'm so pissed off
<Creideiki> (I feel so insecure not being on an encrypted channel.)
<Twilight> 14http://i124.photobucket.com/albums/p14/StarLe19/Pokemon/Manga/hubuki.jpg <--- <3
<Arcanine> 04so your family dislikes you

<Lambda> Stormy!
<Stormy> Oh yeah, that reminds me
<Stormy> Did I tell you guys about the guy who was asking me to make him an oper?
<Stormy> it was weird
<Lambda> XD
<Lambda> Was it dlsabi?
<Lambda> :P
<Stormy> No
<Stormy> Some guy named SID
<Lambda> *djsabi
<Lambda> SID
<Lambda> hmmm
<Stormy> He had an... interesting way of speaking
*Quilava hugs on LLOTS
<Lambda> example?
<Stormy> I'll see if I can find the log
<Stormy> But first he was like, "how do i ircop?"
*LugiaLordOfTheSeas snuggles against Quilava
<Quilava> anything I could do to help you feel better?
<Lambda> And then he was all "awwww"
<Stormy> then I told him Aristeo had to make him one, and later he asked me for my password
<Lambda> O.o
<Aicebo> LOL
<Lambda> wtf
<Stormy> And I was like "...no"
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Not really no :<
<Lambda> :P
<Stormy> :P
<Aicebo> it's like those people on youtube that PM you and say "can i borrow your account? i need to see something"
<Stormy> o.O
<Lambda> Yeah, who do they think they're fooling
<Lambda> people don't just give their passwords out
<Aicebo> apparently, a lot of people DO fall for it
<Aicebo> which is pathetic
<Aicebo> :'D
<Lambda> wow
<Quilava> aww
<Aicebo> "but it's important please"
<Stormy> Yeah, because I'm totally going to give some random dude I've never even seen before control over a good portion of the network
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14SHOULD have a RL friend coming on
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14very soon
<Lambda> That makes perfect sense :D
<Lambda> Hey Stormy

<Quilava> ^^
<Lambda> wow, what a weird individual
<Lambda> this coming from someone who is also a weird individual
<Aicebo> reminds me of those pakistani people
<Lambda> Hahahaha
<Lambda> they were cooler though
<Lambda> speaking of which
<Lambda> I wonder if they're still around...
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14If he wasn't so IRC dumb LOL
<Lambda> [18:19] ->> You were removed from #funnypaki : Bad channel key (+k)

*LugiaLordOfTheSeas shot
<RedDragonX> I've seen plenty of interesting words
<Lambda> RDX: yeah that's the one :D
<Boof> lol and how so
<Stormy> kind of odd that after we all start joining they set a key
<Stormy> =/
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Everyone is quiet D:
<Quilava> squeak
<Lambda> lol, they really just wanted a private channel for paki people
<Lambda> for what reason, I dunno
<Stormy> because Americans are evil
<Stormy> obviously
<Stormy> :P
<Lambda> :P
<Lambda> I forgot
<Aicebo> StOrMy CaN i sEe Ur ApPle???
<Stormy> I almost got to help set up the demo game consoles at work today
<RedDragonX> lok, I'm still in there
<Lambda> or maybe they were offended with America because you didn't reveal your face
<Stormy> Aicebo: NOWAI
<Lambda> Woah cool
<Kipikipo> Don't tell me what I have to love!
<Lambda> I would love that job
<Lambda> RDX: Can you decipher the password
<Lambda> :P
<RedDragonX> prolly wouldn't go over very well lol
<Lambda> :P
<Stormy> we had a group of like 4 people doing that
<RedDragonX> besides it's prolly just Allah Haffiz or something
<Lambda> Yeah, probably not
<Lambda> XD
<Lambda> Allah Ackbar
<RedDragonX> yeah
<Lambda> or something along those lines
<Stormy> But a supervisor told me to let the men to it :(
<Lambda> :(
<RedDragonX> 0.o
<Lambda> SEXIST!
<RedDragonX> lol Wal Mart
<Lambda> :P
<Lambda> I work alongside a Minnesota equivalent of you RDX
<Stormy> And they had no idea what they were doing so it took them like an hour
<Stormy> XD
<Lambda> XD
<Lambda> ironic
<Lambda> I bet you would've been able to figure it out way faster
<Stormy> probably lol
<Glacymr> 12hmm
<Stormy> And keep in mind this was with step-by-step instructions
*Glacymr gives Kipikipo some lettuce
<Stormy> XD
<Lambda> XD
<Lambda> It's simple really
<Stormy> I saw them still there like an hour later
*Kipikipo balances on it
<Lambda> red cord goes to red slot
<Lambda> white to white
<Lambda> etc.
<Stormy> well, it was a little more complicated than that
<Stormy> there were a few extra cables and stuff
<Lambda> for the controllers I guess
<Stormy> yeah
<Lambda> since they can't be wireless
<Stormy> And some thing called a "Medusa"
<Stormy> whatever that is
<Lambda> Hmm
<Lambda> It turns those who can't set it up to stone
<Lambda> hence the reason they took so long
<Stormy> :O
<RedDragonX> what dare I ask is a Minnesota equivalent of me?
<Lambda> The Coke vendor
<RedDragonX> lol
<Lambda> he comes in every week
<Glacymr> 12the lettuce smells like cookies
<RedDragonX> must be a convenient store
<Lambda> like this morning for example
<Stormy> All Coke vendors are RDX
<Stormy> :P
<Lambda> nah, Walmart
<RedDragonX> then he should be in there every day
<Tiel> ohai new person 8D
<RedDragonX> not once a week
<Lambda> oh yeah
<Lambda> he probably is
*Tiel tacklehugs the new person.
<RedDragonX> Wal Mart would have a heart attack if a Coke vendor only showed up once a week
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14XD
<Lambda> I never pay much attention because I don't directly work with him
<Lambda> lol, true
<RedDragonX> and no
<Lambda> even in a small town
<RedDragonX> if all vendors would me then they would look better
<Stormy> lol
<Glacymr> 12and cheesecake
<Lambda> maybe the one I work with is good looking
<Lambda> I dunno
<Boof> and so it begins XD
<Aeroslash> O.o
<Stormy> why not?
<Glacymr> 12it's special grown lettuce o-o
<Lambda> I'm not one who knows these things
<Aeroslash> okaaayyy then XD
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Orly
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14:P
<RedDragonX> typically it will be different vendors as part timers
<RedDragonX> and one full timer
*Quilava blegh...
<RedDragonX> who does the orders
<Lambda> I'll have to ask a female coworker if he is
<RedDragonX> while part timers work weekends
<Boof> as a great creature once said Pikachu pika pika
<Lambda> "Is the Coke guy hawt?"
<Lambda> I'd look crazy
<Stormy> "omigawd ya like totally"
<Quilava> not feeling so good all of a sudden ><
<Lambda> lol, all my female coworkers are like 60
<Lambda> XD
<Stormy> LOL
<Stormy> OK, maybe not then :P
<Boof> ^_^
<Lambda> there are a couple younger ones I think
<Lambda> all the ones I see all the time are old though
<Stormy> literally everyone on my team smokes
<RedDragonX> too bad 95% of the chicks in my town are ugly bats
<Stormy> except for one other person
<Lambda> Hahahaha
<Lambda> RDX: XD that does suck
<Lambda> And Stormy
<Lambda> It's the same with the nightshift crew it seems
<Stormy> they're all ugly bats or they all smoke?
<Lambda> smoke
<Lambda> and probably ugly bats
<Stormy> haha
<Lambda> but they can't help that
<Lambda> they're too old
<Lambda> ::P
<Stormy> :::::P
<Stormy> Mine has more eyes than yours
<Lambda> Lol, I've created a new typo craze
<Lambda> Mine has gla censored cat sses
<RedDragonX> Why does Wal Mart put the people with the worst looking teeth as greeters?
<Aicebo> LOL
<Lambda> LOL
<Lambda> I dunno
<RedDragonX> seriously
<RedDragonX> it disturbs me
<Lambda> here they just give that job to the handicapped
<Stormy> Because old people have bad teeth
<Lambda> I never noticed their teeth
<RedDragonX> not just old people
<Stormy> And only old people ever work there
<RedDragonX> actually
<RedDragonX> I've noticed the older greeters looked better then the middle aged ones
<RedDragonX> they all have black crooked teeth that look ready to fall out
<Stormy> how lovely
<Stormy> Maybe it's because they smoke
<Lambda> probably
<Lambda> because all Walmart employees smoke too
<Stormy> I swear 95% of people who work for Walmart smoke
<Stormy> Why, I have no idea
<Lambda> it really does seem that way
<Tiel> D:
<Stormy> the door greeter job must be so boring
<Lambda> they have to clean the windows too
<Stormy> just stand in one place for 4 hours at a time and say goodbye to people
<Lambda> but yeah, that's still not much to do
<Stormy> And stop shoplifters occasionally

<InfamousZed> ha
<Stormy> this was a random idea he had while driving me home yesterday
<Stormy> don't ask me :P
<Lambda> lol, and after thinking upon it more it seems genious
<Stormy> it would be funny
<Lambda> Lol, it's impossible to track my train of thought
<InfamousZed> that just brings phinox right up into my head
<Lambda> even for me

<Theguesst> And gets only 2 hours
<Theguesst> And I spent those 2 hours watching a webstream with another irc client
<Theguesst> How about a portable alternative that I can sleep with.
<drfsupercenter> 03Droid/
*drfsupercenter hides
<Theguesst> Like right now, I'm resting in bed
<Saphira> 12Droid is the best alternative
<Theguesst> I still have another year on my contract
<Theguesst> AT&T
<Theguesst> And it's a crappy free phone
<Theguesst> With an even worse touch screen than any iPhone.
<Theguesst> Capacitive, as technical minded people call it.
<Theguesst> That's the iPhone
<Theguesst> And the other kind is transistive, that's like the ds
<Theguesst> And that's my phone
<drfsupercenter> 03off to bed
<Theguesst> Besides that, I don't think my parents would even pay any more than 30 a month for a phone.
<Theguesst> Even though my dad wants a droid >_>
<drfsupercenter> 03Droid IS 30 a month

*Aristeo listens
<Conall`Curach> "What Aristeo is doing in #epic-chat is completely irresponsible, and he should be appalled at the scale of the disaster that he has caused. I think that he should redouble his efforts to clean up this spill."
*Aristeo starts a PR campaign to rebrand his image
<Aristeo> :D
*Conall`Curach launches an awareness campaign, showing the devastation in #epic-chat. Photos of Raine and NightHawk and Stormy covered in oil appear all over the channels.
<NightHawk> o.0
*Aristeo pours more money in the PR campaign, while the CEO of Aristeo is standing on the beach with his sleeves rolled up next to a shovel, inspiring music playing in the background
*Conall`Curach sets up a flatscreen behind the CEO showing oil washing up on the beach.
*Aristeo waits for a celebrity to die or for something more catastrophic to happen so everyone will just forget about that time when Aristeo pumped thousands of barrels of oil into the channel -- kind of like that time when everyone forgot that people's brakes were failing

<eXAKR> Actually, as soon as it frees, its mad. So then, it unleashes its full fury and unleashes the power of POKEMON HELL! You see a hundred cursed mews drag your Pokemon slowly into a pit of boiling Pichu blood.
<eXAKR> Quietly, the tendrils of a mutilated Deoxys wraps around your feet, and slowly pulls you to the event horizon. Arceus laughs as all light disappears from your vision, and you feel the blades of a demon Scyther cut open your chest, and take your heart.
<eXAKR> Welcome? to hell...
<eXAKR> And they shall call it "Pokemon Black".

<Brother> :p
<Shadowabsol> 14:(
<Aeroslash> cops don't like me much either

<Shadowabsol> 14They get used to that here.
<Brother> and who drive in in their space? p
<Aeroslash> i got screamed at for riding on a road once XD
<Shadowabsol> 14Because almost everyone owns one. XD
<Aeroslash> not funny at the time, but now i'm like "whatever, I just wanna drive my wheeler"

<Aurora> 6"don't blow up the house...by some extras for us"
<drf|work> LOL
<drf|work> and hm
<Aurora> 6SURE THING 8D
<drf|work> do you use your real name on FB? o.o
<Aurora> 6yes
<drf|work> weird
<Aurora> 6why
<drf|work> because I was bored one day
<drf|work> went to Articuno's friend list
<drf|work> searched your first name
<Aurora> 6...LOL
<drf|work> nothing
<Aurora> 6..
<Brother> XD
<Aurora> 6what day?
<drf|work> it it like superuberprivate or somethign?
<drf|work> um, a few weeks ago
<Aurora> 6no, I don't think so o-o;
<Skylands> 10I found Roara's through Arti's xD
<drf|work> it showed 3 people but none of them looked anything like you XD
<Aurora> 6LOL
<drf|work> not to mention two lived in teh UK
<drf|work> the other was totally private
<Aurora> 6lol teh
<drf|work> hm
<Brother> Teh Britannia :P
<drf|work> I'm not a stalker, i was just curious :P
<Skylands> 10Can I add you on FB, Aurora?
<Brother> oh sure you say that DRF
*Brother hides
<Shadowabsol> 14Oh, Facebook...
<Aurora> 6no, I don't add people on here to my facebook for very plain reasons
<Aurora> 6Arti is an exception I'd rather not explain
<Brother> curioisity kills the...internet person?
<Skylands> 10k
<drf|work> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zX09WnGU6ZY&feature=player_embedded <- fixed video link
<drf|work> and eh
<drf|work> why, just because you only add IRL people?
<Aurora> 6brb, calling clark pest control x-x
<Shadowabsol> 14Don't kill it! D:
<Aurora> 6drf, because my parents would chop my up and feed me to the rats in my attic if they learned about me being online like this lOL
<Aurora> 6they're very anti-chatroom
<drf|work> LOL
<drf|work> do you have to tell them it was a chatroom though?
<drf|work> also, this is why not having your parents as friends on Facebook is useful
*drf|work runs
<Aurora> 6how else will I explain like 20 people from random parts of the country
<drf|work> forum?
<Aurora> 6they already asked about aRTI
<Aurora> 6Arti
<drf|work> my parents just don't care anymore
<Shadowabsol> 14How did you explain Arti?
<Shadowabsol> 14same here
<drf|work> just be like, "I'm an adult, I do what i want"
<Aurora> 6she was a friend of a friend of mine who was visiting the country
<Aurora> 6worked decently enough
<drf|work> LOL
<Shadowabsol> 14witty
<Skylands> 10Parents checking your Facebook is kinda sad tbh, but eh
<Kyu> 07lol
<drf|work> do they actually look through your friends list on a regular basis? o.o
<Aurora> 6it wasn't checking like "lets make sure she's safe"
<Skylands> 10ah
<Aurora> 6they saw one of arti's comments that said "YOU'RE A PEAAAAAAAAAADGE LOOOOOOOL"
<Aurora> 6and basically went wtf
<drf|work> XD
<Shadowabsol> 14still kind of creepy
<Shadowabsol> 14I'm fifteen and my parents don't even care that much. :/
<Aurora> 6yeah, I have to be careful what I say -_-;
<drf|work> my parents basically said they'd ban me from the internet if I made a Facebook
<drf|work> so I made one
<drf|work> and didn't tell them
<drf|work> XD
<drf|work> eventually my mom found out like a year later and was like w/e
<Aurora> 6._.
<Shadowabsol> 14My parents ENCOURAGED me to make a Facebook!
<drf|work> now my mom let my 13 year old sister make one
<Aurora> 6ok, they let you hack computers, chat online, and be an expert pirate
<drf|work> she got more friends on there in a single day than I have total >_>

*Aurora 6needs chips and salsa
<Brother> You should have named him Bob :P
<SheenaFox|Afk> You should put an "Al" before the "fred"
<Brother> it'd be such the hilarious fallout reference
<Aurora> 6fred is cooler
<Shadowabsol> 14Fred is an awesome name for a Venus Flytrap.

<drf|work> I KNOW
<drf|work> I need to organize one of those at my dorm
<Aurora> 6freaking japan
<drf|work> I'm just curious where the red lights came from
<Aurora> 6I've seen a red light room in my area
<Aurora> 6every time I come home from work
<drf|work> heh
<drf|work> but the rooms change from red to white
<Shadowabsol> 14When I live in a dorm, I'm going to put bright blue lights in it just to confuse people.
<Aurora> 6this room does too
<drf|work> http://epicwinftw.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/129162776379082002.jpg <-- LOOOOOL
<drf|work> I wanna do that
<drf|work> and o.o
<Aurora> 6I guess they must have one red and one white bulb
<drf|work> you can turn your room red? Why?
<drf|work> hm
<Aurora> 6HOLY CRAP V-MAX
<Andrew> that looks... vertical
<Aurora> 6only, OPEN
<drf|work> V-Max?
<Aurora> 6drf, I've ridden a slide like that
<Aurora> 6it was called v-max
<Shadowabsol> 14SOMEONE must have fallen off that thing before...
<drf|work> oh
<Aurora> 6most epic waterslide ever
*Aeroslash OMFGs at DRF's pic
<drf|work> I wanna ride one
<Aurora> 6 9 stories tall, near vertical drop
<drf|work> NICE
<Aurora> 6guarenteed wedgie at the end
<Aeroslash> XD
<Aeroslash> otherwise you get your money back? XP
<Shadowabsol> 14I would never ride anything like that...
<Aeroslash> same XD
<J-Lugia> hi Aero
<Aeroslash> hai J!
<J-Lugia> I would! XD
<Shadowabsol> 14It looks like someone could fall right off!!
<Aurora> 6SA, I said that for the longest time
<Aurora> 6until my mom managed to get me to climb up to the top with her
<Aurora> 6I chickened out and then realized something
<drf|work> http://epicwinftw.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/129159992359987275.jpg
<Aurora> 6I'd have to climb 9 stories back down
<Aurora> 6or spend 4 seconds sliding
<Aurora> 6the slide was way more fun once you got on XD
<Shadowabsol> 14Yes, but I'm afraid of falling...
<Aurora> 6the one drf posted was open though...
<Brother> Aurora: tha reminds me of NRH2O
<Aurora> 6v-max was closed for the first half of the slide
<Brother> only I didnt know how tall this ride was
<Aurora> 6the second half was open
<drf|work> oh
<drf|work> open
<drf|work> I thought you meant like
<drf|work> open for business
<drf|work> I get what you mean now XD
<Brother> you'd have to go up some 10 sections of stairs
<Brother> so it was nutoriously the longest waiting line in the world
*Aeroslash omgs
<Aeroslash> i could imagine XD
<Brother> but worth it, down virticully and go in all different directions
*Shadowabsol 14shivers.
<Shadowabsol> 14sounds horrible
<Aurora> 6man, I can't even show you an image of the slide
<Brother> its fun-orrible
<drf|work> hm?
<drf|work> why?
<Aurora> 6see, the park closed down in 2004, and it seems that NO ONE bothered to take pictures before then and put it online >_>
<drf|work> oh
<Brother> >>
<drf|work> did they close down due to any deaths or injuries on that slide?
<Brother> thats lame
*drf|work hies
<drf|work> *hides
<Aurora> 6that park was the best waterpark E-V-E-R
<Brother> drf: NRH2O, had several dehydrations

<drfsupercenter> 03oh, this is just great
<drfsupercenter> 03School of Rock is airing on TBS HD (I want an HD recording)
<drfsupercenter> 03TBS is the ONLY station that doesn't work :(
<drfsupercenter> 03For me
<drfsupercenter> 03it comes in silent LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03I get picture but no sound
<drfsupercenter> 03which is kinda... useless for recording stuff
<Aeroslash> lol yeah
<Aeroslash> and why doesn't TBS work for you?
*Aeroslash loves that channel ^^
<drfsupercenter> 03Dunno
<drfsupercenter> 03I had the cable company over here TWICE
<drfsupercenter> 03They're like "It's not our fault"
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm like, I can PROVE that it's your fault
<drfsupercenter> 03and they guy saw the picture I made
<drfsupercenter> 03and was like
<drfsupercenter> 03that's not our fault
<drfsupercenter> 03>_>
<Aeroslash> meh
<Aeroslash> cable companys
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03I REALLY hate Turner networks' HD channels at times
<drfsupercenter> 03as they fricking stretch everything :@
<drfsupercenter> 03like they call shows like Family Guy HD
<drfsupercenter> 03when they aren't
<drfsupercenter> 03>_>
<drfsupercenter> 03same with Home Improvement, TBS *RUINED* That
<Alek> I hate how they stretch programs and think people aren't going to notice
<Alek> which is the sad truth a lot of the time
<drfsupercenter> 03Yeah -_-
<drfsupercenter> 03my friend was like
<drfsupercenter> 03"You mean Family Guy ISN'T widescreen?"
<drfsupercenter> 03I was like um, yes?
<Aeroslash> I have Dish, they're an okay company
<drfsupercenter> 03EW SATELLITE
<drfsupercenter> 03I made a picture this morning
<drfsupercenter> 03because I was bored
<Alek> EW DRF
<Alek> I have antenna >:V
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, over the air is cool
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway
<drfsupercenter> 03http://images.cheezburger.com/completestore/2010/6/29/0cf49c5d-5289-4f60-b2b6-574007c7b8c4.png
<Alek> We had cable
<drfsupercenter> 03well I hvae reasons for hating satellite companies
<Alek> it sucked
<Alek> :V
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean
<drfsupercenter> 03cable is kinda evil too
<drfsupercenter> 03BUT
<drfsupercenter> 03There's benefits
<drfsupercenter> 03the number one thing for me is analog cable
<drfsupercenter> 03we have like 4 TVs
<drfsupercenter> 03we only pay for digital cable on one
<drfsupercenter> 03:)
<drfsupercenter> 03if you have satellite, good luck with that LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03plus I can record HD stuff on my computer
<Aeroslash> XD yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03you also can't do that with satllite
<drfsupercenter> 03so yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03I have my reasons
<Aeroslash> I didn't ask for it
<Aeroslash> i hate it too
<drfsupercenter> 03the number one reason I hate it is having to pay for a receiver box for EVERY TV
<drfsupercenter> 03with cable you only need one if you want HD
<Aeroslash> i know -.-
<drfsupercenter> 03and since we only have one HDTV
<drfsupercenter> 03we only hv eone box
<Alek> recording via computer on sattelite is doable
<Alek> :V
<drfsupercenter> 03how?
<drfsupercenter> 03in HD?
<Alek> yes :V
<drfsupercenter> 03I just put a cablecard in my computer
<drfsupercenter> 03Satellite doesn't use cablecards
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<drfsupercenter> 03you'd have to pay for a receiver
<drfsupercenter> 03then use some obscure method
<drfsupercenter> 03to do it
<Alek> "splitter", for one
<Alek> they make those :0
<drfsupercenter> 03Alek, splitter how?
<drfsupercenter> 03...
<drfsupercenter> 03the problem with that
<drfsupercenter> 03you can only watch one chanenl
<drfsupercenter> 03*channel
<drfsupercenter> 03my grandparents do that LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03they have Dish, and like 3 TVs
<drfsupercenter> 03and they can only watch one station
<Alek> I don't mean split to two TVs
<drfsupercenter> 03on any given TV
<drfsupercenter> 03then what?
<Alek> Split one to a recording system thing :V
<drfsupercenter> 03...
<Alek> you're watching the program anyway
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<drfsupercenter> 03not really
<drfsupercenter> 03Often times I record one thing as I'm watching something else at the same time
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Alek> I'd use it to just record while I'm not watching :V
<drfsupercenter> 03well regardless
<Alek> but, I have virtually nothing here :V
<drfsupercenter> 03you still need to record it through the analog hjole or whatever
<drfsupercenter> 03-j
<drfsupercenter> 03you can't rip stuff directly off the dish
<drfsupercenter> 03I can do it with cable :P
<Alek> we don't have sattelite anymore, anyway
<drfsupercenter> 03we never had it, XD
<Alek> my parents were thinking of getting a TiVo, which I was trying to get them to not do because I was saying I could just build a system that does basically the same thing
<Alek> :V
<drfsupercenter> 03we've had cable my whole life
<drfsupercenter> 03literally, when my parents bought the house back in 1987, the previous owners had Comcrap
<drfsupercenter> 03and were like here, just pay for it if you want it
<drfsupercenter> 03so they did
<Alek> we had cable when I was young, and it went out every time there was a drizzle
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Aeroslash> lol I remember cable at my dads old house
<drfsupercenter> 03and back in around 2002 we switched to WideOpenWest
<drfsupercenter> 03and never went back
<drfsupercenter> 03WOW is quite an awesome cable company :)
<Alek> And they don't service my area
<Alek> :V

<Tiel> Chikorita has the same gender ratio as Bulbasaur
<Brother> a woman who has NEVEr heard of any good vampire books/movies
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14lol

<Brother> decides to make a book where vampires sparkly
<Brother> its obviously the work of a 'extreme' fan girl :P
<Creideiki> Dracula is, depening on the film, on the "awesomeness" scale, somewhere between: "Woah!" and "Holy <bleep>!" :P
*Tiel is probably just stupid and this is common knowledge xD
<Light_Lati> if Edward, Jaspar and Emmett are homo, why are their mates FEMALE?
<Light_Lati> @drf
<Brother> because they need to be hidden :P
<Light_Lati> ...
<Light_Lati> that makes no sense
<Brother> that and I dont think sparkling men= gay
<Brother> LL: erm..ever heard of a closet something
<drf|laptop> 03<Light_Lati> if Edward, Jaspar and Emmett are homo, why are their mates FEMALE? <-- because they're not quite sure of their gayness yet?
<Light_Lati> then why mate with women?
<drf|laptop> 03and are just using girls as a cover?
*drf|laptop runs
<drf|laptop> 03that's actually common
<Brother> they're bi?
<Light_Lati> lol
*Brother hides
<Light_Lati> that is possible Brother

<Theguesst> Well, I'm tempted to leave this place for good since the discontinuation of the forums and the traffic drop from the format switch. It's like a sinking ship now. Unfortunately, the only way off is to jump early or go down with it and face all the time you wasted here.

<EpicStatsGuy> 14,15 Welcome to the Federation Starship SS Buttcrack.
*Lugianite waves to Presea
<Presea> hi
<Lugianite> how are you?
<Presea> half awake
<Lugianite> long time no chat ^^
<Presea> just woke up
<Presea> ya
<Lugianite> nice
<TerrorBite> hey guys
<Presea> hi
<Shiny> Lyon's here?
<TerrorBite> I'm a lion if that helps
<Shiny> mmk
<Dream05560> i believe so Shiny
<Shiny> I got somethin to show him and he's not even here? >:/
<Kyro> it shows he's here, but he's probably AFK
<Shiny> Makes sense for what time it is, but I would expect a name change then
<Kyro> agreed
<J-Lugia> Nickelback FTW!
<Shiny> agreed?
<Kyro> i agreed with you that there should have been a name change
<Lugianite> just do /whois
<Shiny> Not what I meant
<Presea> ?
<Shiny> Lyon's just one who changes his name when he goes off to do something, so I just expect him to do it when he's gone
<Presea> Lyon has been idle 16hrs 31mins, heh more then afk
<Shiny> Lol well like I said, it makes sense for what time it is
<Shiny> Meh, it's just a picture
<Lugianite> http://nonstopkarate.wordpress.com/2010/06/28/remembering-the-day-team-rocket-won/
<Lugianite> ...lol
<Shiny> Maybe now they'll let us be the villains in a Pokemon game |D
<Presea> wut
<Lugianite> lol
<Shiny> Also, after 4 seasons of battling, Ash still doesn't know that electric moves have no effect on ground types
<Kyro> XD
<Lugianite> what a n00b
<Shiny> I don't know why, but I saw Pokemon on and I decided to watch it
<Shiny> It was almost over, but I decided to watch the remainder of it
<Shiny> Ash, his friends, and their Pokemon had somehow been shrunk, so they were trying to find a way to return to normal
<Shiny> Well they cross paths with a wild Camerupt and it starts to charge at them
<Shiny> Ash decided to make Pikachu use thunderbolt on it
<Kyro> then raindance happens and stops the Camerupt from charging?
<Shiny> no
<Shiny> Ash was surprised that thunderbolt didn't work
<Presea> ._.
<Chimera> meow
<Chimera> :c
<Presea> well i suppose if you recall ash's battle with brock, thunderbolt took down an onix
<Presea> maybe he simply never learned
*Presea hides
<Chimera> Covered in water
<Chimera> ;P
<Presea> ;p
<Presea> but still
<Shiny> Again, after 4 seasons of battling, he still has no idea XD
<Chimera> I KNOW LOL
<Chimera> I mean
<Chimera> he uses Thunderbolt on EVERYTHING.
<Chimera> Even a swirling vortex of water *coughlatestmoviecough*
<Presea> haven't seen it
<Lugianite> well, Presea, it did not beat Onyx directly
<Presea> then again i haven't seen any of the newer movies
<Chimera> There's a part where a hole appears in the sky
<Lugianite> the showers did
<Presea> it beat a rydon directly
<Shiny> See, in the older seasons/episodes, he had a stupidity but most people let it off because he was either knew to the battle system
<Chimera> And it sucks up a bunch of water
<Presea> via it's horn
<Chimera> and piplup
<Shiny> Or the stupidity was funny (Aka: Him meaning stalker, but saying streaker)
<Chimera> Ash: PIKACHU USE THUNDERBOLT
<Chimera> Me: WTF?!
<Chimera> Ash also never gets past round 3 in the pokemon league lol
<Chimera> Yet he takes down Legends.
<Chimera> I find that hard to believe XD
<Shiny> He actually WON one of them?
<Presea> same
<Chimera> Shiny yes
<Shiny> Wait, that couldn't have been the original script
<Chimera> He always wins rounds one and two
<Chimera> Past that
<Chimera> OSH I LOST HOW WHY BAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWW
<Shiny> Because
<Shiny> YOU SUCK
<Chimera> Every frikkin time
<Shiny> And I stole your wallet
<Kipikipo> John McCain's ad compaigns are just... awful
<Chimera> Hence why I don't watch Pokemon anymore
<Chimera> >>
<Presea> well he's never "beaten" a legend he mostly runs, dies, or triggers a plot event
<Brother|CodeGeass> most are
<Absol> Presea hi
<Presea> hi
<Shiny> Yes, I'm the reason why Ash changes his Pokemon practically every season, because he doesn't have enough money to take them over to the next region
<Kipikipo> They seem so unprofessional though
<Chimera> XD
<Chimera> Yeah that's retarded
<Kipikipo> You remember the ads against Obama, right?
<Presea> infact when i saw the episodes of pokemon featuring not ash, but the ppl from gold/silver/crystal i honestly wished it'd keep going as i was tired of ash
<Shiny> I'm gonna start out with new Pokemon so that I can actually lose at the first gym herpderp
<Presea> :x
<Kipikipo> They did more damage to himself than to Obama...
<Brother|CodeGeass> Oh yes
<Shiny> lol Pokemon Chronicles
<Chimera> Haha Shiney
<Chimera> YES
<Brother|CodeGeass> But then dealing with american politics is something that can be double egded sword
<Chimera> Chronicles was decent
<Presea> ya
<Chimera> Compared to the show it was amazing
*Chimera runs
<Brother|CodeGeass> Take for example Alabama's govenor campaign
<Brother|CodeGeass> he tries to get the driver registration for only english
<Presea> ya
<Shiny> Compared to the manga it was nothing
<Shiny> Because you can actually kill Pokemon in the manga
<Shiny> |D
<Presea> also, i haven't watched the show in quite awhile, but i have a feeling team rocket is still in the show in every episode
<Brother|CodeGeass> But this will hurt him more because even though Alabama is one of the states that makes Confederates its govenors and governing body to openly accept racism is what its populance wont accept
<Shiny> They are
<Lugianite> I loved the manga
<Presea> they need a new job
<Lugianite> Red ftw
<Presea> never found a decent copy of the manga
<Brother|CodeGeass> they even made fun of it on Tosh.o
<Shiny> You can find it on OneManga.com
<Shiny> Or at least, that's how I read it
<Kipikipo> Now he's doing the same to his opponent in the running for Arizonan govenor and the ad is all over the place. It looks like it was cut and edited by a middle schooler because it litterally comprises of other commercials being cut and pasted together. XP
<Lugianite> hey Presea : I love the ones with Red, Blue and Yellow
<Presea> didn't see it on mangafox didn't try mangaone
<Brother|CodeGeass> Arizona has killed itself in any political ground
<Shiny> onemanga :U
<Brother|CodeGeass> with that law the conservatives really have killed themselves
<Presea> onemanga w/e
<Latiix> 2o.o
<Shiny> http://www.onemanga.com/Pokemon_Special/1/00/
<Kipikipo> I think it's gonna be overturned
<Brother|CodeGeass> though the liberals do nothing much
<Presea> does it show the pokedex talking to ash? ;p
<Brother|CodeGeass> It probably will
<Brother|CodeGeass> the FRSO has been fighting it, has as the USUP
<Presea> i loved how it made fun of him in the first few episodes
<Presea> i wonder why it stopped
<Brother|CodeGeass> Utah revoked
<Brother|CodeGeass> Minnasota, revoked
<Kyro> O.o
<Shiny> Because Dexter became upgraded
<Shiny> And wasn't as cool
<Kipikipo> There's dozens of other organizations threatening to pull funding and cancel vacations here
<Brother|CodeGeass> the laws support is going down thankfully
<Presea> they took out the AI, as it'd probably turn into skynet
*Presea hides
<Brother|CodeGeass> its a game with only 2 main players
<Kyro> (late) i dun never heard of Chronicals
<Brother|CodeGeass> with all the lapdogs each could have
<Brother|CodeGeass> hanity, oriely, Glenn Beck, etc
<Shiny> Then you FAIL
<Shiny> :U
<Presea> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Chronicles
<Kyro> i dont have cable or YT access, so thats why
<Brother|CodeGeass> I really wonder what's going to happen next
<Brother|CodeGeass> maybe, it'll be "Our" moment
<Brother|CodeGeass> or maybe just something we could use
<Presea> ah, well you missed out on a good series
<Shiny> so umm...
<Shiny> does anyone want to see my drawing?
<Presea> sure
<Shiny> kk, uploading soon
<Brother|CodeGeass> it really proves both canidates for presidency were not suitable, such as the rest of our presidents
<Kyro> lol Tracey Sketchit.... name fail
<Latiix> 2XD
<Shiny> Hmm, wonder what he does for a living
<Latiix> 2I think it'd be obvious lol
<Shiny> Yeah I know, it's sarcasm
<Kyro> XD
<Presea> ogod.. tracey
<Presea> he was just filler
<Presea> nothing more
<Shiny> I still remember his Marill of doom
<Kyro> exactly @ Pre
<Kyro> and his Scyther
<Presea> i liked his old scyther
<Kyro> yeah
<Presea> that's about it
<Shiny> Kyro and Presea are both wrong
<Presea> it had a back story
<Shiny> He wasn't even a filler
<Shiny> He was like...a filler character's long lost child
<Kyro> he was there to be stupid and fail
<Shiny> Who pretended to be like Prof. Oak when he was 10
<Kyro> XD
<Presea> he was in one of the movies, sitting in the backround doing nothing if i remember right
<Shiny> Pokemon 2000
<Presea> ya that's it
<Shiny> And in Pokemon 4ever's credits
<Shiny> At the VERY END of the credits
<Presea> lol
<Presea> trying to get in the movie it seems
<Kyro> lol the quote i remember most out of 2000..."more like the frozen one" and "I need pants"

<Brother|CodeGeass> :D
<Brother|CodeGeass> So, you've been evil? Good?
<Kipikipo> Online?
<Kipikipo> I've been just, but vengeful.
<Kipikipo> Whenever a posse is ganging up on a player, I ride in and wipe them out.
<Kipikipo> Whenever someone tries to take me out for no reason, I kill them repeatedly till they surrender or literally beg me to stop.
<Kipikipo> This past weekend, it was me and my friend against the world...
<Glacymr> 12o-o
*Glacymr surrenders to Kipikipo
<Kipikipo> A posse of 4 people attacked us on a plain
<Brother|CodeGeass> who betted the world would win?
<Kipikipo> We, of course, killed them multiple times
<Alek> I bet on the world to win the world cup over mars
<Glacymr> 12what are we talking about?
<Kipikipo> But soon other two-man posses joined the fray till it got to the point that it was literally us two versus 12 other people and the battle stretched out across a fort, over the plains, and to the cliffs
<Brother|CodeGeass> Kipi
<Brother|CodeGeass> do you have oblivion for the PC?
<Kipikipo> Online freeroam in Red Dead 2, Glacymr.
<Glacymr> 12oh
<Glacymr> 12i see
<Kipikipo> We killed the jerks who tried to shoot us at least 10 times each for every death we had
<Kipikipo> I sniped their facial region, and they'd call me names for being a sniper
<Kipikipo> I got on my horse 'n' charged at them, while shooting 'em up with a pistol so they started complaining that I had better weapons...
<Kipikipo> Then I just switched to the rifle, but they said I was sniping again, even though sniper rifles don't shoot that fast...
<Kipikipo> There was even a time I flanked this guy who was hiding behind cover and knifed him to death...
<Kipikipo> The words that followed...
<Kipikipo> they filled me with happiness. 3
<Glacymr> 12what a confusing game
<Alek> Warning: carnival rides are dangerous and can result in pants wetting, vomiting, and death.

<Andres> How is that a brighter note? :o
<Andres> Hi.
<Avani> hi's!
<Avani> and its a brighter note because I gets to see Jacob take his shirt off
<Andres> k.
<Andres> But would you not have to tolerate the rest of the stuff too?
<Avani> its a sacrifice
<Andres> Is it really worth it? :O
<Avani> yesh, Jacob is omg ripped
<Avani> it'd be easier to tolerate if the 'vampires' didn't make me mad so much
<Andres> They should be on fire!
<Andres> Fire makes everything better!
<Avani> in the first movie one of the 'vamps' catch on fire
<Andres> :o
<Avani> but all the vamps sparkle.. and that pisses me off

<Andres> It would be lulz if there was a standard non-sparkling vampire in the series killing the sparklers out of mercy.

<Creideiki> Good relative evening peoples.
<Creideiki> Hilariously... I just realized a torrent I'm downloading isn't pirated it's actually supposed to be torrented... The CBC has offically become epic in my opinion.
<Proto> This is the most important lesson you will ever learn
<Proto> If you're wearing the red uniform and you're on the team going to investigate the planet
<Aicebo> Stormy|Sleeping: i know your there
<Proto> You will not come back
<Stormy> just finished eating
<Proto> wb Stormy
<Aicebo> :P
<Stormy> thanks
<Aicebo> did you get a gmail message from SR last night
<Proto> You're welcome
<Stormy> I don't think so
<Stormy> why?
<Aicebo> coz at like 12 in the morning I randomly got a gmail chat message from him for some facebook thing, worded like an add
<Stormy> Was it likemypost.com?
<Aicebo> yes.
<Stormy> He's been talking about that in other channels for the past frew days
<Aicebo> still weird how he sent that o_O
<Aicebo> LAMBDA :D
<Proto> hey Lambda
<Lambda> hey
<Lambda> Hello
<Stormy> Hey
<Lambda> Heya Stormy
<Stormy> But yeah anyway, SR blocked me and I removed him from my contacts, so
<Stormy> Maybe he sent it out automatically to all his contacts or something
<Lambda> What happened?
<Aicebo> yeah coz I asked "what" and he said "I made a new site :)"
<Aicebo> then I just ignored him and went to bed
<Stormy> Aicebo got an advertisement
<Stormy> From SR
<Lambda> Hmm
<Lambda> An interesting turn of events
<Stormy> it's that likemypost thing he's been talking about in #staff for the past few days
<Lambda> ah
<Lambda> I guessed as much
<Stormy> What I don't get though is if it's a new site, how does it already have over 4000 facebook fans?
<Lambda> O.o
<Stormy> I mean, it's not like there aren't already 39872359 other facebook-like sites out there
<Aicebo> his add said "likemypost.com v2 is now live!"
<Aicebo> so I assume it's a new "version"
<Lambda> Maybe he helped with the new version
<Stormy> oh maybe
<Aicebo> bbl
<Lambda> I got an interview
<Lambda> :D
<Stormy> I removed him on Skype too
<Lambda> Oh, nice
<Stormy> :P
<Stormy> When's the interview?
<Lambda> tomorrow at 8:30
<Stormy> :D
<Lambda> ^_^
<Stormy> it's that fabric store, right?
<Lambda> Yep

<Lambda> :O
<Lambda> I was waiting for this trailer
<Lambda> now let's see how long it and Jenna's video take to load
<Stormy> maybe not as epic as that Mass Effect 2 trailer though eh? :P
<Lambda> I dunno
<Lambda> Harry Potter has the potential to be quite epic
<Lambda> But at the same time
<Lambda> that ME2 trailer was /really/ epic
<Stormy> loll
<Lambda> so it may be a tough contest
<Stormy> well
<Stormy> We'll find out
<Stormy> If you start having urges to watch it 15 more times
<Lambda> dun... dun... DUNNN!!!
<Lambda> XD

<Lambda> Holy.
<Aicebo> ARE YOU KIDDING ME STORMY YOUR [censored]ING 19 :'D
<Lambda> [censored].
<Lambda> her sister isn't though
<QuamtomAlpha> lambda you must rescue stormy from the nazi lair
<Stormy> Nor my brother
<Lambda> but yeah about that trailer...
<Stormy> Doesn't stop him from watching Family Guy at night though
<Lambda> Am I the only one with goosebumps?
<Lambda> Lol
<Stormy> no
<QuamtomAlpha> did they block toon disney as well
<Stormy> lol
<Stormy> Haha
<Stormy> I don't think we even get that channel
<Lambda> Howabout Animal Planet?
<Lambda> :P
<Stormy> But the reason they blocked it was because of Adult Swim at night
<QuamtomAlpha> ah
<QuamtomAlpha> some of the crap i can see being block for being offensive...
<Stormy> I don't care enough to ask them to unblock it'
<QuamtomAlpha> namely tim and eric
<Stormy> never seen that
<Lambda> The only show on Cartoon Network I watch is Pokemon
<Lambda> xP
<Aicebo> tim and eric looks like something people watch once they get themselves high on marijuana
<Lambda> and I rarely ever watch it
<QuamtomAlpha> 2 minutes at any sequence of that show is offensive to me
<Stormy> My dad banned me from watching Pokemon when I was 10 or 11
<QuamtomAlpha> lol?
<QuamtomAlpha> wtf
<Lambda> Poor Stormy
<Lambda> :(
<Aicebo> and weren't they gonna stop you from playing spyro or something too because of the "violence"
<Lambda> You lived a deprived childhood
<Stormy> Then about 5 years later I was watching it again
<Aicebo> even though you wouldn't ride on a [censored]ing dragon and slay the town
<QuamtomAlpha> dear lord does he go through your purse every time you go in and out of the door and make you walk through a metal detector?
<Lambda> O.o
<Lambda> That would be creepy
<Aicebo> AGES 4-11 = BELIEVING IN FANTASY TALES AND FOLLOWING YOUR DREAMS WHY DID YOUR PARENTS NOT SEE THIS
<QuamtomAlpha> i dont even know anyone that is remotely that strict
<Stormy> Dad: "What are you watchcing?" Me: "Pokemon" Dad: "Didn't I tell you you couldn't watch that?" Me: "That was when I was 10." Dad: *silence*
<QuamtomAlpha> ha
<Aicebo> it's like jesus christ you can't shelter your kids forever
<Lambda> "Stormy, I'm afraid I cannot allow you to enter the house until I search your purse" "But dad, it's raining" "Sorry, but rules are rules; surely you understand" **Stormy rages
<Stormy> :P
<Lambda> heh
<Aicebo> apparenly when I was 3 I saw clouded leopards humping
<Lambda> I argued with my mom about something like that today
<Aicebo> gosh
<Stormy> I don't think I was ever banned from Spyro for it being too violent though
<QuamtomAlpha> huh?
<Stormy> If anything the Playstation in general for playing it too much
<QuamtomAlpha> hah
<Lambda> I was banned from my ganecube a few times for that reason
<QuamtomAlpha> i was sorta lucky.... i played my stuff until i got tired of it
<Lambda> more like grounded I guess
<Aicebo> well what else is there to do in these times other than sit around and play videogames/watch tv and being banned from doing anything else
<Stormy> play outside
<Stormy> apparently
<Lambda> Very true Aicebo
<Lambda> lol, forgot about that
<Lambda> What;s there to do out there though?
<Lambda> :P
<Stormy> That was my parents' answer for everything
<Aicebo> stormy UNTIL THE KID BURGLAR COMES AND STEALS YOU IN PROMISES OF PUPPIES AND CANDY!!!!!!!
<QuamtomAlpha> half the time when i was a kid id hurt someone by playing outside
<Stormy> "GO PLAY OUTSIDE"
<Aicebo> :P
<Stormy> haha
<Lambda> QuantomAlpha: XD
<Aicebo> there were never any kids on my street when I was a little younger thus why I never played outside because I couldn't go anywhere without having to walk a distance
<Lambda> You were a bully then I take it?
<QuamtomAlpha> but mommy theres a weird guy outside... go outside and play! but mommie.... NOW!
<Lambda> same here
<QuamtomAlpha> nope
<Lambda> I only had one friend within walking distance
<QuamtomAlpha> i just had a nack for playing too rough
<Lambda> all the rest were from 30-45 minute drives away
<QuamtomAlpha> hell i was bullied when i was 10/11
<Aicebo> and when your that little you can't go walking around the neighborhood by yourself
<QuamtomAlpha> i use to go at the back of my block and meet up with kids that played pokemon and collected pokemon cards
<Lambda> I'm so jealous
<QuamtomAlpha> until one of them got the cops called on them for throwing rocks at another and then we broke up
<Lambda> I wish I had a group of kids that did that
<Aicebo> when I was a little younger I was madly in love with pokemon and hamtaro
<Lambda> it was just me and a couple friends that had Pokemon cards
<QuamtomAlpha> it wasnt all that speical
<QuamtomAlpha> lol hamtaro
<Lambda> "got the cops called on them for throwing rocks at another" Okay, maybe I'm not so jealous after all
<Lambda> :P
<QuamtomAlpha> lol
<QuamtomAlpha> i kneed one of them in the crotch for some reason as well but that was rough housing
<QuamtomAlpha> and for some reason i was nick named hojo out of nowhere
<Lambda> lol
<Lambda> strange nickname
<Hojo> i dunno if they were making fun of me for looking asian or what but i dont resemble japanese enough to be called a hojo
<Stormy> I loved Hamtaro
<Hojo> ham ham
<Stormy> Too bad it got canceled :(
<Aicebo> hamtaro is the [censored]ing [censored] I've been replaying my one game

<Stormy> Seamonkey?
<Stormy> lol
<Corevette789> Yup
<Corevette789> It was discontinued I beleive
<Corevette789> OH, and Mozilla Sueite
<Proto> Hmm
<Corevette789> Suite*
<Stormy> http://www.mozilla.org/projects/browsers.html
<Stormy> Looks like it's still listed
<drfsupercenter> 03Um
<drfsupercenter> 03sortra
<drfsupercenter> 03*sorta
<drfsupercenter> 03it's hosted on OVH
<Glacymr> 12OVH?
<drfsupercenter> 03it's just a bot I have access to
<drfsupercenter> 03OVH.
<drfsupercenter> 03The place I was telling Articuno to host TST on
<drfsupercenter> 03it's a webhost
<drfsupercenter> 03a channel I work for has a server there
<drfsupercenter> 03and I have an account
<drfsupercenter> 03so I just use IRC from it
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Glacymr> 12how can you host an IRC bot
<Glacymr> 12on a webhost
<Lambda> I'm gonna watch a movie with my sister
<Lambda> be back in a bit
<InfamousZed> k
<Stormy> no!
<drfsupercenter> 03it's a *server*
<drfsupercenter> 03it runs Linux
<InfamousZed> stormy has spoken
<Corevette789> Hmm called it :)
<Lambda|Movie> :O
<drfsupercenter> 03you can use IRC on Linux
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Glacymr> 12usually when people say webhost
*Stormy glues Lambda|Movie to his computer
<Lambda|Movie> don't worry
<Glacymr> 12i figure they mean it hosts websites
<Lambda|Movie> I will return
<Stormy> you'd better!
<Lambda|Movie> I will!
<Lambda|Movie> :P
<Proto> I hate people that are arrogant and act like because you made a mistake you're an idiot. And if people take advice about chemicals like /lye/ from the internet, they're morons.
<Proto> If they're messing with lye, they know what they're doing
<InfamousZed> lambda's mom will get on and start posing as him to figure out his dirty secrets on these online chat rooms
<Proto> </angry rant>
<InfamousZed> i'm supprised that your parents dont try any of that stormy
<Stormy> They've logged into my email account before
<InfamousZed> ha
<Stormy> SR once sent me a message when my mom was on my account
*Corevette789 gasp
<drfsupercenter> 03it does
*drfsupercenter runs
<InfamousZed> ha she think he was some 40 year old stalker?
<drfsupercenter> 03here's the difference
<Stormy> So for conversations after that where I didn't answer right away he'd be like, "hello?? Mrs. Wagner?"
<drfsupercenter> 03cheap webhosts run Linux, but they only give youa ccess to FTP
<drfsupercenter> 03this runs Linux and we can actually use it like a computer
<drfsupercenter> 03we can still host websites
<drfsupercenter> 03but also run programs
<drfsupercenter> 03etc
<Stormy> Yeah actaully
<Stormy> that's the reason she was on my email
<Stormy> to read his messages
<Corevette789> Chrome uses Mozilla NSS and NPAPI Libraries
<Stormy> at least she didn't pretend to be me though, haha
<Glacymr> 12i see
<InfamousZed> i did that on my brother's computer though
<Stormy> o.o
<Stormy> why?
<Glacymr> 12so if you want to host a program that can't run on linux
<InfamousZed> course i couldnt pull my brother's personality off
<Corevette789> Chrome according to this is a Mozilla project
<Proto> I may be getting an Evo, Corevette789
<InfamousZed> snooping after i got my pics off of his computer
<Corevette789> They look nice, maybe too big
<Stormy> lol
<Stormy> did he find out?
<Proto> Yeah
<Proto> I usually carry my phone in my pocket
<InfamousZed> essentially the computer was my dad's but my brother started using it non stop and it became his
<Proto> with keys and pens and pointy stuff D:
<InfamousZed> i dont know if he did or not
<InfamousZed> but i found a pic of him and annother girl on there
<Stormy> hm
<InfamousZed> and i'm like ho ho ho..... tres bien!
<Corevette789> I just about broke this Rumor 2 already
<Proto> heh
<InfamousZed> except now that i tihnk of it... the girl looks fairly similar to aicebo....
<Aicebo> ?
<Corevette789> Ran it over with a Snowmobile then it froze shut and a few months later ran it over with a lawnmower
<InfamousZed> and i'm dead serious on that point
<drfsupercenter> 03then you're out of luck.
<Aicebo> anthony green shirt and hatsy in all?
<drfsupercenter> 03The bot uses irssi
<drfsupercenter> 03which is a command line IRC client
<Corevette789> It fell out of my pocket on the Snowmobile
<Glacymr> 12lol
<drfsupercenter> 03which is why it takes me so fricking long to fix it if YOU GUYS kill the thing
<drfsupercenter> 03>_>
<drfsupercenter> 03as I have to manually reconnect, it's not auto
<InfamousZed> no, just the hoody i always see you in
<Proto> I've never even seen snow
<InfamousZed> brb i'm gona find that pic

<Glacymr> 12he'll just hire people to find the answer for him

<TimeShift> the server's already moved in fact. But the url is still pointing to the wrong server

<TimeShift> the new server will be at 88.84.143.164
<TimeShift> yet the url points at 95.215.225.1 atm
<drf|work> gives me one of those "You ahven't made your site yet" things
<TimeShift> because you're not coming with the right url referer
<TimeShift> there're four urls runninig on this IP atm - the only thing splitting them is the url
<TimeShift> it's quite intended to deliver a different page to the people just asking for an IP
<TimeShift> as those are usually the poorest of the poor hackers :P
<TimeShift> that's the basic domain security ;)
<drf|work> O...K

<Lugia365> 12hello

<Prince-dari> Oh, you English?
<Sparky> 2nope o3o'''
<May> owo
<Lugia365> 12Ovo
<Betowolf> hihi
<May> I have to trade it to my Platinum game, gah
<Sparky> 2I'm born and raised on the West Coast, but for some reason a lot of my vocabulary, spelling, and pronounciation is Canadian and English ouo
<Sparky> 2*pronunciation 
<Lugia365> 12the U.S.?
<Sparky> 2yeah
<Sparky> 2oh and I say "Sco'ish"
<Lugia365> 12I live in the west coast lol
<Sparky> 2o3o
<Sparky> 2....
<Lugia365> 12?
<Sparky> 2wait lemme check what direction this is...
<Sparky> 2yeah west
<Prince-dari> Oh, so am I right in thinking that generally in America people say it with "ay", or is that completely wrong?
<Sparky> 2mm no
<Sparky> 2but mis-chee-vee-ous is o3o
<Sparky> 2for mischievous 
<Lugia365> 12lol
<Sparky> 2"mis-chih-vuss"
<Sparky> 2it's not wrong
<Sparky> 2it's just Amercan English
<Sparky> 2same with herb and herb
<Sparky> 2because there is an "h" in it o3o
<Lugia365> 12lol
<Prince-dari> Sometimes I get confused in writing when people say "an herb", because when I read it in my head it sounds completely ridiculous. XD
<Sparky> 2XD
<Prince-dari> And other pronunciation related things like that.
<Lugia365> 12you know I never got what the phrase "
<Sparky> 2when there's an an in front of it, I think "erb"
<Lugia365> 12oops
<Lugia365> 12derp ment*
<Sparky> 2but then usually it's "herb"
<Prince-dari> I never hear people say it 'erb, so I'm not used to it. XD
<Sparky> 2XD until fifth grade I said "herb," then everyone kept correcting me, so I kept saying "erb" for a few years
*Lugia365 yawns
<Aristeo> D:
*Aristeo called him
<Sparky> 2except I started saying "herb" again last year 'cause it made more sense XP
<Sparky> 2like... "mayonnaise"
<Sparky> 2everyone says "may-naze"
<Sparky> 2so I sit there thinking "whut?"
<Prince-dari> O_o
<Sparky> 2XD they like, remove the o
<Sparky> 2and I 2say2 the o, but really fast so they sound the same to me, but everyone keeps telling me there's no oh sound
<Sparky> 2which confuses me
<Sparky> 2there ARE 3 syllables in that word, right?
<Sparky> 2*checks dictionary* yeah 3
<Sparky> 2almost typo'd that as "yeah o3o"
<Sparky> 2XD
<Prince-dari> The second one is hard to tell when you say it quickly.
<Lugia365> 12every word that sounds weard, they are part of the english language. Take the word "pnamonia" for example (I think that's how you spell it :P)
<Lugia365> 12...
<Sparky> 2XD
<Lugia365> 12what?
<Prince-dari> I think my pet hate with pronunciation has to be "aitch", as "haitch".
<Sparky> 2lol
<Sparky> 2h?
<Lugia365> 12???
<Prince-dari> Yep.
<Sparky> 2XD
<Sparky> 2somehow I think that "haitch" would be harder to say
<Prince-dari> What really gets at me is when the ENGLISH teachers pronounce it incorrectly.
<Lugia365> 12lol
<Lugia365> 12everyone makes mistakes

<Stormy> o_O
<Stormy> how could he still be alive?
<LaptopAristeo> Oh, it's just a big misunderstanding, I stole the body
<Andres> Child molesting magic!

<LaptopAristeo> Yep
<Corevette789> Is there anything you need to do to view a anamation without the accompinaing disk
<LaptopAristeo> In order to torrent something, you need something that lets you torrent
<Andres> Like a diplomatic immunity?

<Andres> Hello :o
<TimeShift> lol, I told you about our dumb system to paypawn for glass and plastic bottles and drink tins, right?
<TimeShift> I just got dinner - with a tin of cola with the menu. To bypass this pawn laws in germany, they imported the tin from poland to sell it here :P
<Kyu> 07?
<TimeShift> if you go and buy a Red Bull, you pay the price for the drink, right?
<Kyu> 07ya
<drf|work> EW RED BULL
<TimeShift> or Coke, water - whatever
<drf|work> k
<TimeShift> well, here you don't just pay for the drink, but you also need to pay a pawn for the bottle/tin
<Kyu> 07oh
<Kyu> 07that
<Kyu> 07we've had that for years lol
<TimeShift> 15 cents for a glass bottle and 25 cents for a plastic bottle or a tin
<TimeShift> even if those bottles or tins are disposed afterwards?
<Kyu> 07you get your money back when you recycle it
<TimeShift> yeah
<drf|work> yeah, we've had that forever
<drf|work> Michigan is the highest in the country inf act
<drf|work> at 10 cents
<drf|work> everywhere else it's 5
<TimeShift> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wK2fhg0Qil0
<TimeShift> that's how the machines look like here
<TimeShift> and the prices vary depending on what you have
<Kyu> 07o3o
<Kyu> 07we don't have those here lol
<TimeShift> glass beer bottles: between 8 to 15 cents. Plastic bottles 25 cents if they're disposable, 15 cents if they're re-usable

<Articuno> 12Ahh
*TimeShift sets mode 5+fail drf|work
<Articuno> 12Yeh that makes him look different
<drf|work> grr stupid software
<drf|work> this thing is called SysAid

<Articuno> 12brbrb
<TimeShift> I'm kinda glad we have so few problems with the maintenance right now
<Sparky> 2hullo
<TimeShift> as yes, I'm in command right now since 4pm and will be at service for another around 4 hours I guess
<Articuno> 12:/
<drf|work> hm
<drf|work> no wonder
<TimeShift> we had only two problems til now
<drf|work> remote desktop'ing to my own computer doesn't work
<drf|work> XD
<drf|work> but I can't get it to work on any OTHER oen either...
<drf|work> *one
<drf|work> they're all LAN
<TimeShift> one machine didn't like a kernel patch and had to be reverted to another state...and the network crew messed up the database connection for a major server rack
<TimeShift> the biggest pile of maintenance will be done tomorrow: We're updating the SAN systems on one of our datacenters. We hope nothing goes wrong there....
<drf|work> hi
<Black_Latios> 02heya, I woke up late XD
<Articuno> 12Hi Black_Latios ^v^
<drf|work> LOL
<drf|work> I wish I could sleep in :(
<drf|work> Stupid being at work at 8AM
<Black_Latios> 02heya Arti! :D
<drf|work> and I can't even sneak out of work early today
<Articuno> 12I wish I got IRC at work! XD
<drf|work> as I have no car here ATM LOL
<drf|work> we're getting it repaired
<drf|work> I got a ride here :/
<TimeShift> though the guys told us we were about 99.99% safe, the last remaining 0.01% would be....well....a catastrophe
<Articuno> 12ovo
<drf|work> LOL Arti
<drf|work> it's really weird too
<drf|work> the filters here block sites like verydemotivational.com too
<drf|work> but not Facebook or IRC
<Black_Latios> 02I gotta wake up at 7am tomorrow, me and Danny are leaving for PA at 9 :o
<Articuno> 12XD
<drf|work> PA?
<TimeShift> if something goes wrong, we lose one of the SAN systems. Each of them around 28 terabytes of data
<Articuno> 12Does it block draelen.co.uk? LOL
<Black_Latios> 02yes, Pennsylvania :3
<TimeShift> a full restore would take us...well....around a week
<drf|work> Nope.
<drf|work> :O
<Articuno> 12Wow thats a lot of data >v<
<drf|work> PA isn't too far from me
<Black_Latios> 02really? :o
<drf|work> Arti, the filter here isn't NEARLY as insane as school
<drf|work> Yeah
<drf|work> well it's like 5-6 hours
<drf|work> but still
<drf|work> XD
<drf|work> closer than NY
<Black_Latios> 02we're gonna be in Nazareth :o
<Black_Latios> 02LOL
<drf|work> >_>
<drf|work> closer than NY <-
*drf|work sings in his head
<TimeShift> remember Arti: 28 TB * 5 SAN systems * 4 datacenters. Now you get an idea HOW much data^^
<drf|work> o/` that's just the way it is, some things will never change o/1
<Black_Latios> 02OMFG
<drf|work> I've literally been looping this for 2-3 days
<Black_Latios> 02I never thought that spicy brown mustard would taste soo good on a ham sammich :o
<Articuno> 12I always put mustard on a ham sandwich XD
<drf|work> EW MUSTARD
<drf|work> what's awesome is BMTs.
<drf|work> At Subway
<drf|work> ham, pepperoni, salami, and cheese
<drf|work> and I eat them plain, no veggies XD
<Articuno> 12I used to hate mustard until Xai made me try a bit recently
<drf|work> eh
<drf|work> it's not as bad as mayo but I still don't care for it
<Articuno> 12Ew mayo
<drf|work> plus
<drf|work> it's empty calories
<drf|work> why not just eat it plain?
<Black_Latios> 02my mom had me try it since there was no mayo D:<

<Black_Latios> 02which I now a plan to do when I leave, since Danny will hopefully bring his laptop :o
<drf|work> XD
<drf|work> I wonder if his laptop is as awesome as mine
*drf|work runs
<drf|work> since he's a nerd and whatnot
<Black_Latios> 02he has his crappier one here with him in NY
<drf|work> XD
<Black_Latios> 02he has 2 laptops :o
<drf|work> my laptop was like $2000
<drf|work> but it's awesome
<drf|work> better than most desktops
<drf|work> and it was all graduation money anyway :)
<drf|work> and LOL, cool
<drf|work> I have two desktops really
<drf|work> the old one and the new one I just built
<drf|work> but the old one's just sitting in my basement
<Black_Latios> 02I wish I had a laptop
<drf|work> yeah
<drf|work> I wanted one all through high school
<drf|work> and finally bought one after I graduated XD
<Black_Latios> 02I wanted to do computer tech for college, but since mom doesn't approve of that, I chose nursing
<drf|work> that's ... a big difference
<Black_Latios> 02I know, and it scares me
<drf|work> XD
<drf|work> my parents were totally supportive of me doing engineering
<drf|work> or w/e
<drf|work> I don't even know yet
<drf|work> I'm just in "engineering"
<drf|work> I'm supposed to pick a specific field but :/
<Black_Latios> 02I absolutely hate needles >_<
<drf|work> oh
<drf|work> I actually don't mind them
<drf|work> except the other day
<drf|work> they had to draw blood and fricking stabbed me in the hand
<drf|work> it still hurts a little
<drf|work> brb
<Aeroslash> BL, aren't you an adult now? My must your mom choose your career path for you?
<Aeroslash> *Why
<Black_Latios> 02better money, and yes i'll be 19 in 5 days
<Aeroslash> Well, is money everything to you?
<Aeroslash> no offense
<Black_Latios> 02but the choice of nursing also follows something i've been wanting to do for a while, and that it taking care of babies :o
<Black_Latios> 02no, not really
<Aeroslash> because it's gonna be hard to be a nurse if you can't even give people shots because you hate needles
<Aeroslash> well, Nursing is a lot more than nusring infants
<Aeroslash> *nursing
<drf|work> back
<Black_Latios> 02I need to conquer my fears eventually
<Aeroslash> it's more or less taking care of ill paitents
<drf|work> LOL
<Aeroslash> true
<drf|work> watch Scrubs if you want an idea :P
<Aeroslash> but if you cannot in time, then what?
<drf|work> that show is awesome
<Black_Latios> 02I like that show XD
<drf|work> yeah
<Black_Latios> 02but I watch Grey's Anatomy more
<drf|work> EW
<drf|work> I hate girly shows ><
<drf|work> OMFG
<Aeroslash> I might as well be a person who studies spiders for a living then.... since I'm afraid of them
<Black_Latios> 02well, i'm a girl and it makes more sense XD
<drf|work> I'm making a mess of this soda
<drf|work> and I don't have any napkins
<Aeroslash> I'm a girl and I hate Grey's Anatomy
<drf|work> wow
<Aeroslash> lol why did I think of napkins as something else? XD
<Black_Latios> 02mehh, we all think differently of it
<drf|work> my co-workers are talking about drinking
<drf|work> I hate when they do that
<Aeroslash> I suppose so @ BL
<drf|work> XD
<Aeroslash> and yeah, I don't like the subject of alchol either DRF
<drf|work> I just made my co-workers laugh
<drf|work> they asked me if I drink
<drf|work> and I was like
<Aeroslash> orly?
<drf|work> "No, I'm one of very few actually CLEAN college students"
<drf|work> and for some reason they started laughing
<Black_Latios> 02one big step in conquering my fear will be on the 10th, when I get my first tattoo :o
<Aeroslash> =/
<drf|work> heh
<Aeroslash> and what you getting a tatoo of, BL?
<drf|work> I'm surprised your parents are letting you get one
<drf|work> I kinda think tattoos are stupid anyway

<Lugia365> 12yes they do drf
<TimeShift> take it another way Xai: Jealousy is the highest form of honoring someone
<drf|work> LOL
<Articuno> 12Yeh it does, never thought of that because I don't use DA anymore so it's not a huge problem
<Lugia365> 12ya
<drf|work> I don't use it either XD
<Articuno> 12Buuuuut when I saw that he asked me a question on my formspring, I replied XD
<drf|work> thanks to Facebook
<Lugia365> 12does he have a TST account?
<Articuno> 12No thankfully
<Lugia365> 12okay
<TimeShift> yet don't worry about him. Few of those patriotic guys have the guts to seriously cause any harm
<Xai> 05timeshift - it dosen't take away the creepy of really old guy being jelous of young girl's mate
<TimeShift> true
<Articuno> 12When he doesn't even know me
<TimeShift> but well, he's not "old"
<Articuno> 12and has never spoken to me
<drf|work> LOL
<drf|work> I wonder if he's seen photos of you
<Xai> 05are you seriously defending disturbing older men chasing after young girls on the internet?
*drf|work hides
<TimeShift> that piece of american junk is 8 years younger than me
<Articuno> 12He LOOKS old XD we think he's like pretending to be 20
<TimeShift> born feb 29 1988
<Lugia365> 12I agree then lol
<Articuno> 12Yeh I don't believe that after seeing his photo
<Xai> 05i didn't realise you lost all your hair at the age of 20, timeshifts
<Lugia365> 12LOL
<Xai> 05no fn way
<Xai> 05that is a lie
<Lugia365> 12I'm looking at his photo right now
<Xai> 05no-one that bald is 22
<Articuno> 12Let me show the picture again XD http://americanho-oh.deviantart.com/#/d2sou04
<Lugia365> 12he's almost bald
<TimeShift> my father had lost most of his hair when he was about 19
<TimeShift> I have photos right next to me. So well, it IS possible
<Xai> 05he looks like 38
<Articuno> 12Even his face looks old
<TimeShift> nah - no
<Lugia365> 12more like 40
<Articuno> 12LOLZ
<Lugia365> 12my dad is 48 and he still has all his hair
<Lugia365> 12or 46
<Lugia365> 12I can't remember
<Xai> 05he looks like a guy called 'steve' that works as a security guard for a shipping company somewhere in the middle USA
<TimeShift> look at the forehead. It's perfectly flat. Not a single wrinkle in it
<Articuno> 12My mum doesn't have wrinkles and she's over 50 :3
<Lugia365> 12lol
<Andrew> one of my work mates is 23 but he looks 40
<Articuno> 12Considering the guy hates All alcoholic beverages (as his profile says)..
<Lugia365> 12it depends on who the person is
<TimeShift> I just looked at the picture with him smiling. Someone of around 30 has those if he's smiling. I know it because I have those, too
<Andrew> that guy deffo looks 30
<Articuno> 12Has what?
<TimeShift> and I have quite a good talent in telling the age of people I see^^
<Articuno> 12He's certainly not 22 XD
<Articuno> 12He made up the age to try and talk to me XD
<Lugia365> 12ya XD
<Lugia365> 12LOL
<Lugia365> 12now that is creepy LOL
<Andrew> people lying about themselves on the internet: non-shocker! XD
<Articuno> 12:3
<Lugia365> 12I don't lie about my age thank goodness LOL
<Lugia365> 12I'm 17
<Articuno> 12Andrew I take it you saw the Xai pic last time right?
<Bloatedfish> this steam sale has came at a good time
<TimeShift> anyways. The guy does not know where you live and even if he did I doubt he would be able to find england on a map
<Andrew> by the way i'm really a samurai ninja dude
<Articuno> 12XD
<Andrew> which pic?
<Articuno> 12LOL I'm not worried about that TimeShift
<Articuno> 12The one he drew of Xai
<Andrew> oh ya
<Articuno> 12Loooool
<TimeShift> not calming you, I'm trying to calm Xai and tell him not to worry
<Andrew> that guy seems creepy anyway
<Lugia365> 12it just makes me a little mad when people like him do this kind of stuff >.>
<Curly> ugh at people who just get all sarcastic at people who misunderstood instead of explaining _-_
<Xai> 05well the very fact he is lying about his age makes me even more suspicious.
<Lugia365> 12ya
<Aristeo> D:
<Lugia365> 12sounds like some kind of stalker
<Curly> no, that had nothing to do with anyone here
*Curly came here just because nobody here was involved >.>
<TimeShift> as I said: I really believe his age. He doesn't look like a 30 years old guy. Trust me with that
*Andres tacklehugs a Curly.
*Curly hugs back
<Xai> 05i mean why can't he just leave her alone - she has never ever even messaged him and he is asking questions like "I'm worried about you, you don't come on DA anymore"
<Lugia365> 12I kind of agree with that :/
<TimeShift> btw. a 30 year old turkey-bird-fan? Oh come on^^
<drf|work> because people are weird?
<drf|work> XD
<Lugia365> 12lol
<Articuno> 12What about a 30 year old giant white fish fan? *runs*
<Xai> 05a 30-year old who picked ho-oh to sound like a pokemon fan? yes.
<Lugia365> 12everyone is different
<TimeShift> maybe the same reason why I worry about some others? Because Arti's art is - regardless what she says - amazing?
*TimeShift slaps Arti with a Schwertfisch
*Proto sits indifferently in the corner
<Articuno> 12Yeh but you're my friend TimeShift, you speak to me. He's never once spoken to me
<Articuno> 12Lol
<Lugia365> 12I know someone who's banned on dA that said he was 21 and likes tomas the train or what ever lol
<Xai> 05so you would track someone down who is inactive on da and send them creepy messages like that?
<Xai> 05just because they had done good art?
<Aristeo> :)
<Lugia365> 12sounds creepy when you think about it :/
*Curly huggles Proto in the corner of indifference
*Proto hugs
*Aristeo is glad that this place serves as a good retreat from drama :3
<Black_Latios> 02D:
<TimeShift> I would just ask this person why he/she disappeared (in fact, gender is irrelevant at that point :P ), yeah. It's not a big deal to ask at least
<Articuno> 12Thats not the only creepy thing though, the fact that he also drew a pic of Xai getting beaten up by a washing machine and then said he was JEALOUS Ovo
<Lugia365> 12idk if what he's doing is reportable on dA?
<TimeShift> if this person tells me to leave her alone, I go, yeah
<Articuno> 12Yeh but "I'm worried about you"
<Articuno> 12Why is he worried when he can see I'm active on TST?
<Xai> 05no, you didn't answer my question - you would track them down to a different website and register just so that you could ask them why they went off da?
<TimeShift> maybe he didn't join TST?
<Lugia365> 12I replied to one of his comments on your dA profile arti and said that you weren't active on there anymore...
<TimeShift> 2(Xai2): No, I'm not SUCH a kind of stalker^^
<Xai> 05thank you.
<Articuno> 12He hasn't joined, but he got on, went through the whole site then went to ask me a question on my Ask Articuno page
<Lugia365> 12but he didn't reply back
<Articuno> 12Where he could see that my last answred questions were recent
<Articuno> 12I'm actually SURPRISED he's not joined LOL XD
<TimeShift> did you know I saw this "ask Articuno"-page for the first time in my life today?^^
<Lugia365> 12LOL
<TimeShift> maybe he tried but I deleted him already?^^
<Articuno> 12Lol
<Articuno> 12LOL
<Articuno> 12Do you remember the name American Ho-oh?
<TimeShift> only from the original picture link you posted some time ago
<Articuno> 12Ok, I havent seen him try to draw yet XD
<Lugia365> 12I'll brb

<Aurora> 6possibly tonight
<Aurora> 6I might be busy tomorrow
<Brother|Stuff> XD, it' be hilarious if you put them in a katyusha
<Brother|Stuff> and let them fly
<Aurora> 6I've only got two and a half hours until the contest drawings
<Aurora> 6crossing my fingers here
<Brother|Stuff> XD, to get that truck right?
<Brother|Stuff> and make it the superspecialawsome truck?
<TimeShift> truck?
<drf-Droid> what starts with F and ends with uck? Fire truck!
*drf-Droid runs
<TimeShift> !define rtfm

<drf-Droid> ...
<Aurora> 6I really dont care about the truck
<drf-Droid> I can't fix that from here -_-
<TimeShift> ^^
<Aurora> 6I mean, if I win it, then heck yes lets party
<Aurora> 6But still
<Brother|Stuff> so then what do you care about winning?
<TimeShift> the honor
<Aurora> 6the $700 block party firework box
<Aurora> 6because I actually have a decent chance at it lol
<TimeShift> you americans and your fireworks....
<Aurora> 6indeed <3
<Brother|Stuff> XD
<Kipikipo> !lag
<Brother|Stuff> Fireworks would be awsome with a Katyusha, and a interesting change
<Brother|Stuff> only because it doesnt just go straigh up
<TimeShift> I like those big fireworks, but just don't like those stuff just making *boom*
<Brother|Stuff> fireworks reminds me of the chinese characters for firechicken..(AKA the Turkey)
<TimeShift> you mean this thing others call Ho-oh?
<Brother|Stuff> No
<Brother|Stuff> In chinese mandarin the literal translation of the characters are fire
<Brother|Stuff> and chicken
<Aurora> 6TimeShift, most of our fireworks are pretty quiet
<Aurora> 6but they make fabulous colors
<Aurora> 6Purple Rains <3
<Brother|Stuff> besides, july 4th is the day for corporations all over the US to try and sell as much as possible
<Aurora> 6 4th of july is a day I hang out with friends, play around during the day, have an awesome barbeque lunch/dinner, and then party with fireworks all night
<TimeShift> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP4CEeYgYxU&feature=related
<TimeShift> THAT's fireworks :)
<Aurora> 6indeed, but those are illegal buys out here

<Aeroslash> O.o
<Kipikipo> You woulf
<Kipikipo> wolf*
<Aeroslash> why do you love Disney all of a sudden, Brother? O.O;;;;
<Brother|Stuff> I dont
<Brother|Stuff> I just watch old disney movies to remind myself
<Brother|Stuff> some of their work isnt bad
<Brother|Stuff> and others just are horrible like hollywood
<Aeroslash> XD excuses excuses
<Aristeo> D:
<drf-Droid> old Disney is good XD
<Brother|Stuff> besides, I dont want to watch a movie that gets to the point right now XD
<Brother|Stuff> blah
<Brother|Stuff> only parts of it drf
<Aeroslash> and you like the color red not because it was the Soviet Union's flag :P
<Brother|Stuff> Nah
*NightHawk hoses Aristeo
<Brother|Stuff> different reasons :P
<Aeroslash> riiiighhhtt
<Aeroslash> XD
<Brother|Stuff> besidesm why do you say that when I'm listening to the victory song XD
<Aeroslash> because I can? :P
<Brother|Stuff> oh yah before I extrmely forget
<Brother|Stuff> Aurora did you see that new Avatar movie?
<Aurora> 6not yet
<Aurora> 6I almost did though
<Aeroslash> It looks dumb =/
<Aurora> 6I loved the series
<Aeroslash> why make a real life movie off a cartoon?
*Andres drops a fireball on everyone!
<Aurora> 6the movie probably is gonna absolutely slaughter it
<Aeroslash> the series was meh
<Brother|Stuff> aurora: yeah
<Brother|Stuff> it will
<Aurora> 6although props to them for making some of the scenes IDENTICAL to the show
<Brother|Stuff> I saw it 'kinda'
<Aurora> 6that never happens
<Brother|Stuff> Well ironic
<Aeroslash> and same with my loving the Guardians of Ga'hoole series, the movie will ruin what little love it has
<Brother|Stuff> they found Aaang (now called Aoong) on the internets
<Brother|Stuff> but hopefully it wont fail like Karate Kid did
<Brother|Stuff> or Kung Fu kid..whatever it is legitmately
<Aeroslash> it most likely will =/
*Aeroslash sighes
<drf-Droid> LOL, Karate Kid already has a bootleg DVD link
<drf-Droid> er
<Aristeo> :o
<drf-Droid> -link o.o
<Aurora> 6lol
<NightHawk> lol
<Brother|Stuff> drf: thats only because the kid is the son of a famous guy :P
<drf-Droid> LOL
<Brother|Stuff> seriously, that family is going to get richer
<drf-Droid> but I mean

<TimeShift> neither did you Creideiki - except you've lived and worked at it in 1969 already
<WetBunnyfox> ;~;
<WetBunnyfox> okies
<Phoenix> 2_
<Phoenix> 2lol alt codes
<TimeShift> but I worked with hole cards - the prior-art of those diskettes :P
<Brother|CzterejPancerniiPies> arg..
<Brother|CzterejPancerniiPies> I hate it when the guy hanges it from Pies to Pies Zaoga
<Creideiki> TimeShift: I may have been born in 1991... but I do get to work with retrocomputers. My VT-103 (PDP-11/23 crammed into a VT-100 terminal) has a nice third party diskette/hard disk drive. Removeable pack hard disks and 8" floppies for the win.
<Creideiki> Also, I have sort of used punch cards (mostly punching and testing a reader for a PDP-12... don't ask).
<TimeShift> see, you use those out of nostalgy, I know and used them because there was nothing but it
<Creideiki> Well... my first "personal" computer actually was "retro"... yay for a surplused IBM System/32... which was interesting.
<TimeShift> bet you don't know any schellack LPs anymore - and if you see such a thing you have no idea why there're speeds like 15, 33, 45 or 72 on it, right?
<Creideiki> I don't have shellac LPs, but I do have a small library of vinyl (sounds nicer).
<Creideiki> Speed wise, I though the speeds were 16-<fraction>, 33-1/3, 35 and 78.
<Creideiki> (I don't remember the speed of the slowest one perfectly, but I do know they were used for radio transcription.)
<TimeShift> anyways - I'm in bed now
<TimeShift> almost two hours after midnight and I wanna fetch some sleep
<Andrew> hi guys
<Phoenix> 2hi
<Creideiki> Hehe, well g'night to ye then TimeShift.
<Andrew> the TST meet has been awesome today :)
<TimeShift> ...
<TimeShift> wished I had been there, too
<Brother|CzterejPancerniiPies> ohai andrew
<TimeShift> well, I'll get another chance to meet all of you
<Phoenix> 2_
<Creideiki> Oh hey, I just realized... my System/380 mini-project has finished installing MVS/380. Woot, time for first IPL.
<Phoenix> 2
<Andrew> busy with work i take it, TimeShift?
<Phoenix> 2omai
<Phoenix> 2
<Andrew> the BBQ and webcam will be on tomorrow, so you can pretend you're there at least XD
<TimeShift> this weekend is/was our maintenance window for our datacenter systems. And we had to upgrade our storage system of one datacenter - therefore shutting down all servers running there
<Andrew> oh right
<Creideiki> TimeShift: Oww... the clinets must have been unpleased, to say the least.
<Drake> 04morning
<TimeShift> that's why we have maintenance weekends. One in every month. Some of them are shorter, others longer
<Brother|CzterejPancerniiPies> wb lyon
<Lyon> 04ty
<TimeShift> but if we don't perform the maintenance, the systems will just fail
<Creideiki> Well... preventative maintenance is always a good idea.
<TimeShift> sure, but patches need to be installed. And an installed patch requires a server to be rebooted. Something that can't be done in the productive time
<Brother|CzterejPancerniiPies> npl
<TimeShift> and storage controllers need new firmware so we can extend each rack over 28 terabytes of disk space
<TimeShift> backup systems need to be updated to faster and more performant one's
<Creideiki> What is the backup media that you use any way?
<Brother|CzterejPancerniiPies> whats up lyon
<TimeShift> we mirror on two other SAN sytems in different locations and have tape robots
<Lyon> 04the roof
<TimeShift> but a full restore of a datacenter would take around...well....a week
<TimeShift> or two
<Creideiki> Well... that sounds rather average in time length.
<TimeShift> depends on how critical the data is
<Creideiki> Tell me, you ever work on real big iron?
<Creideiki> (Best I've done is as an unpaid weekend "operator" (i.e. "Just watch the system so if it crashes you can call someone.") guy for an aging ESA/390 based box - it crashed twice.)
<Aristeo> Hi Stitch!
*Aristeo shoots Stitch
*Stitch shoots ari first
<Proto> Hey Stitch
<Proto> Gentlemen, take it to a duel >.>
<TimeShift> erm....dunno what you'd call "real big iron", but we have around 32 racks filled with 72 quad-core-processors. And that's just the recent AIX farm we've built up
<Creideiki> "Big Iron" being the nickname for a mainframe-class system.
<TimeShift> as I said - we have about 32 of those newly in one of the datacenters
*Drake pokes Espeon
<TimeShift> how many had been there already...dunno...all I know is we have around 5000 logical servers running in my region
<Creideiki> Nono, I mean something like the S/360, S/370, S/370-XA, ESA/370, ESA/390, z/System; and the clones of those.
<AeroDracohem> Heya pplz~

<AeroDracohem> it's exactly 9 actually
<Lyon> 04lol
<Proto> I get too into games
<AeroDracohem> XD
<Lyon> 04it's exactly 10 over here XD

<Phoenix> 2o_o
<Phoenix> 2...
<Lyon> 04lolwut @Kipis quit
<TimeShift> that's why we have between 30 to 50 LPARs running on one of those machines. Depends on what the LPAR is needed for

<Brother|Polish> Lyon: how do guilds work in morrowind anyway?
<Lyon> 04uh
<Lyon> 04you join them
<Lyon> 04you get their services
<Brother|Polish> no; like
<Lyon> 04you do quests for rewards
<Brother|Polish> how tedious are they
<Lyon> 04that's basically it
<Lyon> 04oh
<Lyon> 04well
<Lyon> 04it depends on the Guild
<Lyon> 04but most are rather tedious, but some are pretty fun
<Brother|Polish> Say..that Imperial cultish thing
<Lyon> 04?
<Lyon> 04oh that is ridiculously easy at the start
<Brother|Polish> Oh
<Lyon> 04but I never got to the later quests so I don't know
<Brother|Polish> i thought it was hard if you wanted to join all the guilds XD
<Brother|Polish> which apperently you can in oblivion
<Brother|Polish> and its really suprising how advancements work
<Lyon> 04in Morrowind, if you join some guilds and complete them you can't join other guilds
<Brother|Polish> usually 1 or 2 people do it
<Brother|Polish> XD
<Brother|Polish> Bethseda wanted to change that :P
<Lyon> 04a Prime example of this is the Fighters Guild
<Brother|Polish> let me guess..
<Brother|Polish> if you join fighters guild
<Brother|Polish> then you can't join thieves guild?
<Lyon> 04yup
<Lyon> 04well
<Lyon> 04if you haven't finished all the quests you still can
<Brother|Polish> because the fighters guild fights :p
<Andres> Sleeptime.
<Andres> Good night.
<Brother|Polish> ah
<Brother|Polish> So..what if you're leader you can't be bothered to do such things?
<Lyon> 04but once you finish the last two quests you can no longer join the Theives guild
<Lyon> 04I can't say why because it'll spoil the quests
<Brother|Polish> XD
<Brother|Polish> well for advancment in oblivion..it gets rather dumb
<Brother|Polish> though theres a mod that mocks it XD
<Lyon> 04lol
<Brother|Polish> yeah killing all the guild heads and ranimus polis basically kills the mages guild
<Brother|Polish> they can't do anything for ranimus is literally
<Lyon> 04lol
<Brother|Polish> the only guy who will promote you
<Lyon> 04heh
<Brother|Polish> while in DB for example
<Brother|Polish> theres 3
<InfamousZed> i am the invisible man... i am the invisible man...
<Brother|Polish> the vampire
<Lyon> 04the head of the Mages guild in Morrowind is an absolute idiot
<Brother|Polish> the argonican
<Brother|Polish> *Argonian
<Brother|Polish> and the cool speaker
<Lyon> 04lol
<Brother|Polish> well can't say he's better then Hannibal Traven
<Brother|Polish> the idiot o the whole entire guild
<Lyon> 04I'm guessing being a vampire in Oblivion is cooler than in Morrowind?
<Brother|Polish> It is
<Brother|Polish> though you can use some tricks to get around feeding
<Lyon> 04lo
<Brother|Polish> waiting; never do it
<Lyon> 04LOL
<Brother|Polish> just fast travel
<INVADER_TODD> 3Hi
<Lyon> 04hi
<Brother|Polish> and the sun
<Brother|Polish> will never
<Brother|Polish> hurt you
<Brother|Polish> :D
<Brother|Polish> just feed
<Lyon> 04lol
<Brother|Polish> and never wait, which this triggers probablly the script or action to begin the 'vampiring' process
<Brother|Polish> though you can only be a vampire
<Brother|Polish> which completely is lame

<Drake> 04how are you Sky?

<Skylands> 10Fine, you?
<Lyon> 04there are Werewolves in the Morrowind Expansion, Bloodmoon
<Brother|Polish> Yeah
<Drake> 04I'm good, a bit tired
<Brother|Polish> but these mods make that look stupid :p
<Brother|Polish> for theres a bit of a twist
<Skylands> 10don't have much to keep me un-bored, though
<Brother|Polish> at night you must feed, and the werewolfs look like werewolfs
<Drake> 04:|
<Brother|Polish> i suspect mods copied from mods

<Brother|Polish> since Legends of the North werewolfs
<Brother|Polish> look exactly like werewolfs and "curse of hircine" mod

<KyroTheMozilla> 05lol i know that
<drf-Droid> almost home
<drf-Droid> brb
<KyroTheMozilla> 05theres a rule with me to, if its on me, and i dont want it to be or dont know about it, i kill it, if i dont care, pick it up, and let it go
<KyroTheMozilla> 05thats more the rule for spiders, but other bugs like that count
<INVADER_TODD> 3There is something wrong with the chat... Every time I go to a tab it exits and when I try to sign in, it saidit was in use.....
<PokemonStar> 13I only kill it if its about to harm me :|
<KyroTheMozilla> 05the only reason it got in my house in the first place was because of my air conditioner, for some reason they can get through the fan inside and sneak into my bedroom
<PokemonStar> 13xD
<KyroTheMozilla> 05its not just moths either
<INVADER_TODD> 3sparky.... food? really?
<KyroTheMozilla> 05crazy June Bugs, and these little tiny black beetle things, those bettles that jump and make a click noise, all kinds of crap comes through there
<PokemonStar> 13Well, you can try to get it fixed; I'm sure someone could do something about it
<INVADER_TODD> 3I accedentally read it as Sparkly food
<INVADER_TODD> 3awaaaay
<KyroTheMozilla> 05lol theres nothing wrong with the air conditioner, its works fine and very fantasmic, but even the fan going at the highest speed still let them through, but sometimes depending on the size, lol, i sometimes hear a small grinding noise D:
<INVADER_TODD> 3why does everyone hate me?
<PokemonStar> 13Well,you could try to board up where they're coming in
<KyroTheMozilla> 05~.~ wouldnt that defeat the purpose of the air conditioner?
*PokemonStar 13thinks
<INVADER_TODD> 3Why?
<Glacymr> 12o-o
<INVADER_TODD> 3wut
<Glacymr> 12nuting
<INVADER_TODD> 3im leaving
<Glacymr> 12nuthing
<Dream17903> back
<Dream17903> connection :P
<PokemonStar> 13As I said; you could get someone professional to look at it, maybe turn up the speed, or you could block the sides of the air conditioner so the bugs don't come near at all.

<drfsupercenter> 03EW IPODS
<Theguesst> It just took a trip to the apple store to get the firmware repaired
<Theguesst> And the os correctly installed
<Theguesst> And because of the os, I kept having connection problems
*Aristeo waves to all the people who just joined :)
<Aristeo> weeeeeeeeeeee
<Theguesst> They should be nonexistant now

<Proto> Why thank you madame
<Prince-dari> LIES! IOS 80 has been patched. DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD:
<drfsupercenter> 03APple should be nonexistant now
<Theguesst> I beg to differ
<drfsupercenter> 03orly
<Prince-dari> Hmm, brb, need to check IOS 249.
<drfsupercenter> 03all their products are inferior to others on the market anyway
<Theguesst> They're fixing all their AT&T problems that have been there for 3 yard
<Aristeo> Hehe, it's like a kitty :D
<Theguesst> Years*
*Aristeo pets DarkTruth

<Zen> Hey

<DarkTruth> grrrr >_>
<drfsupercenter> 03it's still inferior to other hardware
<Zen> :>
<Proto> oop, gonna get bit ar
*DarkTruth cuffs Proto
<Proto> Aristeo*
<DarkTruth> and yes I have them
<Proto> pff
<Theguesst> So I don't see any reason to hate them anymore
<drfsupercenter> 03I do.
<DarkTruth> and no not the pink fuzzy ones
<Proto> That thought never crossed my mind
<Theguesst> Except that they refuse to speed up iTunes for pc's.
<Proto> Well, now it is
<Zen> I'm trying hard to learn about mIRC scripting
<Proto> but it hadn't before
<Zen> it's crazy-complex
<Theguesst> That I can complain about
<Stitch[Away]> Not really.
<Theguesst> Think of one good reason to hate them
<Theguesst> Besides what I just said
<Zen> if you get into DLLs and filehandling it is
<Stitch> ...
<Stitch> Nevermind, then.
<Zen> not to mention DDE handling
<drfsupercenter> 03There are lots of reasons.
<drfsupercenter> 03One, they charge way too much for what you get
<Theguesst> Gimme one
<Theguesst> Not anymore
<drfsupercenter> 03Two, even with "updated", other brands still make FAR technologically superior products
<Zen> I'm trying to write a custom script to show what I'm playing in Winamp,
*drfsupercenter pokes the $150 8GB iPod Nano
<drfsupercenter> 038GB Sansa is like $50
<drfsupercenter> 03I fail to see your defense
<Zen> and allow users to dcc download it, should they wish
<Theguesst> Yeah, but does it do videos and radio
<Theguesst> And Bluetooth
<drfsupercenter> 03Absolutely.
<drfsupercenter> 03wtf bluetooth
<Zen> but that requires filehandling, DDE commands, and possibly tapping into Winamp's DLLs
<Zen> I think it's a little above my reach
<Light_Lati> back
<drfsupercenter> 03but yes, Sansas have had radio since WAY before iPods have
<Light_Latias> back
<drfsupercenter> 03in fact APple kinda ripped that off them
<Armageddon> 02wb
<drfsupercenter> 03Sansas can even RECORD the radio
<Light_Lati> o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03as well as voice
<drfsupercenter> 03and it's like 1/3 of the pric

<Glacymr> 12hi

<drfsupercenter> 03Theguesst, it's as good as any
<Light_Lati> and hai~
<Light_Lati> kay
<drfsupercenter> 03a third reason: APple is like the leaders in CLOSED source, if you want OSX you have to buy their crappy hardware too
<Glacymr> 12i'm having difficulty
<Theguesst> Good as any?
<Light_Lati> did you get the bottles?
<drfsupercenter> 03unlike Microsoft where you can just put it on w/e

<Theguesst> And want to listen to music
<drfsupercenter> 03you mean does it use flash?
<Light_Latias> ty
<Theguesst> Battery life and portability
<drfsupercenter> 038GB is not a hard drive, it has flash memory
<drfsupercenter> 03Plus
<drfsupercenter> 03Sansas have MicroSD card slots
<drfsupercenter> 03iPods have NEVER had that
<Theguesst> That's what i mean
<Glacymr> 12i CAN
<drfsupercenter> 03you can easily double your space
<Glacymr> 12can't beat him
<drfsupercenter> 03with a simple card
<Zen> does anyone have any experience with that stuff?
<Light_Lati> oh
<Glacymr> 12i can't wack the lightnings balls just right so they hit him back
<drfsupercenter> 03and that's just one particular mp3 player, there's lots of them LOL
<Light_Lati> how many hearts do you have?
<Glacymr> 126
<Theguesst> What about other formats
<Light_Lati> no wonder XD
<Theguesst> Not just .mp3
<Light_Lati> go heart piece hunting o3o
*Light_Lati hmms
<Glacymr> 12i found like a billion heart pieces
<Glacymr> 12but i can't get them
<drfsupercenter> 03more than iPods have...
<Light_Lati> LOL
<Theguesst> Stuff like .aac, wav
<drfsupercenter> 03it'll do mp3, m4a, OGG, etc
<eXAKR> Meep
<Light_Lati> ok
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah

<drfsupercenter> 03well wtf .aac
<drfsupercenter> 03it'll do m4a
<drfsupercenter> 03which is the same thing
<drfsupercenter> 03it'll do WAV
<drfsupercenter> 03and mp3, and mp4, and w/e
<drfsupercenter> 03most players will do more formats than iPods >_>
<Glacymr> 12right now i'm messing with TP

<eXAKR> I left my iPhone connected to IRC overnight
<Glacymr> 12trying to figure out what i'm doing wrong with fishing
*Light_Lati hmms
<Theguesst> How easy is it for an idiot to use?
<Theguesst> Like say, my whole family
<Light_Lati> I haven't played TP in a time lol
<Light_Lati> but anyway
<Light_Lati> in OoT...
*Light_Lati thinks

<drfsupercenter> 03LOL @ idiots
<drfsupercenter> 03ask LL, I sent her a Sansa
<drfsupercenter> 03I think it's just as easy to use as iPods
<Light_Lati> did you get the 2 in the graveyard as an adult?
<drfsupercenter> 03plus you can actually put Rockbox on them :D
<Glacymr> 12no
<drfsupercenter> 03you used to be able to on iPods, but not in the past ... like 5 years you can't
<eXAKR> What
<drfsupercenter> 03but you still can on Sandisk players
<Glacymr> 12i got one
<eXAKR> !lag
<Altair> [eXAKR] Lag with ocean.lugia.us is 1.404secs
<Glacymr> 12but i don't remember how i got it XD

<Glacymr> 12no
<eXAKR> Ok, not too bad
<Light_Lati> O-O
<eXAKR> What
<Light_Lati> re-race Dampe
<Theguesst> Glac, I could help after I convince drf apple isn't that bad

<Light_Lati> then go to the windmill for the other
<Theguesst> Aka*
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Light_Lati> *up to the windmill
<drfsupercenter> 03So far I haven't seen any valid reasons why they aren't bad
<Theguesst> Let's move on to the phone
<drfsupercenter> 03compared to other products
<drfsupercenter> 03EW IPHONES
<Glacymr> 12i'd much rather figure out fishing right now
<drfsupercenter> 03Android works better by far >_>
<Theguesst> Why do you hate the iPhone?
<Theguesst> Reason
<Light_Lati> kay
<Theguesst> I need one
<drfsupercenter> 03First of all, no actual keyboard
<Phoenix> 2o.o
<Theguesst> I can deal with that
<drfsupercenter> 03secondly, WTF only one button?
<drfsupercenter> 03if your phone freezes you're SOL
<Phoenix> 2lol
<Theguesst> I'm using no keyboard right now
<Theguesst> It's not all bad
<drfsupercenter> 03eh
<drfsupercenter> 03I've heard f people having their iPhones freeze and they literally have to wait til the battery runs out for it to restart
<Theguesst> I would make the same mistakes on a real keyboard
<drfsupercenter> 03that's the other thing
<drfsupercenter> 03you can actually remove the battery of the DRoid
<Theguesst> Yeah, like you'd keep your droid for the next 7 years
<Theguesst> You won't need to replace it
*Light_Lati reads
<drfsupercenter> 03what's your point
<drfsupercenter> 03batteries can die dude
<drfsupercenter> 03plus if it FREEZES
<drfsupercenter> 03you can just pop it out
<drfsupercenter> 03iPhones you have to like, hold buttons for a while, realize you're screwed, and sit and wait
<drfsupercenter> 03or maybe smash it
<drfsupercenter> 03that might also fix the freezing
<Theguesst> If the iPhone freezes, it's your fauly
<Theguesst> Just like a droid
<drfsupercenter> 03orly?
<drfsupercenter> 03ever heard of FAULTY SOFTWARE?
<Theguesst> Harpy
<Armageddon> 02ALTAIR
<drfsupercenter> 03if the only thing you EVER use is the browser, maybe
*Armageddon snugs
<Theguesst> Ya rly
<drfsupercenter> 03but obviously you'd get third party apps
<drfsupercenter> 03and those are known to freeze
<Altair> NS!
*Altair snugs back
<Theguesst> <_<brb turning autocorrect off
<drfsupercenter> 03see, my Droid doesn't need autocorrect, it has a keyboard
*drfsupercenter hides
<Theguesst> Well some of us aren't that literate
<Armageddon> 02;3
<drfsupercenter> 03wtf?
<Armageddon> 02http://i627.photobucket.com/albums/tt357/palmo6/pkm.png
<Armageddon> 02Altair
<Light_Latias> :o
<drfsupercenter> 03you can't spell words in English without a computer helping you?
<Theguesst> Or are and are just hindered by this
<drfsupercenter> 03That's kinda sad
<Armageddon> 02put that up for an affiliate plz
*Armageddon lazy
*Light_Latias goes back to reading o3o
<Altair> url?
<Theguesst> I was jk ing
<Armageddon> 02and add tohjofall's new button
<Armageddon> 02um
<Altair> jesus
<Theguesst> You're sad D:<
<Armageddon> 02http://s1.zetaboards.com/PokemonDistrict/site/
<Altair> that needs to stop changing
<Armageddon> 02I know
<Armageddon> 02>>
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03whatever
<drfsupercenter> 03moving along, APple's computers
<Altair> i'm not going to change it again
<Armageddon> 02oh wait
<Sneas> 03maybe Alt can de it
<Armageddon> 02nvm
<drfsupercenter> 03you can take the same hardware and build a Windows or Linux machine for about half the cost
<Sneas> 03do
<Armageddon> 02XD
<drfsupercenter> 03with even faster processors and whatnot
<Altair> do what?
<Armageddon> 02And SpooKy should seriously
<Altair> also :3@Snea
<Theguesst> Hating a company for mistakes easily comparable to r corporations
<Altair> s
<drfsupercenter> 03WTF $1000 for a MacBook? with only a 2.2GHz dual core?
<Theguesst> Other*
<Armageddon> 02just use one url
<Armageddon> 02and reupload it
<drfsupercenter> 03You can get even like a $500 crap laptop with a faster processor than that
<Theguesst> Well don't buy the f in thing
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't
<Theguesst> The Mac mini
<drfsupercenter> 03what about it
<Theguesst> If you want a Mac, you get it for osX
<Theguesst> Not for the hardware
<drfsupercenter> 03that's beside the point
<drfsupercenter> 03if Apple weren't evil you could easily put OSX on your own built computer
<drfsupercenter> 03but you can't, which yet another reason I hate them :P
<drfsupercenter> 03that and OSX is stupidly annoying, I see nothing you can do in it that other OSes can't do
<Theguesst> Well that's why they sell the freaking Mac
<drfsupercenter> 03yes, to quote a friend: people who use Macs have more money than brians
<drfsupercenter> 03*Brains
<Theguesst> If they sold osX to pc users, it would be somewhere around $400
<drfsupercenter> 03so?
<drfsupercenter> 03WIndows is like $300 'full'
<drfsupercenter> 03I get it for free thanks to my school though
<drfsupercenter> 03not pirated, either
<Theguesst> So would you spend that or just buy their frickin hardware with it
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd rather spend the SAME money and get BETTER hardware
<Theguesst> The built quality is unmatched
<drfsupercenter> 03what>?
<Theguesst> It'll last 10 years
<Theguesst> At least
<drfsupercenter> 03orly
<drfsupercenter> 03my university has some Macs that are like 3-4 years old and are already sluggish and slow
<Brother|Polish> those poor Macs
<Theguesst> Ya rly
<Theguesst> Well they've never heard of clearing their history
<Theguesst> Another thing
<Theguesst> Marketing
<Theguesst> Apple markets the Mac to the mainstream tech idiot who doesn't know what start on a pc does
<drfsupercenter> 03Theguesst, what? it boots from an image
<drfsupercenter> 03every time someone restarts the computer it erases any changes made
<drfsupercenter> 03what history are you referring to?
*Aristeo doesn't :3
<Theguesst> They expect that osX will do enough to last them
<drfsupercenter> 03I still don't see your point
<drfsupercenter> 03if you're an idiot, then sure get a Mac... but that doesn't make it a valid reason for me not to dislike them
<drfsupercenter> 03as I actually know how to use a computer
<Theguesst> I was receding to temporary internet files last time
<drfsupercenter> 03I know
<Theguesst> I do too
<drfsupercenter> 03but it ERASES THAT
<drfsupercenter> 03when you log off
<drfsupercenter> 03as do the Windows machines
<Theguesst> Not really
<Zen> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03yes it does
<drfsupercenter> 03you've never heard of a bootup image before?
<Theguesst> I have
<Theguesst> I think we got lost somewhere
<drfsupercenter> 03brb, regardless.
<Proto> I used to be able to make a fork bomb and make %random% number scroll on the screen

<Light_Lati> 1p ish meh :/
<Theguesst> My friends used to play multi all the time
<Theguesst> I logged it
<Theguesst> Loved*
<Proto> It basically tells windows to open a file or run something in cmd or something like that, can't remember the details, and it just opens cmd prompts endlessly, can't do anything, the pc crashes
<Proto> I did it to a junk school computer >.>
<Theguesst> And yes, the campaign is Meg
<Theguesst> Meh*
<Proto> Totally unplugged that thing in about three seconds
<Theguesst> And autocorrect is >_>
<Light_Lati> lol
<Theguesst> So yeah
<Light_Lati> the only reason to go 1p is for the extra characters no?
<Theguesst> Yep
<Theguesst> O'donnel
<Light_Lati> kay
*Light_Lati doesnt own the game

<Prince-da> /j #wiihelp
<Theguesst> ...
<Bunnyfitten> 7=3
<Prince-da> !rules
<IOS61> Prince-da: You are now being sent the rules. Please check for a tab/window/button labelled 'IOS61'
<IOS61> Rules for #wiihelp:
<IOS61> 1. NO PIRACY (or back-ups, don't go pretending, they are the same thing)! We're happy to help with getting the latest emulator to work but you'll be kicked (or banned) if you ask where to get ROMs etc. How to install VC / WiiWare games or asking where to get them will get you an instant ban as will asking for .ISOs or asking on support for modchips or any other piracy or backup-related topics.
<IOS61> (For the purposes of this channel, the term "softmod" shall be defined as "any software installable to the wii that will allow you to play illegally obtained wii games". Softmodding in and of itself is illegal, and therefore it and anything pertaining to it falls under the category of piracy. Softmodding does NOT mean "installing homebrew channel", "homebrewing your wii", or anything of that nature.)

<bkerensa> You Have Been Spammed! http://www.qwertymash.com
<bkerensa> You Have Been Spammed! http://www.qwertymash.com
<IOS61> (Further, a "hardmod" is the same as a softmod, except that it is a hardware chip physically installed into your wii. Together, these are referred to as "mods" and are therefore illegal and fall under the piracy rule.)

<bkerensa> You Have Been Spammed! http://www.qwertymash.com
<bkerensa> You Have Been Spammed! http://www.qwertymash.com
<IOS61> 2. There is no need to ask 'Can I ask a question' - just jump straight in with it
<IOS61> 3. No offtopic talk. This is particularly annoying for those trying to ask legitiate questions. There are other channels for off topic wii chat (try #wiidevot). Ops have the final word on what is and what isn't offtopic and offenders will be kicked and then banned
<IOS61> 4. We have all the ops that we need - do not ask to be an op. If you are a regula helper you may be promoted to have voice and should we need more ops we will promote from there
<IOS61> 5. No IRC scripts / bots without permission (but as long as the bot is not annoying or obtrusive, we will likely not decline). This includes autorejoin and away messages (apart from non-intrusive ones - ones that do not count as a real message, for example changing nicks or using /away)
<IOS61> 6. Flooding / autojointhere are bots in place to stop this. Persistent offenders will be banned
<IOS61> 7. No flaming (insulting / abusing other users)
<IOS61> 8. For more detailed dev help try #wiidev and for low level info try #hackmii. #wiidevot should be used for offtopic. Do not post links to other channels apart from these (though if it is not piracy-related and will genuinely help, it tends to be allowed).
<IOS61> 9. Our bots are here to help. Abuse of commands such as !seen and the searches will get you kicked.
<IOS61> 10. Don't talk in CAPITAL letters, people will find this anoying and will only ignore you
<IOS61> 11. Don't advertise websites or channels unless they contain useful information relating to the problem at hand. Always use Wiibrew if possible.

<Proto> Hi
<Brother> ah..Found it!
<Soyuz> wb
<Brother> and how was the game lyon
<Lyon> 04?
<Lyon> 04good
<Brother> Halo?
<chr0m> is it worth going to cios rev19?
<chr0m> still on 17 here
<RuPeRt> u have to
<Marach> only if you encounter problems
<chr0m> have to?
<RuPeRt> i had to do
<chr0m> i stayed with 17 because it works with triiforce
<RuPeRt> 17 then do 19 at the end
<Marach> ?
<chr0m> but i probably won't use triiforce now my hdd has been wiped
<chr0m> couldn't be fucked setting it all up again
<chr0m> besides using sneek for wiiware now
<Marach> if everything's working, why'd you want to change stuff?
<chr0m> i notice some things won't read from usb hdd using 17
<chr0m> i think 19 solves that
<Marach> try then
<chr0m> i will, was just wondering if anyone knew any compelling reason to switch or not
<Marach> can't say, i'm not into usb loading
<RuPeRt> chrom
<RuPeRt> due to newer games
<RuPeRt> iu need rev19
<Marach> isn't "things won't read" enough o a reason?
<RuPeRt> from what i understood with cfg loader
<Marach> i need to clean my "f" key
<|Shadow|> rev19 finaly fixs DL support
<chr0m> RuPeRt: i use cfgloader and everything seems to work
<Marach> somehow
<chr0m> but some other homebrew would complain about reading from usb
<chr0m> i think stuff like wad manager
<RuPeRt> anone got a rapid share accot i can use for about 25 mins

<Drake> 04HAHAHAHA
<Brother> its 6:29 am o3o
<Drake> 04MY INTERNET IS BACK TO NORMAL SPEED
*Drake whoops
<zu-zu> 12so get ready for a battle nick
*Soyuz gives Drake the cake
<Shiny> Darnit, just a few more messages and you would've been kicked
<Nick> 12wait what D:
<Espeon> I don't comment as much as people seem to think... at least not anymore. And I'd love to give people constructive criticism but I have bad experience with it to say at least <<
*Shiny would've laughed
<Brother> and now its 6 30
<Drake> 04lolshiny
<Nick> 12nooo I bruise easily! *flees
<Drake> 04and Espeon, I'm the same
<Drake> 04except with Sprites
<Shiny> Same here
<Nick> 12(and besides we have to cut down on the rping in main chat)
<Soyuz> I dont comment at all mostly
*Drake throws the cake at Soyuz "Don't give me your lies!"
<Soyuz> wait
<zu-zu> 12no we are going against weak pokemon nick
<Soyuz> then that meaks you threw a lie :O
<Soyuz> LIER
<Espeon> but in general dA is the wrong place to be if you want that. 95% of comments will either be praise or unconstructive critisism.
<Espeon> you can't deny this
<zu-zu> 12torchick,treecko and mudkip
<Shiny> I don't
<Soyuz> I mean look what happened to Aurora XD
<Soyuz> she asked for it
<Soyuz> and only like 5-4 people did that
<Espeon> Yeah. You shouldn't really have to ask for it though :/
<Soyuz> she's an artist for life
<Soyuz> thats her deal
<Nick> 12well if its full of rattatas and bidoofs can I bring my minigun? VRMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM 9000+ dead ratatas+bidoofs
<Espeon> But then again, so many people aren't looking to improve... sad truth
<zu-zu> 12sure
<Soyuz> actually here's my Communist bet
<Soyuz> a majority of DA mostly exist
<Shiny> My pet peeve about comments are people who just post "Nice picture :)" and nothing else
<Soyuz> to be Worshipers of several people
<Soyuz> like take for example..
<Shiny> I mean, I would actually like to know WHAT'S nice about it
<Soyuz> that one girl
<Soyuz> who makes those spyro comics
<Espeon> In fact I agree Shiny. I mean if someone says like "Nice, I really like how the <stuff> came out :)" then it's instantly 100 times better
<Soyuz> literally people just worship her art
<Espeon> True
<Espeon> that happens to many
<Soyuz> In which I do say
<Soyuz> DA is pathetic
<Soyuz> the versions and changes?
<Espeon> and they get blinded and don't improve, and then they become stuck up bitches :3
<Soyuz> who cares
<Soyuz> at least if there is construction of art
<Shiny> I have a lot of people I look up to, but I don't worship them
<Soyuz> I'm happy and jolly
<Espeon> I really facepalm at fanclubs for artists on dA
<Espeon> like really
<Soyuz> Ha
<Soyuz> hahahaha
*Shiny doesn't go around kissing awesome artist's feet for nothing
<Espeon> ^
<Soyuz> and they say we created personality cults
<Soyuz> DA is a site for that crap
<Kipikipo> >:3
<Brother> ohai sir kipi
<Drake> 04Espeon
*Kipikipo chews on the next person
<Espeon> I mean I had a period where I tried to be constructive
<Drake> 04if you facepalm at fanclubs for artists
<Espeon> over 50% of the comments got hidden
<Kipikipo> Not Zu Zu
<Soyuz> why?
<Drake> 04would you facepalm at Fanclubs for a persons OC?
<Espeon> and/or their fanboys/-girls called me a "meanie"
*Kipikipo noms his own tail.
<Soyuz> Drake:
<Espeon> yes I would
<Kipikipo> :3
<Soyuz> YES
<Drake> 04good
<Drake> 04because I did too
<Espeon> so hard that the wall behind me would fall
<zu-zu> 12>:3
<Soyuz> theres one girl
<Drake> 04Go look at Shalonesk's page
<Soyuz> I have
<Soyuz> thats the girl
<Kipikipo> I knew you were gonna type somethin'
<Soyuz> and may I say one terrible thing?
<Drake> 04there is a fanclub of her character, Zonoya, and another for two of her characters
<Kipikipo> So I interrupted ya
<Drake> 04and yes
<Drake> 04go
<Shiny> I understand that you like a certain person's OC
<Espeon> lol facepalm
<Kipikipo> Hyahahaha
<Soyuz> she creates spyro porno
<Drake> 04I know
<Drake> 04although I've never seen hers
<Soyuz> I have >.>
<Soyuz> I died
<Drake> 04but I do know she does
<Drake> 04lol
<Espeon> well that explains part of her popularity
<Shiny> I mean, I know a comic artist who has watchers who've made stamps for her characters in her comics
<Soyuz> and god did not resurect me 3 days later
<Soyuz> he did it 5 days later
<Shiny> But hopefully not a fan club
<Drake> 04lol
*Espeon sees her art and imagines porn in that style
<Drake> 04ewfanclub
<Espeon> what is this
<Espeon> i don't evne

<Drake> 04Shiny
<Soyuz> Espeon; she has done prono
<Drake> 04she's made a fanstamp of her comic
<Drake> 04which I find ok
<Soyuz> in which she has her OC
<Soyuz> and a character that has no sexual desire
<Drake> 04lol
<Soyuz> Do a 'yiff'
<Shiny> Umm...you're on a different deviant artist Lyon
<Espeon> great

<Drake> 04._.
<Kipikipo> I'm borrowing GTA4, just to hear you complain about how much you dislike it. >:3
<Brother> Erm..

<Nick> 12yeah SR2>>>>>>>>GTA4
<Kipikipo> IS THAT IT!?
<Kipikipo> You hate me for no reason??
<Drake> 04tbh, I don't want to get better as an artist in general
<Kipikipo> What is wrong with you, Brother!?
<Drake> 04I just draw for fun, not as a life
<Lucario> 12gta4 is a great game
<Soyuz> unlike some people
*Soyuz dies
<Drake> 04sure, I'd like to get better in a few little areas
<Drake> 04but nothing major
<Kipikipo> Why must you judge me for the color of my skin, Brother?
<Espeon> I'm like Drake
<Soyuz> I can barely draw
<Kipikipo> I've done nothing wrong!
<Soyuz> My majors are in what are expected of me
<Soyuz> in all honesty I wish I had the style of a 1930s Soviet artist
<Lucario> 12except all the cars handle like the wheels are made of cheese and there is an elephant in the passenger seat. Made of concrete.
<Soyuz> but I dont
<Soyuz> so I deal with this
<Shiny> Hey, I draw as a life
<Espeon> I mean if you upload your art you should agree to the fact some people might want to help you improve.
<Kipikipo> Brother
<Shiny> Well, I plan to anyways
<Espeon> and that isn't done by saying "so kawaii"
<Brother> add you where?
<Kipikipo> I will never trust you again
<Kipikipo> Never
<Drake> 04Espeon, I understand that, and if people want to help me, then I'll let them give me advice
<Brother> Lucario: but hey
<Shiny> That's why I didn't run back here crying because Brother gave me critique
<Brother> at least you can fly now :O
<Soyuz> Espeon
<Nick> 12Loocareooh mah boi
<zu-zu> 12well i gotta go now bye

<Espeon> I loath japanese phrases used by anime fangirls/-boys
<Espeon> I think it means cute
<Absol> kawaii?
<Espeon> but it's like the master race of "cute"
<Shiny> It's Wapanese for chibi/cute
<Shiny> cuddly
<Espeon> big eyes, more bloom tool, and sparkly like a twilight vampire
<Drake> 04oh
<Shiny> Y'know, the K for the C!

<Soyuz> but not because it girl on girl
*Shiny FLEES

<Espeon> lol
<Soyuz> he rose from the gamer grave and became our savior
<Soyuz> he died for your hours
<Shiny> No...don't give Spyro a bad name

<Kipikipo> Chimera?
<Espeon> ctrl + u hue 100 ??? profit
<Espeon> recolour 101
<Soyuz> Shiny: they need to kill whoever is urkle
<Soyuz> he did a voice in for spyro
<Soyuz> in the adventures of sonic the headgehog
<Soyuz> the 90s was cursed
<Shiny> Yet we all loved it
<TimeShift> CSI Arti - check it out^^
<Soyuz> what are you talking about
<Soyuz> we all hated it
<Soyuz> it had no sense
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 12XP restarted due to updates -v-
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 12I'ts back
<Soyuz> not Sat AM
<Soyuz> the other one
<Soyuz> the insane one
<Drake> 04:\
<Shiny> That's because it took half our lives to make the shows slowly weaken into stupidity
<Soyuz> its a good thing I was born in 95 then :D
<Shiny> Hurray for using Pokemon move references
<Shiny> Also, Lyon what do you think of The Last Airbender? (movie)
<Soyuz> Drake: do you read her comic as well?
<Drake> 04er, that real-time one?
<Soyuz> yes
<Soyuz> the one with all the white people
<Drake> 04and Soyuz, who are you talking about?
<Shiny> Yes, that would be the movie
<Drake> 04I haven't seen it
<Drake> 04but my opinion so far, is 'wtf'
<Soyuz> the girl that made the spyro comic
<Shiny> I second that
<Soyuz> which has porn in it
<Drake> 04uh
<Shiny> I actually saw the behind the scenes, and this was their inspiration for making the movie:
<Soyuz> I make the claim; why the white people and whats the point
<Soyuz> a little girl
<Drake> 04Shalone doesn't have porn IN the comic
<Soyuz> thats because she never posts it
<Soyuz> but she made a little comic of the molest of zonoya
<Drake> 04ovo
<Espeon> lol
<Soyuz> lets just say no one was a happy camper
<Drake> 04hurr
<Espeon> I misread zonoya as zorua EVERY time /random
<Drake> 04I doubt that, I'm sure alot of people were happy
<Shiny> Director: "Well, my daughter started watching this show, and she got me to watch it, so me and the group sat down and started watching Avatar the Last Airbender. We couldn't stop watching it, so I thought *Hey, we should make a movie of this* and so we all got to work on it"
<Espeon> ..-.
<Drake> 04Hey, Director-man
<Drake> 04maybe try making an animated one next time
<Soyuz> my response to director;
<Shiny> The style was completely off in the movie
<Soyuz> try putting asians in next time~
<Shiny> I mean, this one scene, the water bending teacher who taught Aang, made this ball of water and KICKED IT
<Shiny> Too much earthbending in waterbending
<Soyuz> and basically they have to have the element
<Soyuz> to bend it
<Soyuz> so no spontaious fire
<Shiny> Yeah, so fire benders can't just shoot fire out of themselves anymore, even though they explained why in the animation
<Luna> Why asians? Avatar isn't even an anime o.o
<Soyuz> Why?
<Soyuz> for theres not only too many white people
<Shiny> Because the creators actually based it off of Asian culture and anime
<Soyuz> But its suppose to be Asian oriented
<Kipikipo> Good thing it's quiet
<Soyuz> based off the cultures of Asian
<Kipikipo> Otherwise I'd be too distracted to make illegal drugs.
<Soyuz> and last time I check white people =/= Asia
<Shiny> I mean, Momo is Japanese for peach, which Momo was eating when Aang named him
<Shiny> The bending styles are all based off of kung fu styles
<Soyuz> Also
<Soyuz> drake: its offical
<Soyuz> shes a narutard
<Drake> 04lol
<Soyuz> a furry one to >>
<Luna> I thought momo was pink... Ah well
<Shiny> Air Nomads have the same beliefs as Buddhism
<Soyuz> *cough*pascifistidiots*cough
<Espeon> lol, narutards
<Soyuz> also
<Soyuz> who is this thorn guy
<Soyuz> she makes all these pictures for him when dragons just apperently flop over for him
<Soyuz> heck alot of people do that o.o
<Shiny> There was calligraphy in the show
<Drake> 04lol
<Drake> 04I knwo who 'Thorn' is based off
<Drake> 04so it makes it even scarier
<Drake> 04and yes, I know who you are talking about
<Soyuz> Drake: who?
<Soyuz> fot I have no clue
<Soyuz> I'mm too..intelligent and resistent to drama
<Drake> 04you know Eragon? The Movie or the Book?
<Drake> 04Thorn is one of the dragons in it.
<Soyuz> :|
<Soyuz> So what
<Drake> 04The fact of how she draws him and what he asks for is SCARY
<Soyuz> this guy thorn
<Soyuz> LOL
<Soyuz> i can make a dirty joke about that
<Soyuz> but I resist it
<Drake> 04LOL

<Drake> 04http://cynder-and-spyro-fan.deviantart.com/
<Soyuz> but in any case
<Drake> 04CASF is like, my ultimate art idol
<Absol> I dislike "it's female, it must have breasts"
<Drake> 04^
<Soyuz> what do you call big lumbs on her chest?
<Espeon> I dislike "It's female, it must have gigantic breasts"
<Soyuz> and dont you dare say a dirty word
<Soyuz> Espeon:
<Soyuz> we think the same
<Soyuz> only reality is against us
<Espeon> and Drake, I can't find anything bad about her so 1-0 to her I guess |D
<Drake> 04>.>
<Drake> 04<.<
<Drake> 04lol
<Drake> 04well me
<Drake> 04meh*
<Absol> male-dominated art is male-dominated
<Drake> 04bah
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 12BBQs starting
<Drake> 04even girls do it
<Soyuz> male-dominated art
<Soyuz> is boring
<Drake> 04Shalone draws Cynder with breasts
<Drake> 04its scary
<Lyon> 04ohai LLOTS
<Espeon> also, I like how in (be it dragonstuff or furrystuff) they always put ... human parts.
<Soyuz> and a planet of fans cired out in anguish
<Soyuz> and sunndely died
<Espeon> that sorta creeps me out
<Soyuz> Furries
<Espeon> or well, not always but you know
<Drake> 04lolespeon
<Soyuz> they apoloclypse of today
<Espeon> ESPECIALLY on the females. Always human parts minus the fur.

<Drake> 04CASF?
<Drake> 04yeah
<Soyuz> which made...more sense then the other two
<Soyuz> npw I remember her
<Drake> 04only hers is much higher quality + takes longer for the next one to come out
<Soyuz> plus
<Soyuz> her art is good
<Drake> 04tbh I prefer cell-shading
<Soyuz> impressive
<Drake> 04hey
<Drake> 04CASF's art is amazing IMO
<Espeon> She does really good art indeed.
<Soyuz> oh look

<Absol> still, lipstick + dragon = no
<Soyuz> ^
<Drake> 04if your OC has a love interest woth another OC, I'm fine with that, as I have done that myself
<Soyuz> No
<Soyuz> they dont
<Drake> 04sorry
<Soyuz> the point is to just create art, its a request
<Absol> ?
<Soyuz> no an art trade
<Drake> 04let me rephrase that
<Soyuz> Absol: but guess what
<Soyuz> they wear clothing too
<Drake> 04if your OC has a love interest with another of your OCs, I'm fine with that
<Soyuz> so its lipstick + clothing + dragon
<Drake> 04...
<Drake> 04HOLY SHI

<Soyuz> Drake: thats shakolenaldbakd girl
<Drake> 04clothing + Dragon is ok if done right

<Absol> but I lost it at some point
<Soyuz> well did they have to put wood in there?

<Soyuz> I dont want to imagine spyro being frodo
<Soyuz> Absol: the 'new spyro'
<Soyuz> is made by elaijah wood
<Soyuz> aska
<Drake> 04he is voiced by Elijah Wood
<Soyuz> *aka
<Soyuz> Frodo from LOTR

<Drake> 04Cynder's voice actors from ANB and DotD were pretty good as well
<Drake> 04TEN...meh
<Absol> I don't play games much
<Drake> 04anyway
<Absol> and none of them really interest me incredibly a lot

<Neonkeks> 10HEY WHAT I SAYD?
<gamefunne> hi.
<Neonkeks> 10...
<Neonkeks> 10>.>
*Kipikipo licks Neonkeks
<Neonkeks> 10ok..
*zu-zu 4roars at the sky
<GeneraLee> ^Wulfgar^: so bsically it is possible to softmod any wii if the FW is below 4.3...correct?
<Neonkeks> 10hm^^
<Kipikipo> Now that was uncalled for. The Sky didn't do anything to you.
*zu-zu 4glares at Neonkeks
<gamefunne> Yes. And u can downgrade 4.3 to 4.1.
<gamefunne> i know im not wulfgar ^^
<GeneraLee> oh, inclusive 4.3 then
*zu-zu 4glares at Kipikipo
<Neonkeks> 10what?
<gamefunne> yes but only if u downgrade to 4.1
<GeneraLee> ok fine
<gamefunne> why?
<Neonkeks> 10why u glare at us?
<Mathew_Wi> Why downgrade?
<SpooKy> ESPEON
<Kipikipo> X3 He thinks we look good.
<GeneraLee> not sure if im going to find any locally
<SpooKy> I NEED UR HELP
<Neonkeks> 10o.o;;
<zu-zu> 4IM A SHE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<gamefunne> its not possible to hack 4.3 YET
<Kipikipo> That's what I said.
<zu-zu> 4DID NOT!!!!
<Neonkeks> 10ok...
<Mathew_Wi> You just can't install HBC on it.
<SpooKy> ESPPY
<gamefunne> yes
<Kipikipo> You misheard me or something then, because I clearly said "she".
<GeneraLee> sorry, im missing something, i though you said that i can downgrade to 4.1, and then it is exploitable...
*Neonkeks squints
<gamefunne> but everything u hack is addicted to hbc
<Kipikipo> 06:29 <Kipikipo> X3 She thinks we look good.
<zu-zu> 4no tou sentance said "HE"
<Kipikipo> See?
<GeneraLee> whats is hbc/
<GeneraLee> ?
<gamefunne> i think so yes
<Kipikipo> I just copied and pasted it right there
<gamefunne> hbc is a hacked channel wich reads ur sd
<GeneraLee> oh ok
<Espeon> o.O
<gamefunne> and then u can install hacks from the sd
<gamefunne> and everything else
<Kipikipo> It has a timestamp so you know it's the real deal.
<gamefunne> generalee im not sure
<gamefunne> but u can update to 4.2 if it isnt possible to hack 4.1
*zu-zu 4lookes up to find she almost got hit by a meteor
<gamefunne> and then u can hack 4.2
<GeneraLee> yes, i did use that dummies guide to softmod a wii b4, now im considering a new wii, but not sure if an exploitable ones are still available :)
<Mathew_Wi> 4.1 is hackable.
<Mathew_Wi> Just make sure you install the correct IOS before you "Downgrade"
<Mathew_Wi> :P
<gamefunne> u have to downgrade the correct ios to downgrade the wii
<gamefunne> so downgrading IS installing other (old) ios
<Mathew_Wi> Or you'll brick.
<zu-zu> 4hi two people i dont know ^^
<GeneraLee> yes, i will remember that :) i think in the old one, the wrong IOS or something was installed, so the wii was 1/2 brick << not sure if this make an sense...but it was pain to fix it...
*Neonkeks listen 'Love the Way you Lie' 'Eminem'
<gamefunne> xD
<Kipikipo> Good thing Kyu isn't really there.
<gamefunne> just install the system menu
<gamefunne> again
<gamefunne> with a hack
<Mathew_Wi> Which menu?

*Kipikipo sells them for $

<zu-zu> 4???
<^Wulfgar^> there are two guides.. one for 3.1-4.1 and one for 4.2
<Mathew_Wi> None for 4.3?
<Kipikipo> Whoa, bro.
<gamefunne> no
<^Wulfgar^> you can't softmod a 4.3 unless it was softmodded before updating to 4.3
<Kipikipo> Now that is too many ?'s.
<gamefunne> u have to downgrade 4.3 to 4.1
<zu-zu> 4timeshift im doing your avatar
<Kipikipo> Are you TRYING to anger the ? God?
<Espeon> lmao Youtube gets more messed up every minute
<^Wulfgar^> gamefunne, that ONLY works if it was softmodded before you upgraded to 4.3
<gamefunne> ? downgrade
<gamefunne> really?
<Mathew_Wi> You could always use korean IOS.
<^Wulfgar^> read
<gamefunne> i didnt know that
<Mathew_Wi> Apparently ninty didn't update them with 4.3
*Neonkeks listen a funny song

<GeneraLee> ? downgrade
*Neonkeks listen EMIN3M with Underground
<GeneraLee> nice :)
<Mathew_Wi> Someone could make a TBR mod.
<Prince-da> I could downgrade from 4.3, if MMM didn't turn off my wiimote, and then refuse to sync it.
<Neonkeks> 10brb
<Mathew_Wi> MMM?
<^Wulfgar^> you need to have a cios installed to downgrade 4.3
<Prince-da> MultiModManager
<Prince-da> Nope, I found a guide for doing it without.
*Andres shakes his head, drying his hair through the dog method.
<^Wulfgar^> obviously doesn't work if you can't sync your wiimote after running MMM
<Prince-da> Have to use exploits in either SSBB or Lego Indiana Jones.
<Prince-da> It does sync for some people.
<^Wulfgar^> which is why it's not supported here
<Prince-da> And it would if I had a GC controller... :(
<Mathew_Wi> What would having a GC controller do to help sync it?
<TimeShift> watch the TST meet livestream on http://nest.lugia.us:8080/?src=1
<Prince-da> GC controllers always seem to work, even when wiimotes fail to sync.

<xarcus> ok w8
*zu-zu 4cries
<xarcus> done
<lukegb> okay
<lukegb> Now
<lukegb> Move boot.elf to the root of the SD card
<lukegb> (boot.elf is inside hackmii_installer)
<xarcus> ok
<lukegb> Oh, by the way
<lukegb> When you copied the private folder, did you ALREADY have a private folder?
*zu-zu 4talks to imanimate items
<xarcus> no
<lukegb> Okay then, you should be all set
<lukegb> Put the SD card in your Wii and hit the SD card menu button on the System Menu homepage
<GeneraLee> is the wii region free?
<xarcus> load boot.dol/.elf?
<xarcus> probably yes
<lukegb> Yes.
<GeneraLee> i can get ntsc/u or pal, so i was curious...
<xarcus> hackmii installer appeared now
<xarcus> hit continue?
<lukegb> Yes.
<lukegb> Do you have any red text on your screen, below the green text?
<GeneraLee> ? brickblocker
<xarcus> i think it was not red but it sid something like i kould only be installed using iso ...
<Blackwolf> yes
<xarcus> i was bootmii
<Blackwolf> you can change video mode it outputs as with somthing like cfg loader
<Chimera> ohay~
<^Wulfgar^> there ARE some games that are region locked
<Hurricane> O_o
<xarcus> ios it was
<^Wulfgar^> it's always recommended to get games that match the region of your wii
<Chimera> ?
<lukegb> yeah, okay.
<Hurricane> nothing
<xarcus> ok hbc and dvdx where installed
<zu-zu> 4hello?
<GeneraLee> thnx, pal is cheaper so i will get myself one then
<Blackwolf> were you asking for a stock wii?
<Puma81> have a happy and safe 4th everyone
<Blackwolf> not hacked?
<Blackwolf> cause thats a diffrent story
<GeneraLee> yes
<^Wulfgar^> buy a wii that matches your region
<GeneraLee> stock
<^Wulfgar^> ^
<^Wulfgar^> if you're in the states, get an ntsc wii
<GeneraLee> isnt hacked wii region free...?
<^Wulfgar^> no
<GeneraLee> ooooh
<xarcus> what should i do about bootmii?
<GeneraLee> :)
<lukegb> install it as IOS, if you want
<GeneraLee> i prefer ntsc because of the games are usually released b4 other regions, all my consoles are imported although im in a pal region
<GeneraLee> since the N64 days :)
<xarcus> ok all done i think
<^Wulfgar^> if you're in a pal region, then get a pal wii
<Puma81> not to mention pal voltage
<Espeon> Chimerah
<xarcus> do i have to do something els
<GeneraLee> in my house we have both 110/220, it is the standard here to provide the 2
<humi655> ciao
<GeneraLee> i prefer the ntsc, unless as you guys said there exit a utility that will convert the pal wii to ntsc, pal wii is cheaper here
<^Wulfgar^> again...if you're in the pal region, get a pal wii
<^Wulfgar^> if you're in the ntsc region, get an ntsc wii
<^Wulfgar^> it's really not THAT complicated
<^Wulfgar^> you CAN run most ntsc games on a pal wii...especially if you're going to use a usb loader
<GeneraLee> i am going to use a usb loader
<GeneraLee> yes
<GeneraLee> so ok
<^Wulfgar^> then I recommend getting a wd passport usb hdd, best around imo
<Puma81> lol
<xarcus> ?
<Puma81> yup^
<GeneraLee> or very cheap enclosure and 750GB WD internal HDD :)
<Puma81> essentials are nice
<^Wulfgar^> 750gb is major overkill for wii
<zu-zu> anyone want to be in my picture?
<DarkundeR> yep yep
<^Wulfgar^> if you're going to use the usb hdd JUST for wii, 320gb is more than enough
<GeneraLee> i think the difference in price is not that much between the 500 and 750
<Chimera> hai
<^Wulfgar^> keep in mind that not all enclosures are compatible with the wii
<Chimera> OH MY GOD MY PARENTS >_<
<zu-zu> i can only have about 4 or 5 buddies in my picture
<^Wulfgar^> even 500gb is overkill
<Chimera> I'll be back at like 5:00 maybe

<Darkhunter101> !espeon
<Puma81> i say even less lol
*Espeon now belongs to Darkhunter101 for 13 minutes
<GeneraLee> i recall you can use 2 partitions, one for the wii and the other just storage
<Puma81> 200-250 is PLENTY

<zu-zu> HEEELLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO?
*Darkhunter101 hugs Espeon
<Puma81> you can use an many partitions as you want

<^Wulfgar^> fat32 all the way

<Puma81> fat32 fir the homebrew
<^Wulfgar^> there's no need for ntfs
<Hurricane> o.o
<Espeon> .-.
<Puma81> size limitation
<zu-zu> is anyone ther hello
<^Wulfgar^> there is no need for ntfs
<^Wulfgar^> convert .iso to .wbfs, throw on fat32 formatted usb hdd and play
<Puma81> i like to archive on my drive too wulf
<GeneraLee> i think fat32 does not support files larger than 4 GB
<^Wulfgar^> I'm talking strictly wii
<Puma81> i put my HD movies on there aswell
<TimeShift> I'm here
<zu-zu> wanna be in my pic Bunnyfitten and timeshift
<GeneraLee> the best thing about fat32 is that it is well documented
<^Wulfgar^> if you're going to partition a drive, then use fat32 for wii and whatever for the rest
<TimeShift> well, why not?
<GeneraLee> compared to ntfs for instance
<Bunnyfitten> 7sure
<Sneas> 03
<GeneraLee> ok ^Wulfgar^
<zu-zu> timeshift chose what pokemon you want to be apart from lugia
<zu-zu> same for you Bunnyfitten
<TimeShift> eh? something else but that?
<xarcus> ahh works thanks a lot
<zu-zu> yes lugia is to hard
<Bunnyfitten> 7hmmmm....
<DarkundeR> programs auto split 4gig files
<DarkundeR> but if you plan to stream movies and they are larger then 4gigs then go NTFS
<Bunnyfitten> 7Electrike?
<DarkundeR> if its just for wii games Fat32
<^Wulfgar^> if you're streaming, they won't be on the usb hdd anyhow
<zu-zu> im a girl rayquaza with a neakelace that shows a sun behind a cloud
<DarkundeR> i meant coping movies to your harddrive to watch them :P
<DarkundeR> instead of streaming
<zu-zu> electrike will do
<DarkundeR> :)
<DarkundeR> Wii can't handle streaming movies that are > 1gig
<^Wulfgar^> wii isn't hd anyhow...so why you'd want to put a hd movie (bigger than 4gb) on your usb hdd is pointless
<DarkundeR> wifi too slow
<zu-zu> you decided timeshift
<TimeShift> dunno in fact^^
<^Wulfgar^> I stream 1.5gb movies just fine
<zu-zu> chose a random one
*Bunnyfitten 7changes her mind "Buneary seems more fitting for me."
<DarkundeR> it can handle low quality streams no matter what the size. but streaming a DVD or HD kills it
<zu-zu> timeshift be an electrike!
<^Wulfgar^> as I said, wii isn't HD anyhow...so why you'd wanna play a HD movie on it is beyond me
<zu-zu> please?
<TimeShift> meh
<zu-zu> is that a yes timeshift
<DarkundeR> even non HD DVD's stream for crap...
<TimeShift> it's a meh, not more and not less
<DarkundeR> if converted to XVID work fine
<EpicStatsGuy> Floof has arrived!
<zu-zu> so i just make an electrike
<zu-zu> skylands wanna be in my pic?

<yuyuyup> so you want anarchy everywhere, huge corporations with private cops, no street lights, etc
<jse> gorvnment is phail
<jse> actually anarchy if you study believes in small government
<jse> so no
<jse> anarchy phails
<yuyuyup> I guess in your opinion people don't deserve cops or laws or any social protection at all
<yuyuyup> fire engines
<yuyuyup> streets
<jse> indeed
<jse> no cops for certain
<jse> there are nothing but the states inforcers of tyranny
<yuyuyup> well you sir are certainly not listening to enough Thom Hartmann
<yuyuyup> or Randi motherfucking Rhodes for that matter

<Perseid> [13:25] <jse> actually anarchy if you study believes in small government
<Perseid> Huh?
<power1> anyone know what i need to play old nes games on my wii
<Perseid> Anarchy = no government
<jse> not true
<yuyuyup> if I was in England I'd be fucking pissed at the gillion cams everywhere
<power1> i got alot roms
<yuyuyup> fuck that shit
<yuyuyup> I would carry a "fuck you big brother" sign everywhere
<jse> nihilism is more that believe than ararchism Perseid
<power1> ? wiibrew
<yuyuyup> till they send me to guantanamo
<Perseid> Um, yes, true.http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/anarchy?r=75
<jse> we are pissed off by it yuyuyup
<yuyuyup> well get involved
<yuyuyup> or else that shit happens
<jse> there is no point though yuyuyup
<jse> no matter who you will pick to govern they will do the same shit
<jse> hence government phails
<jse> perse do some study of emma goldmen
<jse> her speaches and writings
<power1> can anyone help me to put nes roms on sd card and play them
<jse> roms or vc wad's ?
<power1> i got roms
<jse> http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Nes
<power1> ill check it out
<jse> need to download the emulator and extract it to the apps folder on your sd card
<power1> i just make a apps folder and a roms folder on my sd card
<Super_Son> Isn't there a sort of "flag" that allows me to delete the Forecast Channel via the Data Management screen?
<jse> not quite
<power1> what then
<jse> you want it like this sd:\apps\nes\
*Licht is away (***Obey the darkness inside you***)
<jse> create that and in that dir you want the files from the rar
<jse> like boot.dol *.png *.xml ect...
<power1> not quite sure lol
<jse> create a folder on sd called apps
<power1> ok done
<jse> in there create a folder called nes
<jse> in there extract the files from the emulator
<power1> whats the best emulator
<jse> look like for some reason that the emulator will not load games from sd
<jse> you can either burn them to dvd or load them of the network
<power1> so it wont work from sd card
<jse> the emulator will
<power1> ok
<jse> roms wont according to http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Nes#Loading_Games
<power1> whats the best emulator
<jse> that one i believe
<jse> but vc is probably better
<jse> as its a devd by big n
<travolta> "ROMs & saves files should be stored in fceugx/roms and fceugx/saves on the root of your SD card, USB flash drive, or SMB share. "

<Xai> 05watching it now
<Articuno> 12And you get all mad at him
<Xai> 05bye
<Articuno> 12Also you're the only one who calls zu-zu an idiot
<drfsupercenter> 03that's because TimeShift just takes every opportunity to argue with me
<drfsupercenter> 03Articuno, LOL, you agreed she was a n00b at first, why are you changing your mind?
<zu-zuXtimeshift> go and pick on someone your own size and age drf
<TimeShift> it's not my fault if you're a target like an open barn's gate
<Articuno> 12I do agree but I don't agree with name calling unless it's you because you know Im messing about
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<drfsupercenter> 03well I just get annoyed at n00bs being on here -_-
<zu-zuXtimeshift> :(...
<Articuno> 12WTF
<Articuno> 12I just got a PM from zu-zu asking me why I called myself gay!?
<Articuno> 12Who's been typing on my computer?
<zu-zuXtimeshift> not me
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL what
<Articuno> 12It'll have been someone at the meet today
<zu-zuXtimeshift> well you did say it arti
<Articuno> 12No, someone was using my keyboard
<zu-zuXtimeshift> oh
<Articuno> 12But what's annoying me actually is that you said it's sick and you won't be talking to me again
<Articuno> 12That's homophobic and discriminative
<Articuno> 12I'd rather not talk to someone who says things like that anyway.
<drfsupercenter> 03I never understood how the term homophobic was used to mean *hating* gays
<Andrew> sorry arti that was me XF
<drfsupercenter> 03when phobias are *fears*
<Andrew> XD
<zu-zuXtimeshift> well its because you said it i didn't like it it upset me
<Articuno> 12LOL
<Articuno> 12So what if I WAS gay?
<drfsupercenter> 03then Xai would be mad?
*drfsupercenter hides
<Andrew> you ARE gay
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Andrew> the happy sort
<Articuno> 12There's loads of gay people on the chat, maybe you should leave if you are so offended by them!
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o are there?
<Articuno> 12Yes???
<drfsupercenter> 03I generally don't ask XD
<Articuno> 12Lol no one needs to ask
<zu-zuXtimeshift> yeah but im 11 and everyone is older than me everyone is like older than 15 years old
*Arcanine growls at Espeon
<Articuno> 12You're 11 so that makes it ok for you to hate gay people now..?
<Articuno> 12I'm actually slightly offended by your PM, you don't call people sick, that's what racists used todo
<Espeon> http://xelig00n.deviantart.com/art/Awesome-Floof-170044201
<Espeon> your new overlord
<Espeon> :3
<zu-zuXtimeshift> im not racist...
<Arcanine> 04Espeon
<Arcanine> 04its happened again
<Articuno> 12I never said you were
<Articuno> 12I'm just saying that people who hate gays are the same as racists
<Espeon> o3o
<Espeon> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
<proppi> ? list
<Espeon> mod "Espeon" on there
<zu-zuXtimeshift> :(.....
<Arcanine> 04i can't get out of bed
<Espeon> lol
<Arcanine> 04i don't feel well x-x
<Espeon> :<
*Espeon pats
<Arcanine> 04eep
<Arcanine> 04horrible stomach ache
<Arcanine> 04i think i might just kill the server
*zu-zuXtimeshift sits all alone
<Espeon> xD
<Arcanine> 04and start it up again but set a limit on the number of people who can join
<Arcanine> 04does 20 sound good?
<TimeShift> there's nothing like a "normal" pattern. It's just an "average" we like to use as "normal". But this doesn't make everthing standing outside of this "average" state equal to be "bad", "wrong" or sick
<Espeon> 30 should work.
<Articuno> 12Right the photos are resized, time to sort through each one
<TimeShift> take me for instance. Few people like Lugia and other of those wonderful beings at my age. It's not target for this average group, yet I'm not "sick" or such
<zu-zuXtimeshift> arti...that thing you said about leaving maybe i will leave
<TimeShift> thogh - if I was infected by a disease because I admire Lugia that much, then hell, I'm proud of being sick!
<zu-zuXtimeshift> and make drfsupercenter very happy
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not that I don't want you here, you just act like a little kid
<Articuno> 12She is LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03exactly
<Articuno> 12Not that it's a bad thing
<Articuno> 12Just that it's not really tolerated in places like this
<TimeShift> so are you sometimes drf :P
<zu-zuXtimeshift> :(
<drfsupercenter> 03I've always thought people start using IRC at WAY too young of ages LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean, if you act mature that's fine
<drfsupercenter> 03but eh
<drfsupercenter> 03TimeShift, LOL, sometimes sure but not ALL the time
<zu-zuXtimeshift> so your calling me childish
<drfsupercenter> 03yes
<Arcanine> 04i don't think 30 is severe enough
<Espeon> o3o
<zu-zuXtimeshift> hmp
<Arcanine> 04sigh
<Arcanine> 04i wish Nightshadow could be here XD
<Arcanine> 04this is the reason i was afraid of making the server public
<matthieu> bonsoir
<Arcanine> 04sure strangers are joining now but i haven't seen any of them really join because they have an interest
<Arcanine> 04they either join because the official server is down or to just be a random troll
<Espeon> lol
<zu-zuXtimeshift> here have a nice glass of lemonade drf
<Arcanine> 04i can't wait until Presea can takeover
<zu-zuXtimeshift> articuno im doing a picture of you
<zu-zuXtimeshift> and me aswell
<Espeon> lol
<matthieu> une mise a jour de bannerbomb compatible wii 4.3 est elle prevue de sortie ?

<Nick> hey skylands
<Skylands> 10Heya
<TimeShift> I just watched a clip from Ghost in the Shell: Innocence in english on Youtube....and I realized the americans seem to SUCK in almost EVERY translation/adaption of japanese anime movies oO
<Nick> well the japanese animators animate lip movement so they speak japanese
<TimeShift> this EPIC japanese background music, this summoning song giving the scenes such a DENSE atmosphere...they MUTED it out almost ENTIRELY
<Articuno> 12Yep
<Articuno> 12Well look what they did to Revelation Lugia
<TimeShift> are they brainf***ed or what?
<Articuno> 12Destroyed a beautiful soundtrack
<TimeShift> same goes for the first Movie
<Articuno> 12Yeh.. wow
<drfsupercenter> 03Articuno, what
<TimeShift> or who do you think would be DUMB(!!!) enough to CUT a 16:9 movie into a 4:3 aspect ratio?
<Articuno> 12Now that was a dark movie, until the dubbers got hold of it
<drfsupercenter> 03Pokmon 2000 dub has like
<drfsupercenter> 03the best score ever
<drfsupercenter> 03:)
<Andrew> Articuno those photos are really good
<drfsupercenter> 03<TimeShift> or who do you think would be DUMB(!!!) enough to CUT a 16:9 movie into a 4:3 aspect ratio? <-- that is not the dub's fault
<drfsupercenter> 03that's VIZ.
<Articuno> 12It's not bad.. but it's too ... I dunno something
<Aurora> 6I agree with drf
<Articuno> 12Revelation Lugia is a lot better
<drfsupercenter> 03as it was released in proper widescreen everywhere besides America -_-
<Aurora> 6except pokemon 3 is better
<Aurora> 6by far
<drfsupercenter> 03I even have it in high definition
<Articuno> 12Like the bad guy actually has bad guy sounding music

<Proto> Ohsnap

*Andres curls up naked.
<Stryker> :3
<DarkundeR> You should ask them!
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14LOL
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Those Guitars in the arcades today failed like hell
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Way too much lag
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Either that or just majorly unresponsive
<Nick> and srsly heavy
<yuyuyupo> no I need to convince the nation to join my voice
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14The weight of them doesn't bother me
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Well
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14It does
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Since I'm used to those lightweight ones
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14But the arcade guitars just fail
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Way too much lag and stuff
<Nick> yeha
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14But damn
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I saw a song on the arcade GH
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14THAT I REALLY WANT TO PLAY
*Andres puts on the previous pants!
<spacer76> !rules
<Stryker> No.
<IOS61> spacer76: You are now being sent the rules. Please check for a tab/window/button labelled 'IOS61'
*Stryker takes those, too.
<Andres> `D:
*Stryker eats them.
<Andres> No?
<Andres> :((
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14And that's this

<Nick> wasnt on the normal game was it?
*Stryker giggles and sits under Andres.
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14No :<
<Andres> o.o
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14It's not on my Arcade machines either D:
<Proto> o_O
<Espeon> myaaawn
<Stryker> What? D:
<Andres> Why would you sit under a naked fat man? D:
<Proto> Why are you sitting under him? D:
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14And wow at Leeds' GH Arcade, the premium songs need 4 to play :|
<Soyuz> ohai PS
<Andrew> bleh
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14They only need 2 here
<Stryker> Why not? D:
<Nick> !!!
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I thought that was pathetic man
<Nick> what a rip
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 144 to play just one song
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14and the premium songs suck anyway
<Proto> I want my flashlight =[
<Andrew> to be honest i think arcades in general are bit of a con
<Andres> Strykah is silly ._.
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14The only thing in an arcade that ISN'T a con are the DDR Machines
<Andrew> i was sad they removed the pool table, as that was the only thing i wanted to play :P
*Stryker curls up on Andres' lap.
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14XD
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I mis playing pool
<Andres> o.o
*Andres huggles?
<Stryker> :3
*Proto lights his shoes on fire
*Stryker licks the Andres' hand.
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14But anyway guys it really was awesome to see you all again
<Andrew> likewise
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Wish I could've stayed longer tbh
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I don't think I've had that much fun since the November meet XD
<spacer76> just wondering if there's already a fix for 003 unauthorized access error ?
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14And Andrew it's ok for you, you can basically see Arti and Xai whenever :P
*Andres summons tea and gives Strykah a cup!
*Stryker eats the cup.
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14You don't have to travel for 4 and a half hours on a train XD
<Andres> :3
*Stryker meows at the Andres.
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14But yeah, what I'm trying to say is, that I will attempt to make every meet from now onwards
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Not only does it get me away from Southend and all the crap I'll deal with, but I have more fun up in Leeds than I would with my friends here
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14And that says alot
<|Shadow|> yuyuyupo, u will always be a fatso

<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14The best thing about the Summer Meet
<Sneas> Hi
<|Shadow|> why downgrade?
*Stryker meows and rubs her head against Aristeo's leg.
<Aristeo> :o
<Aristeo> KITTY!
*Aristeo picks Stryker up and hugs her
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I was able to stay for a weekend
<Nick> what?
*Aristeo puts Stryker up on his monitor
<Andres> That probably means that she is no longer curled up in my lap :o

<Brother> whats up may
<May> Hiya Nick =3
*Andres gives Proto a fireball.
*Proto bursts into flames
<May> Brother, we're getting ready for a barbeque
<lukegb> Yeah, you're going to have to wait for a wii game with 4.3K
<Proto> Gee, thanks
<lukegb> Update on it
<May> we got lots of stuff, including explosives
<lukegb> Then use the rescue menu to install 4.3
<May> happy explosives day
<Brother> XD
<Nick> and the new spiderman will be in the high school years like ultimate spidey so says IGN
<Brother> I slept most of the day
<Nick> which means we'll be getting scrawny spider-kid :\
<Brother> Nick: they better not screw that one up
<lukegb> If I think it's the right error...
<|Shadow|> Bieber, quit being a dumbass
<May> sundays always seem to be boring :<
<spacer76> looks lite this channel topic says 4.3 is out ? any idea which games use 4.3 ?
<Bieber> :p sorry
<Andres> Flames!
*Andres sets himself on fire!
<lukegb> None have it on disc yet, I'm afraid.
<Bieber> i was bored peace
<Andres> Yay for being a part-time fire elemental!
<Brother> ultimate spider ma was at least semi good in my view
<spacer76> bummer :s
<Aristeo> Andres: What happened to Kikaimegami? :o
<lukegb> spacer76: do you have a modchip in your wii, perchance?
<oxy> raaaaaandy said you stole 'baby baby' from him Bieber
<lukegb> I'm not going to ban you if you say yes, I'm trying to help.
<Nick> I didnt like the ultimate series, I liked the sort of 90s cartoon where he was actually a man, and seemed like buff and strong, not that skinny style
<lukegb> I have one in my wii, after all. Ahh, the days where the hbc could be installed via trucha'd dvd.
<spacer76> i guess only softmodded, only neo... was on the menu screen
<IOS61> spacer76: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
<lukegb> Ahh
<Andres> I dunno :o
<Brother> meh the 90s cartoons animation was...well not tha good
<Andres> I think she is alive.
<Brother> it was good in plot
<Andres> I still have hosting from her!
<Brother> but the animation coud have least been worked on
<spacer76> and hbc was also installed
<Andrew> in the 3rd spiderman movie he turns emo
<lukegb> Well, you're gonna have to wait for a disc with 4.3K
<lukegb> Sorry.
<Brother> they should have shown more Venom in that movie
<Brother> everyone got screentime but him XD
<Nick> I thought the animation from the 90s was pretty good they did seem to put detail into the character models
<spacer76> no problem ... i guess it wouldn't be so much time untill 4.3 will be on a disc
*Stryker throws a letter at Andres.
<oxy> http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/08/raaaaaaaandy-gets-ripped_n_489971.html
<Brother> I dont mean like character detail
<spacer76> btw is there any way to downgrade from the rescue menu to 4.1 or so ?
<Brother> more like if you watch it for a really long time
<Andres> :o
<Brother> you see all of this repeats in animation
<Proto> It was a L!
<lukegb> No, don't think so.
<Stryker> Yes!
*Andres opens it, but can not read Strykahese.
<Andres> Oh, ok. D:
<Nick> oh yeah the recycled animation
<Nick> all shows do that
<Proto> Grr
<Brother> and you havent seen that 'ultimate spider man' anime right?
<Proto> my GOW disk is buried
<Andrew> needs more spider pig tbh
<Andres> Strykah, Strykahese sounds nice, yes? :o
*Stryker writes nonsense on Andres' knee.
<Brother> ^
<Andres> Which one? D:
<Stryker> Both!
<Andres> D:
<Andres> They are covered in too much hair!
<Andres> You will never make it!
<Stryker> D:
<Andres> It's a jungle down there!
<Andres> And there is a Scar there who keeps welcoming people D:
<Brother> but yeah Nick the newer anime, or cartoon, is bascially like the skinny version
<Brother> super skinny
*Stryker eats the scar.
<May> floof floof floof for Roara
<Nick> theres a spidey anime?
<May> try saying that three times fast
<Brother> the floof as left the building
<Brother> Yes nick
<Andres> D:
<May> I miss the sea of floof
<Brother> well its more like a cartoon
<Andres> But it covered pretty much the whole of my right knee :/
*Andres bleeds to death.
<Brother> only its better then most cartoon animations
<Brother> and i believe I found the first youtube user who sounds like a robot
<Stryker> D:
*Stryker uses Aristeo to heal the wound and revive the Andres.
<Stryker> God.
<Stryker> I am bored.
<Aristeo> Yes?
<Aristeo> Oh
<Stryker> Just ignore me.
<Stryker> Hi!
<Aristeo> www.i-am-bored.com
<Stryker> Yeah. That doesn't work for me.
<Proto> I need xbox live
*Andres bites Strykah on the ear.
*Stryker dies.
<Proto> Then I can get pwnd by everyone in l4d2
<Proto> D:
*Proto casts Life on Stitch
<Proto> Stryker*
<Stryker> D:
<jasperbot> lol
*Stryker hits Proto's tab key.
<Proto> honest, I was aiming for Stryker >.>
<Andres> If you brought her back to life, you destroyed my cure for her boredom! D:
<Andres> Dead people are not bored!
<Andres> Thus, people that are not bored are dead! D:
*Andres panics!
<Glacymr> 12oh yayz
<Stryker> :O
*Stryker panics more than the Andres.
<Glacymr> 12drf is back from watching independence day
<drf-Droid> LOL
<Brother> he is watching indepedence day
<Proto> :O
<Brother> though its not that good of a movie :P
<drf-Droid> :O
*Andres hides from the Strykah.
<drf-Droid> no I'm not, and it's a great movie
*Stryker hides from the Andres.
<Stryker> More than the Andres!
*Andres hides from the Andres too.
*Proto screws up his realod
<Proto> reload*
<Brother> it has 2 plots
<Stryker> Oh. Gears of War. D:
<Brother> sexual drama and being killed by aliens
<Proto> mhmm
<Sneas> I
<Sneas> I
<Brother> though thats most movies
<Soyuz> o3o
<Brother> and wow at this video -_-
<TimeShift> k, another proof in craziness
<TimeShift> example of observation: Trailer of Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence
*Andres builds a mechanical warmachine made out of gears!
<Andres> And only gears!
<Andres> It shoots gears!
<Proto> >.>
<Sneas> Bbl
<Proto> I'm am seriously going to attach a miniature chainsaw to a rifle
<jasperbot> that's what she said
<TimeShift> Japanese original: Atmospheric trailer, few pictures, lots of talking and symbolic speech, presentation of the original creators
<TimeShift> german trailer: presentation of a new, epic story, introduction it is a sequel, the movie's about a mysterious new case, presentation of a dense story, very atmospheric
<Brother> english trailer; why do you bother
<TimeShift> american trailer: Lots of shooting, guns, cannons, blades and similar in several still images, over two thirds of the movie are just about shooting others
<TimeShift> density, depth and story: Slim to none in the american trailer
<TimeShift> I start to understand why there're over 500 quoteable lines in the japanese version, around 300 in the german and 12 in the english version....
*Andres is rather sleepy.
<Andres> Or just bored.
<TimeShift> plus the voice of Batou sucks in english
*Proto offers Andres a fireball
<TimeShift> and so does the voice of Togusa
<Soyuz> wb
*Andres eats it! :D
*Andres feels warm :3
<TimeShift> considering both are in the movie about the entire time, this renders the english dub useless. Luckily there's still a subbed version for the american folks
<Nick> wb roara
<TimeShift> whoever feels to compare himself, take a look at the american trailer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPCpcB2RjiM
<TimeShift> and the german trailer afterwards: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rmsi1TV2KxU
<Prince-da> Meh, ordered a GC controller, so I can downgrade from 4.3 in a couple days.
<TimeShift> despite you don't understand everything (or even not a single thing^^") in the german anime, tell me afterwards which one covers more story and gives you more idea of the atmosphere
<Prince-dari> Meh, I don't really like anime anyway, but I've always found watching the original with subtitles best.
*Aristeo offers Andres some thermite for dessert :)
<Andres> Yay!
*Andres mixes it into ice cream and noms!
<Proto> lolwut
<Proto> It sounded like Kim was making the chainsaw noise
<Proto> I shot the grunt he was trying to saw, but he was making the noise still ._.
*Andres chainsaws a monkey!

<May> birds, of course
<May> I always get overly excited when I see hummingbirds
<siestacat> anyone here can help me with my cell phone?
*Andres climbs out of Strykah's mouth and pulls Curly in! :D
<INVADER_TODD> 3oh, interesting....
<Roara> 6I've grown up with them, spent countless hours watching their behaviors
<Athenon> this is not a cell phone help channel
<siestacat> I washed it in the washing machine by accident, and left it in my pocket
<Curly> o.o
<siestacat> I know, but
*Andres takes the Curly to his hut in the Strykah and plays Uno with her!
<siestacat> you guys are tech extremeists
<Stryker> You're now inside me, apparently.
<Curly> o.O
<Curly> O.o

<Athenon> lukegb: ive seen the rule applied more extremely before.
<siestacat> lukegb: my phone was washed, but it still turns on and I can make and recieve calls, but the screen is white
*Drake|Zzz yawns
<lukegb> Athenon: yeah, it just depends on the time.
<siestacat> I tinkered with the wires and things, and air dried it for days, but no luck
*Andres climbs out of the Strykah then <.<
<May> I'd never have time to do that
<siestacat> oddly enough
*Drake|Away poofs again
<siestacat> it DOES turn on when the battery is extremely low
*Stryker keeps the Andres inside of her.
<lukegb> Siestacat: screen borked, buy new phone.
<May> usually always busy with things or I'm just holed up in the house
<siestacat> and I already tried another battery
<lukegb> Athenon: and/or whatever ops are there
<Roara> 6heh
<Roara> 6I haven't done it for a while

<siestacat> so it can't be broken...
<_Dax_> sounds like you're effed, siestacat D:
<lukegb> siestacat: seriously, cell phones are annoying, fiddlu and compact
<Roara> 6but most of that was on my front porch, so time wasn't really an issue

<May> I really don't like hanging around outside out front because of the nieghborhood I live in
<Roara> 6I'd love to see a Costa's Hummingbird again...they're so rare in my area
<Athenon> its that simple. get a new phone.

<Andres> Yay!
<Curly> maybe we should drop the rating down to G
*Andres continues.
<Stryker> But that'd ruin the fun. D:

<Stitch> Ground and Rock.

<Drake> 04so...I can close them?
<Armageddon> go ahead
<Armageddon> I need to VNC :/
<Armageddon> I apparently don't have permissions to load exes on this computer other than the installed programs' exes
<Drake> 04hurr
<Armageddon> so I can't load the VNC viewer
<Armageddon> >>
<Drake> 04thus why I don't use my school laptop
<Armageddon> And I actually really need it
<Proto> Stitch
<Armageddon> Drake
<Drake> 04not to mention it sucks and it lags so much
<Armageddon> Do you think I WANT to use this piece of <censored>?
<Drake> 04no, I'm just saying
<Armageddon> obvious, much
<Armageddon> it lags so badly it's not funny
<Armageddon> and it uses up a LOT of CPU and RAM
<Drake> 04is yours a Mac or a Windows?
<Armageddon> a lot more than it should
<Armageddon> windows 7
<Drake> 04oh wonderful
<Drake> 04we have Macs

<Stitch> http://pokemon.marriland.com/hgss/pokedex/pupitar/
<Drake> 04Vista is annoying to use, but the rest of the Laptop makes up for it
<Armageddon> I don't like Vista and 7
<Proto> I remember what it is :P
<Armageddon> They're harder to use
<Armageddon> I can barely find the retarded Local Disk (C:) and My Computer on this
<Armageddon> and where the <censored> is my documents and the local C drive anyway
<Armageddon> >>
<Drake> 04:|
<Armageddon> And where is the 'Run' thing
<Armageddon> that XP has
<Armageddon> that was actually good
<Armageddon> it meant I didn't need to scroll up to find notepad and MSPaint and cmd
<Armageddon> I'd just go run -> cmd
<Armageddon> or run -> notepad
<Armageddon> or run -> MSpaint or run -> calc
<Armageddon> yes I'm that lazy
<Armageddon> I can't even be bothered to scroll up the start menu to find those programs
<Armageddon> and yay, CGI:IRC fails
<Armageddon> Can't install mIRC or anything for that matter on this fail of a computer
<Armageddon> why it's even called a computer astounds me
<Armageddon> also

<someguy> it just hangs until i reset the wii
<someguy> and my internet is working

<Sonic41> :P
<Athenon> thats why i kban asap and pm them to take it elsewhere ;P
<Sonic41> :P Nice
<Whywhywhy> What did he do wrong?

<Absol> might be closer
<TerrorBite> flame.ho-ohrealm.net 6697, shadow.ambernova.net 6697
<Absol> I don't know where Altair lives
<Drake> 04waitwaitwait

<IamNoob> because GC back up luncher has a mios patcher as i belive
<|Shadow|> this has nothing to do with gc
<IamNoob> ok

<GeneraLee> how do you run GC backups on the wii?
<IamNoob> i use backup luncher for GC
<GeneraLee> dvd-rs?
<IamNoob> you have to use GC controller
<Marach> yeah
<Marach> dvd-r, gc controller and a gc memory card
<GeneraLee> i was hoping to place them all on a usb :)
<IamNoob> dvd-r and you can use multigames in one dvd
<Marach> the launcher is installed directly into mios
<GeneraLee> oh ok
<^Wulfgar^> only wode can run GC off usb
<Marach> so it can be used with *corp
<IamNoob> you can put 3to5 games on a dvd
<Mathew_Wi> That's it?
<GeneraLee> whats wode?
<Marach> i'm not doing that, i'll probably waste more discs trying to get all the games to work
<Mathew_Wi> http://google.com
<|Shadow|> cmios has nothing to do with cioscorps
<^Wulfgar^> http://www.wodejukebox.com/

<IamNoob> no need ot loghe
<^Wulfgar^> mios is for gamecube, cios is for wii

<IamNoob> shadow say i should update to rev19 and my cios is 249
<IamNoob> yes ...
<Mathew_Wi> lol
<^Wulfgar^> you have an outdated 249
<^Wulfgar^> ciosx rev19 will update your 249
<IamNoob> that will do the problem why didnt shadow told me that ?
<[Hideki]> I wonder if it's worth doing a step by step guide with all the files for offline installation, with pictures etc.
<Mathew_Wi> He did.
*Marach 's head implodes
<IamNoob> i wnat to understand what i am doing to my wii not only download and install
<IamNoob> i just hate that
<^Wulfgar^> cause |Shadow| has very little patience lately.. ;)
<IamNoob> jezuz
<Marach> ^Wulfgar^: i see no difference
*Mathew_Wi learns the /me command :D
<^Wulfgar^> see no difference with what?
<Marach> between him now and before
<IamNoob> Hideki it's worth really
<^Wulfgar^> other than he can't kick/ban ;)
<IamNoob> Hideki if you think you are smart then thank your god ffs there is alot of ppl that arnt like you
<Marach> [Hideki]: why offline?
<^Wulfgar^> [Hideki], most people should already have wifi...so an offline guide would be kinda useless imo
<[Hideki]> I don't have any gods, I'm an atheist
<[Hideki]> and why are you barking at me
<IamNoob> Hideki you will be in hell then .. no har dfeelings
<[Hideki]> no I won't, lol

<Marach> ^
<^Wulfgar^> your #wiihack?
<IamNoob> why not i think religion have to be in anything do you agree ?
<IamNoob> kik
<[Hideki]> ^Wulfgar^, I didn't have it, so had to download the files, but if there's no demand I won't bother
<^Wulfgar^> there already is an offline guide
<Marach> [Hideki]: there are good guides for offline installation

<Absol> http://images.4chan.org/v/src/1278332733867.gif
<Presea> lol
<^Wulfgar^> of course
<^Wulfgar^> update to latest cfgloader and you should be fine...also install ciosx rev19 if you haven't
<|doogie|> thanks did not know new ciosx was out
<|doogie|> ? list
<[NiNjA]UK> just put my 2tb ntfs formatted drive onto cfgloader and keeps getting error trying to find wbfs partition....
<[NiNjA]UK> what am i doing wrong :) ?
<ReD^DoG> plugging it in to the wrong port? :
<|doogie|> ? softmod
<[NiNjA]UK> lol ReD^DoG no
<|doogie|> where is good place to get rev 19
<[NiNjA]UK> i have the \wbfs\ folder (as to installed by wbfs manager)
<[NiNjA]UK> |doogie| http://hackmywii.net/custom-iosx-rev19-installer-released
<^Wulfgar^> [NiNjA]UK, got ciosx rev19 installed?
<|doogie|> thanks
<[NiNjA]UK> i believe so , although i am grabbing it again now, just incase
<[NiNjA]UK> hence why i had the link handy lol
<^Wulfgar^> and why ntfs?
<^Wulfgar^> fat32 > * for wii
<[NiNjA]UK> ntfs is better filesystem in my opnion, however wish i did do fat32 now :)
<[NiNjA]UK> it'll get sorted soon enough though, i have full faith in me and advice from ppl :)
<^Wulfgar^> I hope you didn't dedicate the whole 2tb to wii
<[NiNjA]UK> yup
<[NiNjA]UK> 712 games installed
<^Wulfgar^> then I'd definately go with fat32
<^Wulfgar^> I assume you converted .iso to .wbfs
<[NiNjA]UK> i've loaded it up now.. took nearly 28 hours...
<[NiNjA]UK> yes of course :)
<^Wulfgar^> transfered with wii backup manager?
<[NiNjA]UK> yup
<^Wulfgar^> so you have a wbfs folder and inside there each game has it's own folder...and in each folder is a .wbfs file...correct?
<Marach> ...
<Marach> you're doing everything to make him look like an idiot.
<^Wulfgar^> just checking...geezus
<Marach> i guess that's a way of troubleshooting
<[NiNjA]UK> yup all in
<[NiNjA]UK> i am gonna doouble check i have cios19
<^Wulfgar^> using a forwarder for cfgloader?
<[NiNjA]UK> yes

*Andres runs around in circles!
<^Wulfgar^> WHY would you want a wode?
<GeneraLee> for GC isos...
<GeneraLee> thats the only reason
<CrackLtd> yea wode is white
<Marach> i'll never spend as much money on discs as i would on a wode (or a hdd)
<Espeon> o
<GeneraLee> honestly, the main problem is that my system dvd seems d3-2
<GeneraLee> but it seems the wode still will not be able to read backups
<GeneraLee> just isos
<GeneraLee> the honly solution could be replacing the dvd itself
<CrackLtd> here you can see my wii/wode setup: http://img822.imageshack.us/img822/6511/cimg0001.jpg
<GeneraLee> wow, nice
<GeneraLee> :)
<Marach> this spyro isn't running on wii, is it?
<CrackLtd> yea its spyro a heroes tail GC version
<CrackLtd> works smoothly with wode
<Marach> ah
<Marach> hm
<GeneraLee> hmmm! whats the black controller?
<Marach> looks like spyro 1 first world.
<Marach> ccpro
<Marach> i have one
<GeneraLee> better than original GC?
<Marach> nope.
<Marach> :/
<Marach> but priceless for mh3
<GeneraLee> mh3?
<CrackLtd> thats the classic pro controller
<Marach> yes
<Marach> cproc? o_O
<^Wulfgar^> a wode for just gc isos...talk about a waste...gc games are SO old...you can BUY them for next to nothing
<Marach> ^Wulfgar^: not here
<GeneraLee> but they are not available
<GeneraLee> it is much easier to keep them all in iso format
<Marach> did everyone forget dvdrs still exist? :/
<CrackLtd> the alu case is a 1.5TB drive
<KarateBob> ill sell a modded cube to someone
<KarateBob> viper gc chip
<KarateBob> or gx
<KarateBob> w/e it is
<^Wulfgar^> modded cube...lol...just burn 'em...geez
<GeneraLee> i do have a GC with viper
<IV20> u realize dvdr's are still the cheapest way to backup up data if u look at cost per gig
<GeneraLee> did not update the FW, still 1st release
<Marach> IV20: i do >:/
<Marach> unlike everyone else
<GeneraLee> IV20: yes that is if your system dvd can read them :)
<^Wulfgar^> so swap out the wii dvdrom
<Marach> i bought a used wii
<^Wulfgar^> cheaper than a wode
<GeneraLee> ok
<Marach> so it was a loterry
<Espeon> 6meow
<KarateBob> lol
<GeneraLee> but still the idea of reading isos is not bad
<Marach> lottery*
<Marach> which i won :3
<^Wulfgar^> GeneraLee, you realize that there IS a gc iso loader in the works, right?
<GeneraLee> no, i did not know
<GeneraLee> :)
<Marach> it won't run as fast
<GeneraLee> this will make a difference now
<^Wulfgar^> and you know this how?
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Ohai
<Marach> the disc one already has compatibility problems.
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Ohai
<^Wulfgar^> and?
<Espeon> 6meow
<Espeon> hiii
<^Wulfgar^> GeneraLee, why not just BUY the GC games you want to play...alot easier imo...and they WILL work on your current wii dvdrom
<DefiantN> why use a wode instead of a homebrew usb loader?
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14meow to you too
<Marach> DefiantN: gc
<DefiantN> oh, nevermind
<Marach> <GeneraLee> but they are not available
<^Wulfgar^> sure they are...never heard of ebay/craigslist?
<GeneraLee> ^Wulfgar^: im not in the US/EU :)
<^Wulfgar^> so you're in some bumbfuck country that doesn't even have ebay...
<GeneraLee> the temps here reached 51C the other day :)
<GeneraLee> lool
<Espeon> :3
<GeneraLee> the country is not that bad, but no ebay here :)
<Espeon> Makes me 100 times cuter instantly
<GeneraLee> i do have

<GeneraLee> and a UK address
<GeneraLee> they forward my orders to my local address

<chr0m> but it looks legit
<chr0m> has full operations guide, etc
<DefiantN> its taken them too long to release good game on vc
<chr0m> anyone know where this allstars wad came from?

<^Wulfgar^> it my not be that exact release, but it IS an injection
<[NiNjA]UK> 0rangechickn ftw
<chr0m> but yeah looks like they put all the instructions in the wad
<chr0m> from the single releases of each game
<chr0m> the screenshots from the other games are from the nes versions
<^Wulfgar^> as [NiNjA]UK said, 0rangechicken FTW
<chr0m> couldn't find that release on usenet
<chr0m> the one i found seems fine, very well done
<Blackwolf> hmm i should use that recipe
<Blackwolf> for orange chicken lol
<chr0m> heh
<chr0m> nice releases

<chr0m> this OC mario allstars doesn't have an operations guide

<yuyuyupo> yet people still don't go cause books R gay
<ultraman> ohh, you can check out wii games at the library?
<ultraman> didnt know that
<ultraman> lol
<Civic> Music as well
<Civic> @Ultraman: use usernet or torrent
<Civic> No need to pay for a service that should be free in the first place..
<ultraman> well, with the outbreak of the internet, i forgot all about the library
<Civic> I can see paying for videos but TV shows and what not - TJFR

<Aurora> it was good, but also kinda gross
<SheenaFox> ...Why half cooked?
<Aurora> because I thought it was fully cooked
<Aurora> but it wasn't

<Jerry-ipo> Hey Aurora, I"ve been watching soul eater recently, got till episode 10.it's awesome
<Aurora> good, only 42 more to go
<dupasugl> is the app in the correct place on the sd card?
<Jerry-ipo> yup. :D
<SheenaFox> Are you reading it at the same time?
<SheenaFox> D:
<Jerry-ipo> eh? reading? whaddaya mean?
<SheenaFox> Reading the manga
<Aurora> lol
<Jerry-ipo> nah. I don't really read mangas
<Aurora> reading the manga and watching the show would probably kill your brain
<Jerry-ipo> oh, I see.
<Brother|IRA> how many manga chapters are there anyway?
<Aurora> brother, it's still going
<Aurora> I'm not sure anymore
<Brother|IRA> :|
<SheenaFox> 76 and going
<Jerry-ipo> /me gives Aurora a Death The Kid
<Aurora> the anime has a completely different storyline after episode 25-ish
<SheenaFox> I'm waiting for it to update XD
<dupasugl> if i want to burn a wbfs file so i canplay on a older wii is tht possible?
<Brother|IRA> I would suspect
<Aurora> lol
<Aurora> I still haven't read it
<Brother|IRA> I wonder if it'll pass FMA with 110 chapters
<Aurora> I'm too attuned to the anime story to be interested in the manga story D:
<Brother|IRA> XD
<Jerry-ipo> lol. okays. and late hai Sheena
<Marach> why do people join the channel when they're going to be banne anyway?
<SheenaFox> hi
<Brother|IRA> same here Aurora but with FMA:B
<Marach> banned*
<^Wulfgar^> dupasugl, no
<Brother|IRA> or simply because the anime is almost over
<^Wulfgar^> you have to convert back to iso
<Jerry-ipo> yeah.Aurora is too addicted to Soul. "gives her a Soul"
<Brother|IRA> yep till on 63
*Aurora explodes
<SheenaFox> hi Michel
<Brother|IRA> the only villain that seems to be good is Medusa
<Michel> hi hi :)
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04Hi
*Michel glomps Rocket_Ninetales :)
<Quilava> hi Michel
<Michel> hai quil :)
<Jerry-ipo> lol. Death the kid is now officially my fav character in soul eater. I find his obsession with symmtery funny :D
<Quilava> whats up?
<Michel> nothing special
<Jerry-ipo> OMG... haaaaaaai Michel?
<Michel> just started a game - wanna play some after that? :)
<Quilava> sure, it'll give me a little time to wake up <.>
<Michel> hai jerry? :P
<dupasugl> okay i just want to make sure that it is possible
<Michel> whuts that OMG for? :P
<Brother|IRA> Jerry: he's better as a xingese prince :P
<Jerry-ipo> 'glomp huggles michel" :D
<Michel> haha
<^Wulfgar^> use wii backup manager to convert wbfs back to iso
<dupasugl> i use backup manager i dont think u do thoug wlugar
<Brother|IRA> if only because of the arvarice
<Michel> i finally picked my next champion: pantheon :P
<Jerry-ipo> lol,why Brother?
<Quilava> D:
<dupasugl> oh okay cool
<Aurora> sorry, but Medusa is the most awesome villain ever
<Michel> will be much easier to win with that one, when i finally can play him right
<Quilava> but.. he's ANNOYING
<^Wulfgar^> of course I use wii backup manager
<Brother|IRA> Because, he's Greed as the xingese prince XD
<Aurora> even though she has some weird motives in the anime
<Michel> but nidalee is more of a supporter then a gamewinner :P
<Michel> jepp
<Brother|IRA> Aurora: Father can beat her :P
<dupasugl> i thought u used wbfs something
<Jerry-ipo> it was for fun? :P to Michel
<Michel> and i plan to be more annoying that you ever saw him yet :P
<Michel> ah :)
<dupasugl> it auto scrubs them so i didnt know if that messed it up if i wanted to burn it
<dupasugl> cause it started out as a 4.7gb iso
<Jerry-ipo> Medusa is just plain creepy...
<Brother|IRA> if only he literally becomes God at episode 61
<Brother|IRA> which was the most epic moment in the series
<Michel> *then
<Quilava> <.>
<^Wulfgar^> and watch what wii backup manager makes it ;)
<Jerry-ipo> Brother becoming God was the most epic moment in the series
<Jerry-ipo> "is shot" XD
<Brother|IRA> then that would mean I killed 50 million people o.o
<dupasugl> id ont need to do it right now but its good to know that
<dupasugl> because on my external i have all the iso's still
<Jerry-ipo> XD. just kidding
<Brother|IRA> :p
<dupasugl> iso's and wbfs files of the same game
<Jerry-ipo> blah. gotta go. needs sleep.later guys! :D
<Jerry-ipo> seeya

<Andres> Hello, Curly :o
<Andres> Slept well?
<Aeroslash> and sunshine?
<Curly> kinda
<May> IMAGINATION
<May> IS THE BEST
<Aeroslash> :D
<Aeroslash> Indeed!
<Curly> the thing that woke me up was kind of unpleasant >.>
<Andres> :(
*Andres huggles!
<ficarra10> Mplayer ce plays iso?
*Curly hugs
<Muzer> doubt it - it might do, though
<Muzer> presumably that's an ISO of a DVD
<ficarra10> yeah
<Breeze> what wokes you up?
*Breeze pounces Stitch
*Stitch hugs ^^
*Breeze huggles
<Muzer> well, there's only one way to find out
<Muzer> try it and see
<Breeze> omg.. the piece of bacon i was eatting just fell in my parfait.. which has whipped topping on the top which is where the bacon landed and it still tasted so yummy when i ate it!
<Stitch> Well, obviously.
<Stitch> It IS bacon.
<May> flowers make the best gift to a loved one apparently even if they do die eventually and wilt and start to stink and rot
<Stitch> Bacon is good with anything.
<Breeze> *nods*
<ficarra10> Does Mplayer need any cIOS?
<llrcombs> not afaik
<llrcombs> but please read the !rules, you're a bit tentative...
<Muzer> for USB2.0 I think it might, not sure though
<Aurora> go with chocolate
<Aurora> it makes everyone better
<May> 2 Aurora 36410 "after like 6, he told me they were dog biscuits" <-- you ate dog biscuits?
<May> chocolate yum
<ficarra10> Oh I forgot, mplayer isn't allowed here >>
<llrcombs> yeah, I believe that's what IOS202 is for
<Muzer> um
<Muzer> no
<llrcombs> mplayer is fine
<Aurora> lol yeah i DID
<ficarra10> So worried against breaking rules
<Muzer> cIOS isn't allowed here sometimes, depending on its use
<Aurora> caps dfjknkdgr
<Muzer> lol
<llrcombs> it's cIOS that's the issue
<Muzer> in any case, it will still be playable (if very slow/stuttery) with USB1.1, so you'll be able to find out without it
<llrcombs> we try to avoid it in most cases
<llrcombs> but for MPlayer on 202, you're fine
<May> smae problem
<May> I blame Vista
<Muzer> if it plays but very slowly, you'll need to find a way of enabling USB2.0. If it doesn't play at all, it won't work whether you have it or not, so don't bother.
<ficarra10> Isn't HBC in the first place breaking the rules anyway? why worry about piracy if you already broke rules?
<May> lol
<Muzer> um
<Muzer> in what way is HBC "breaking the rules"?
<May> were they good? because I've tried dry dog kibble and it tastes dry
<May> there's no flavor
<ficarra10> Dosnt it go against some TOS or something like that?
<ficarra10> IF its legit, why does nintendo try so hard to break it?
<rippy> anyone know how to get and put boxart for the games on usbloader w/o having to download them manually through the usbloader?
<Muzer> It's not legit, but it's also not illegal (in most countries)
<Muzer> I'm pretty certain it's legal in the country in which this channel was founded (UK), so that's all that matters
<rippy> that shit takes so long, was wondering if i could just download them and toss em on the sd card
<hunterm> :o what now
<Muzer> legit = Nintendo like it, in this case
<Obsi> Hiya!
<Ben64> hbc is too legit
<May> hi Obsi
<hunterm> yes
<Muzer> Ben64: legit = Nintendo like it, was my definition I made up :P
<Muzer> Nintendo don't like it
<hunterm> i wonder why everyone keeps thinking that hbc is illigal.
*Kipi hugs Obsi & May
<Aeroslash> wb Kipi
<Ben64> nintendo doesn't like lots of things :)
<Muzer> lol
<Kipi> Hullo, Oreo.
<Ben64> hunterm: because it breaks TOS, which means nothing
*May ish hugged and huggles back
<Aeroslash> :O Oreo
<Muzer> TBH, I'm not sure whether it's legal in the US or not, DMCA and all that
*Obsi hugs Kipi
<Obsi> Oreo?
<Aeroslash> tis what Kipi calls me
<hunterm> lol
<Aeroslash> Oreoslash
<Muzer> isn't there something against reverse-engineering or something?
<Ben64> pretty sure it is legal in US
<Aeroslash> because I love oreos
<hunterm> yes
<hunterm> TOS is pretty much a warrenty
<Ben64> in order to break piracy, yes
<hunterm> which has been broken by installing it
<Muzer> glad I don't live there then, lol :P
<Ben64> but i don't think hbc has that intention :)
*May gives you a basket full
<Kipi> XP Because he said, "Call me Oreoslash", and I was the only one who did
<May> smugleaf <3
*Kipi snuggles May
<Aurora> mAY
<Aurora> *May
<May> ya
<Aurora> the dog biscuits I ate were basically chocolate chip cookies
<Aurora> I didn't realize i was eating biscuits until I was told
<May> ...dog biscuits with chocolate?
<May> that's kind of odd
<Aurora> well, it wasn't chocolate
<Aurora> obviously
<Aurora> but it tasted like it
<May> that's really weird
<May> I didn't think that was possible to imitate chocolate chips
<May> oh look new pokemanz

*Espeon now belongs to Skylands for 10 minutes
<Sneas> 03:3!
<Sneas> 03And hi xD
<Guest88902> que son muy grandes en verdad!
<May> I'm officially scared of this guy
*Michel cuddles Skylands Espeon :P
<Skylands> 10?
<TimeShift> the guy's living in Woonsocket
<Espeon> xD
<Skylands> 10I am not an Espeon D:
<TimeShift> odd place for odd person
<Espeon> She isn't, but I belong to you right now. That's what he meant
<Espeon> I wouldn't complain if you were thou- hi
<Skylands> 10:O
<TimeShift> dunno if I shall approve him. Need to talk to Arti first
<Aristeo> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxWskedKAVU :3
<May> does Arti even know this guy personally? owo
<Espeon> You're fine just as you are, shush.
<TimeShift> nope
<TimeShift> that's what makes everything kinda creepy
<May> wow, now that love at first sight I guess
<Skylands> 10Breefloof > Espfloof
<Espeon> There's not really much floof on Espeons
<Espeon> apart from the cheeks, but we know this already
<Skylands> 10which is why my above statement holds thruth
<Skylands> 10truth*
<Sneas> 03TKfloof
*Sneas runs
<Skylands> 10No.
<TimeShift> http://glaceonisshadow.deviantart.com/art/Anthro-Lugia-170040375
<TimeShift> am I a bit too harsh?^^
<Sneas> 03also
*Sneas tries jailbreaking his extra iPod Touch
<May> nope
<May> that's stolen art
<May> I was just surprised by the size of it
<Sneas> 03holy crap sweet
<Sneas> 03It worked
<Aurora> LOOOOOOL
<Aurora> ok
<Aurora> TimeShift, go back to that xai pi
<Aurora> c
<Aurora> pic
<Espeon> o.o
*Espeon stays to floofthings
<Espeon> !umbreons
<TimeShift> just read it
<Sneas> 03oh
<Sneas> 03oops :3
<Espeon> the blur and size semi-gives it away on its own
<Sneas> 03Did the wrong one
<Arrow> (Hawkie leans in the wrong direction as the bus turns, and ends up almost falling off)
<Arrow> Arrow: You need to lean in this direction when the bus turns that way. Remember what I said about centre of gravity?
<Arrow> Hawkie: It's just...different!
<TimeShift> and the idea about combining my new zippo with zippo lighting fuel and a stars&stripes + a fake Ho-oh-plush is getting more and more attractive....
<Aurora> 6wtf arrow lol
<Espeon> o-O
<SheenaFox> O_o
<May> random pop in and out
<TimeShift> do you think he'll like if I'll set his avatar on the forum to this? http://www.n24.de/media/_fotos/1politik/2008_2/mrz_2/080320/bgproteste/17.jpg ^^
<TimeShift> or that? http://static.rp-online.de/layout/showbilder/11854-ap-101050_WILLIAMS_EXECUTION_CAJC113.jpg
<Kipi> Use tinyurl.com
<TimeShift> too lame to copy&paste?^^
<May> LOL
<Kipi> Where would I paste it?
<May> it's rude, but the second made me laugh the most
<Aurora> 6TimeShift, as much as I think his behavior is uncalled for, yours is just as bad if you do the same
<Kipi> I can't drag something out of my DS to an invisible computer
<TimeShift> some fires are fought the best with fire :P
<Aurora> 6fine do it
<Aurora> 6it'll probably just add to the fire with other nationalists in our site
<Aurora> 6and then those who hate the us
<Aurora> 6and well, we wind up in yet another arguement
<Aurora> 6shall we go into the BLEURGHERURGHGH
<Kipi> I say do it, but only cuz that's not what Roara wants.
<Kipi> 'w'
<May> TimeShift, she is right. We don't want another World War breaking out over the insane guy
<Aurora> 6I couldn't care less about the war, but I'm saying that because it's my job
<SpooKy> im sad
<TimeShift> wow....a world war due to a burning piece of cloth. I'm impressed
<Aurora> 6I personally don't respect it
<SpooKy> wasted 2 days to watch this show
<SpooKy> n it has a sucky ending
<SpooKy> :@
<Aurora> 6...
<Aurora> 6well, the cloth is one thing
<Aurora> 6changing his avatar to fit your personal amusement is actually sick
<Aurora> 6considering the picture's topic
<TimeShift> it's not sick, that's what you call sarcasm or black humor :)
<Aurora> 6...
<May> huh, I like my OCs ^w^
<Aurora> 6why are you an Admin at this site, TimeShift?
<Aurora> 6this isn't the first I've wondered this question, to be completely honest
<TimeShift> because I enjoy to help the community, know quite well about the tech-stuff and am very dedicated to Lugia
<Aurora> 6ok
<Aurora> 6so changing that avatar to something like that is helping the community?
<Aurora> 6quite a different definition, if you ask me
<Espeon> guys..
<Aurora> 6what
<TimeShift> looks like I met a dark spot of yours :P
<May> not the right place?
<Espeon> just
<Espeon> no
<Espeon> :3
<Aurora> 6looks like i've met a dark spot of yours
<May> >w>;
<Runix> AFK
<Runix> playing LoL
<Aurora> 6stupidest line I've heard
<Aurora> 6but whatever
<TimeShift> not really, because I'm smiling about how ffffffffffffffff you go because of a mentioned idea of mine regarding a piece of cloth
<TimeShift> even less: A picture of a piece of cloth
<Aurora> 6actually you know what
<Aurora> 6I'll respect the other people in this chat
<Runix> -rolls eyes-
<Sina3> hello
<Aurora> 6I'm not doing this
<Espeon> Really, there is no reason for this to be done in a "public" setting like in this channel tbh
*May must actually go real soon just because she wants to work on the devolpment of her oc's
<May> ...well
<Espeon> loplwut
<Skylands> 10Can people not get along anymore :/
<May> it IS insulting, but what do you think Arti would think? she wants the site to remain peaceful
<May> we don't want a fight over a flag and someone being a nationalist
*Kyu facepaws
*Kipi belches
<TimeShift> well, that's the kind of answer I waited for tbh
<Espeon> I mean hell I sure dislike overly patriotic people along with overly religious people but that doesn't mean it would be right to godmod their avatar or something. But tl;dr obsolete discussion is obsolete
<Espeon> in my opinion
<Espeon> anyway
<May> possible new pokemon, news on serebii
<May> just restating what I said earlier
<Espeon> great, more reasons to facepalm
*Espeon hides
<May> xD
<May> I just dislike the green broccoli head
<Skylands> 10The green unconfirmed thing is ugly
*May nods
<May> therefore if I catch one, I will name it Broccoli
<Skylands> 10I think the brown one is the pre-evolution of Ononokusu
<Espeon> I just hope they for once pre-release uncovers all the bad ones. I mean all generations has bad Pokeymans so I just hope...
<May> and yay for more werepokemon
<Skylands> 10May, have you seen the other green bear thing?
<Kipi> :3
<May> ew
<May> I hate it
<Skylands> 10I think the unconfirmed green one might be realted to it, dontcha think?
<Skylands> 10related*
<May> maybe
<May> but we just have to wait and then seen how wrong we are or how right we could've been?
<Kipi> X3
<Stitch> That's a lot of joining and quitting.
<Growlithe> !floof
*Skylands flooooooooofs all over Growlithe "Bow down to my floofiness!"
<May> http://nkognz.deviantart.com/art/Zoroark-the-gerudo-fox-154520510

<Espeon> DAMNIT
<Espeon> or well, many people
*Aeroslash blinks
<Aeroslash> I have not a clue what you are talking about
<May> search up "smugleaf" and roarart is on the front page
<Espeon> hawt
<Espeon> because It's a growlithe
<Espeon> Smugleaf is like the best nickname for a pokemon ever.
<May> yup
<Espeon> it's so fitting
<May> but I bet Roara's going to get one and name it Excalibur
<Andres> And I suppose it ain't very long D:
<Kipi> I'd rather die than have that name
*Skylands evolves the Growlithe with a Fire Stone
<Skylands> 10Extraordinary floof
<Skylands> 101<May> but I bet Roara's going to get one and name it Excalibur 10<- I thought of that before her XD
<SheenaFox> Just to let you guys know
<SheenaFox> Mah legend begins in the 12th century :|
<May> you did?
<Skylands> 10Smugleaf's begins in the 5 generation :O
<Skylands> 105th*
<May> Smugleaf is epic
<May> http://browse.deviantart.com/?q=smugleaf&order=9&offset=48#/d2pz4ej
<May> copy much?
<Espeon> yesjpg
<Skylands> 10What do you mean?
<Michel> good night everyone :)
<TimeShift> hrm, I think Roara deserves an excuse for the little game I played with her^^
<Espeon> niiiight
<May> must be done and has been done
<May> says in the comment
*Kipi fluffs TimeShift
<Kipi> 'w'
<TimeShift> huh?
<Kipi> Nothin'~
<Stitch> But wait.
<Stitch> How can you change your nick when you quit?
<Aristeo> You join under a different name, of course!
<Stitch> Aha.
<Andres> Probably! :o
<Stitch> Lemme try.
<Andres> I should sing it!
<Stitch> CURSED REMOTE SCRIPT
<Andres> Silly :o
<Andres> It works like this!
<May> http://browse.deviantart.com/?q=smugleaf&order=9&offset=96#/d2sog3w
<May> now that's a sad sight
<May> but it's pretty funny
<Stitch> o.o
<Andres> Or not..
<Andres> Should have properly closed the connection.
<Stitch> That's how it's done.
<Espeon> lol I totally didn't expect THAT
<Kipi> Expect the unexpected
<SheenaFox> ...LOL
<Andres> You still look like a Stitch D:
*Stitch points to his quit message.
<May> late SheenaFox
<Andres> Oh, that is an idea!
<Espeon> it would be much better with more smug though
<Espeon> really, right there it would even fit
<May> XD
<Espeon> i feel like this guy won the internet arguement when he told me to climb a wall of dicks. there's no comeback that tops that
<GunInHand> !list
<Skylands> 10whut
<Espeon> I could tell him to cook a bag of them but... eh
<Espeon> I mean espe espeon
*Skylands is starting to like Wotter now because of it's evolution
<Espeon> lol wotter
<Espeon> I don't mind any of them really but I still don't really like "wotter"
<Skylands> 10Pokabu is the only starter without a nickname o3o
<May> Later everyone
<Kipi> :3
<Espeon> everyone <3 smugleaf and in general </3 wotter, Pokabu is in the middle
<Espeon> that's why
<Espeon> I don't mind any of them more than the others
<Espeon> :3
*Curly rolls in
<Kipi> X3 I'm winning.
*Proto puts a ramp in front of Curly
<Espeon> You guys know what I love? When I almost post a link in the totally wrong channel but notices it before it's too late.
<Espeon> Yeah.
*Curly flies off of it and goes into orbit
<Kipi> Ew
<Espeon> And how are you winning?
<Kipi> It was probably porn from WC
*Kipi flees!
<Espeon> I'd love to play a file of Francis saying "nnnnnope" right now because you sir Kipi are wrong.
*Aristeo reaches up to catch Curly!
<Aristeo> \o/ <--- reaching up
*Stitch intercepts curly
*Andres hugtackles the Curly and brings her back down to teh Earthstuffs D:
<Andres> Everyone wants to save teh Curly!
<Curly> o.o

*Kipi flees more
*Curly is intercepted by a small mob of people and falls back to earth
*Stitch is going to go look for Pokemon Pictionary on iScribble.
*DarkTruth steals Curly away to her home planet
<Espeon> xD for once it was actually not THAT sort of "not suitable"
<Curly> :O
<DarkTruth> :3
<Aristeo> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh8mRjO1nhg <--- I'm so addicted to this meh song
<Espeon> Just "completely unrelated to everything here" really.

<Curly> his room is always super warm and I don't know how he can stand it >_>
*Aristeo performs emergency surgery on DarkTruth's battery :3
*Proto grimaces as battery acid sprays everywhere
<Aristeo> Nurse, I need 20 CCs of triaxoline! D:
<Proto> >_>
<DarkTruth> my laptop was not fully charged when I grabbed it

<Proto> HOVERBOARD
<Skylands> 10Hi
*Espeon sits on Glacymr
<Glacymr> 12oww
<Espeon> You should be able to take that
<Kipi> He owwed at your smell.
<Kipi> Which is a lie
<Kipi> Cuz he doesn't have a sense of smell
*Kipi sits on Glacymr's nose
<Glacymr> 12oww
<Espeon> that is rather confusing
<Espeon> just like Feather
<Feather> 10o-o
<Kipi> That's what she said
<Espeon> ba-dum-tsch
<Kipi> By she I meant he
<Kipi> Cuz Espeon just said that
<Kipi> A few seconds ago
<Kipi> And I mean he literally said that word-for-word in the exact same tone and voice
<Sneas> 03wtf

<Kipi> :3
<Brother> so what did I miss?
<Aeroslash> nothin much
<Glacymr> 12o-o
<Kipi> Espeon said a joke and I stated he said it.
<Brother> wat @ nationalists
<Kipi> Whoa
<Kipi> Whoa, bro.
<Kipi> Bro... don't do it
<Espeon> ruh roh
<Brother> oh noes they turned Espeon into marketing material D:
<Espeon> really, anyone taking something too far be it patriotism, religion or an obsession is doing it wrong /random
*Espeon hideflailwiggles
<Kipi> Foooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...*huff-puff* Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood!!!
*Brother gives kipi good
<Kipi> brb
<Brother> *food
<Brother> Almost gave him money
<Kipi> Money is food
<Brother> only if you like paper
<Kipi> No
<Espeon> in a way money is food. but only in a way
<Kipi> I'm an herbivore, and money is the root of all evil.
<Brother> So kipi
<Brother> is the tree of all evil
<Espeon> o3o
<Brother> Espeon: depends on the situation but dont make me use my brain
<Espeon> Brother your logic is irrefutable
<Kipi> Therefore, money, as roots, is edible as a plant to herbivors
<Brother> Espeon: if only for a day
<Kipi> Brother, that's dumb.
<Kipi> I eat the roots.
<Kipi> I'm not the tree
<Kipi> Why would you say something so silly?
<Espeon> so you're the roots?
<Brother> o3o
<Brother> no Espeon he eats evil
<Brother> therefore he is
<Kipi> Yush.
<MrDopeman> do any games besides sports resort support wiimotion plus ?
<Brother> So we do what reasonable people do
<MrDopeman> im thinking about selling resort inc the motion plus
<Evil0ne> most newer ones do
<Brother> start a hunt of all the boxes in the world
<Evil0ne> red steel2 u cant play w/o it
<Espeon> I honestly don't even.
<Kipi> You'd be stooping to my level to become the exact thing I was
<lukegb> MuzerNtbk: nuu
<MuzerNtbk> ?
<Kipi> Then you'd be hunted
<MrDopeman> any other games that REQUIRE it
<MrDopeman> `?
<|Omega|> ?
<Espeon> I love when youtube trolls call me illiterate when they fail to spell "you're" when they call me <censored>.
<lukegb> MuzerNtbk: anyhoos, back to wut I was saying several hours ago
<Brother> So then we get put in a crappy predator remake?
<MuzerNtbk> :/
<Kipi> Now I hop away for noms
<MuzerNtbk> confused
<lukegb> My bots aren't opped because the less opped bots, the better, if they're not botnetted.
<WetBunnyfox> Wet, cuz I'ma shower afterwards. <.<
<MuzerNtbk> right
<MuzerNtbk> lol
<Espeon> floofy
<MuzerNtbk> also, fewer :P
<Evil0ne> google it?
<lukegb> Yeah
<Presea> lol
*Evil0ne isnt a wii db ya know
<lukegb> I wrote fewer, then changed it to less
<lukegb> Then changed something else
<Blackwolf> new zelda requires it
<MuzerNtbk> lol
<wop> i see
<Espeon> without the internet irony wouldn't be the same
<tpw_rules> <Lunchbox> The day Microsoft makes a product that doesn't suck is the day they make a vacuum cleaner.
<lukegb> MuzerNtbk: also, NUSD works fine on Mono for Windows. Since I can only build on Win, not Lin, it's hard to test.
<lukegb> tpw_rules: the day the iPad is good is the day no other tablets are left on this planet
<tpw_rules> >_>
<lukegb> Hehe, jokes.
<MuzerNtbk> lukegb, agreed!
<MuzerNtbk> The iPad sucks miserably :P
*tpw_rules likes his ipad!
<tpw_rules> why's it suck?
<tpw_rules> and what's better?
<lukegb> App Store.
<lukegb> Both the EU and the US agree on that point :P
<MuzerNtbk> my netbook :P
*Curly is now on Shaymin :O
<Curly> although now I'm on port 6667 :I
<|Omega|> Ubuntu Software Center!
<Curly> how do you connect to a specific port with the /server command? >.>
<|Omega|> I did some reading on it today.
<|Omega|> Awesome.
<|Omega|> Actually, yesterday.
<tpw_rules> lol
<tpw_rules> what reading?
<jasperdett> type /server servernam port
<Glacymr> 12oh no someone made WetBunnyfox wet

<Sneas> holy <censored>
<Brother> so whats up Espeon o3o
<Sneas> 03I'm playing Pokemon Crystal on my iPod
<lukegb> |Omega|: you mean that apt wrapper thing?
<|Omega|> Yeah.
<|Omega|> It really is becoming great.
<|Omega|> And I prefer apt-get myself.
<MuzerNtbk> I just use aptitude
*Andres was hoping to tackle a hug onto it >:/
<|Omega|> (Used to prefer apt-get)
*Andres is bored.
<lukegb> Then again, it's going to start selling software soon
<Presea> that's nothin
<tpw_rules> really?
<Presea> i've been playing pkmn glod on my 2004 pda for awhile
<Presea> ;p
<|Omega|> Mhm, I think that's a good thing though.
<Presea> gold*
<tpw_rules> i sometimes use apt-get
<Andrew> hiiiiiii
<|Omega|> If people want to sell their software, they should be able to.
<lukegb> I use aptitude (commandline only, no gui, not even curses)/yum
*Miyuki sighs
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14And I've been playing Pokemon Red on my mobile phone so :P
<|Omega|> And providing them the means to do it is good.
<Brother> ohai
<tpw_rules> aptitude is curses :P
<Sneas> 03XD
<|Omega|> yeah :P
<Sneas> 03Now to find a GBA emulator that is free
<lukegb> |Omega|: well yeah, LinDVD :P
<Presea> there are plenty
<tpw_rules> but it annoys me because it's just raw packages
<Sneas> 03Only one I see is $4.99
<Andres> Hai, Miyuki :o
<Presea> no
<Presea> i see them as free
<Sneas> 03(for ipod touch)
<tpw_rules> i like the software center cause i can install full apps and stuff
<lukegb> tpw_rules: aptitude install blah
<Presea> even if you have to pay
<Miyuki> hi..
<|Omega|> lukegb: Try it.
<Sneas> 03?
<Presea> well think of it this way
<Andres> How is the Miyuki? :o
<Presea> you can't sell something that is similar to something copyrighted
<lukegb> |Omega|: only Debian box is a graphicalless VPS
<Presea> legally
<Presea> so
<Sneas> 03It says Purchase $4.99
<Sneas> 03o.o
<Presea> why not just grab a cracked version of one of those
<Presea> for free
<lukegb> tpw_rules: aptitude search blah
<|Omega|> Ah, then I see a reason for not using it :P
<Presea> since it's really illegal either way
<Presea> one way you just pay
<Sneas> 03dunno how XD
<Presea> one sec
<tpw_rules> it depends on what i'm installing whether i'll use software center or apt-get
<Sneas> 03Kinda the only one I see
<|Shadow|> MrDopeman, YEA JUST SELL IT
<|Shadow|> U BE BETTER OFF
<|Shadow|> oops caps
<Sneas> 03Only one I see is gpSPhone
<|Shadow|> u dont need it
<|Shadow|> u can deal without it man
<Miyuki> depressed
<|Omega|> tpw_rules: You're on Ubuntu?
<tpw_rules> not now
<tpw_rules> i am sometimes
<Miyuki> hows is Andres?
<lukegb> |Omega|: since I use arch on my main pc... :P
<tpw_rules> when i get a new graphics card for my desktop, i'm gonna install 10.04 and win7

<heater> no, u are on a channel that has ppl with common sense
<TimeShift> any comments?^^
<heater> wtf would try and use a flash drive?
<MrDopeman> wait til |Shadow| tells u how stupid u are
<Lambda> yeah, the walkthrough would be the most helpful but that takes away from the experience
<tpw_rules> no
<Infamouz> then theres crap that happens in the house... oi...
<tooth4> why?
<Lambda> ah, family issues...
<MrDopeman> he never said he want to use a flash drive

<Glacymr> 12hnmm
<MrDopeman> tooth4 did ur wii play burned games before ?
<tooth4> no ive been trying it to do so
<Infamouz> its a long thick wire that has sort of a fork at the end that spins and its ment for the drain under your house to eat up the roots cloging the drain
*WetBunnyfox sits on Glacymr's nose.
<Glacymr> 12eep
<Lambda> ah I see
<Glacymr> 12i'm not a chair
<Infamouz> you feed it up under the house and it eats up the roots cloging the drain
<Lambda> I don't think we've got one of those
<WetBunnyfox> Your nose is
<MrDopeman> then u have a new wii that cant read burned discs most likely
<Glacymr> 12heh
<WetBunnyfox> Just like SheenaFox
<SheenaFox> :O
<SheenaFox> True.
<WetBunnyfox> But not quite as comfy
<Infamouz> anyway the dam thing was tangled in its bundle and i had to manage feeding it and untangling it for 2 hours
<MrDopeman> u will either have to usa a usbhdd or a usbdvd drive
<tooth4> no its the old origional wii for sure
<heater> did he even try and mod it yet?
<Infamouz> and i managed to get blisters all over my hands even though i was wearing gloves
<Lambda> did you have to go under the house to do it?
<tooth4> yeah its modded

<MrDopeman> softmod?
<tooth4> ive been trying to get it to work for days
<tooth4> yeah
<WetBunnyfox> But it's too hot to sit on a floofy SheenaCouch
<Infamouz> nah the drain was in front of the front yard
<Infamouz> had to go through that way
<MrDopeman> u modded it urself ?
<tooth4> its softmodded and yes i did it myself
<WetBunnyfox> Where's TST Bot? :<
<Lambda> ah
<|Shadow|> <dunnie> is it possible to downgrade a wii from 4.3 to 4.2? 4.1 yes
<Infamouz> never really got it drained either cause of the tangled mess and my blistered hands
<MrDopeman> what fw version did it have ?
<|Shadow|> tooth4, your a supid shit
<MrDopeman> originally
<Andres> "Ha! I'll turn you inside out, since I have not done that to anyone for a very long time!" *SKLURCH* "Oh, yes. That's why. Sorry about your clothes."

<tpw_rules> no
<lukegb> There's more than just that *sigh*

<Brother|IRA> Aurora: you should watch a movie
<KyroTheMozilla> ello Sky
<Brother|IRA> at least you have an excuse to waste the day then :p
<Aurora> even worse

<Articuno> 12No comments other than lets see how it goes TimeShift, if he starts acting weird, I'll have to sort it out but he hasn';t posted anything yet
<Lambda> :O
<Aristeo> Maybe you can make the file ircd.log :3
<Aristeo> Then it can find it \o/
<Lambda> That's a good movie too
*Skylands wonders why Kyro always says hi to her as soon as he comes in
<Skylands> 10lol
<Infamouz> yeah
<Infamouz> i'm supprised cause its fairly new as well
<Brother|IRA> maybe watch the disney classics aurora?
<jasperdett> i did
<TimeShift> no wonder, I've just activated his account about two hours ago :P
<Damos> 13PONYO!
<TimeShift> and he didn't login or try to since then
<Espeon> http://i50.tinypic.com/30c90zc.jpg I am proud
<Lambda> I've seen a lot of this year's movies and the best ones were HTTYD and Toy Story 3
<Articuno> 12Oh lol
<Infamouz> i havent seen toy story
<Lambda> I very nearly teared up a bit
<Infamouz> i dont watch too many movies anymore
*KyroTheMozilla shrugs t
<Damos> 13oh hey Arti
<KyroTheMozilla> ~.~ must go now, is in trouble
<Infamouz> i only watched httyd cause the night fury intrigued me
<Aurora> meh
<Espeon> We all <3 you Sky, that's why :3
<Espeon> good luck Kyro :3
<TimeShift> wish SMF had a function like the FAF do. Admins and Mods can give users warning points there. If a user has too many of them, all his postings require moderation - saying a Mod needs to read over the comments BEFORE they're either activated or deleted
<jasperdett> Aristeo i did that and still get the same error
<Lambda> the night fury was awesome
<Infamouz> the only movie that stands out in my mind that i really liked was the dark knight
<Espeon> lol warn system
<Aurora> 6...why are we talking like he's already cause a lot of trouble on the site
<Skylands> 10:P
<Aurora> 6*caused
<Damos> 13who?
<Lambda> yeah, it was pretty good
<Brother|IRA> Espeon: that reminds me of the reputation system
<TimeShift> just throwing in ideas. Not that any of those things was required until now...except for one or two incidents in almost five years
<Espeon> it's true
<TimeShift> yet still I'm a feature-lover :)
<Infamouz> but there were several others that i wanted to see but never really got up to see them
<Aristeo> Aww
<Infamouz> speaking of which... another movie rental place is going out of business here in town
<Damos> 13and now our feature presentation
<TimeShift> and, like most here, a bit random :P
<Aristeo> Yeah, InspIRCd has some problems
<Andres> Maybe you could give it a hug and then it would work!
<Lambda> oh really?
<Espeon> lol rep system
<Infamouz> i'm supprised cause it was the only competition to block buster
<Damos> 13X3
<Skylands> 10:3
<TimeShift> I believe SMF does have something like that. It's called "Karma"-system
<Lambda> Family Video is the best
<Sina3> hi guys
<Sina3> i have CFG
<Brother|IRA> arg...this reminds me of revleft now >>
<Espeon> I've seen that on quite a few sites. Silly name for it though

*Andres builds a very dangerous fountain out of sausages, while running naked in the woods while trying to claw at the moon.

<Soyuz> o3o

<Lambda> which happens to not be a very cold temperature
<Lambda> mine is always too
<Damos> 13hey Skyland

<Lambda> And welcome to Walmart!
<Infamouz> how may i take your order
<Stormy> fire the current management and replace them with people who know what they're doing
<Infamouz> i'm feeling like arbies

<Infamouz> 2 people sitting on their ass doesn't seem to make up for just the one
<Infamouz> anyway whaz up stormy
<Stormy> Hm
<Stormy> Well
<Stormy> Other than being annoyed at Walmart management for making me repeat tasks and then undo them
<Stormy> The roof was leaking today
<Lambda> :O

<Lambda> At Walmart?
<Andres> Silly modem-
<Stormy> yeah
<Andres> Actually shut itself down.
<Stormy> and they couldn't do anything about it because construction has the day off
<Lambda> I sure hope someone put a bucket out there
<Lambda> :P
<Lambda> Oh
<Infamouz> air conditinoing unit and pipes tend to leak around here but they dont do a thing to them
<Stormy> So they just put buckets under it
<Lambda> Our Walmart has a leaky roof and all we do is the buckets as well
<Lambda> I know where all the leaky spots are too because it was my job to put the buckets there
<Infamouz> well at least your walmart wasnt notorious for having birds in it
<Lambda> ours had a bat recently
<Lambda> brb, time to eat
<Infamouz> i think mine was on the news once to try to take a shot at it for having bird waste around a long time ago
<Lambda|Eating> XD
<Infamouz> would have shut the store down too but they addressed it pretty quickly
<Infamouz> anyway... you have a decent 4th stormy?

<Prince-dari> Trumps is where all the cards are dealt out between the players, ace is high, one player chooses the trump suit, which wins over other suits. Goal is to win as many hands as possible, you must play the same suit as the first card played in a hand, if you can, if not you can play whatever you want, if you play a the highest trump card in the hand, you win.
<Evil0ne> he hates u
<Evil0ne> but its not personall
<Evil0ne> its just he doesnt like u :) haha
<Infamouz> so yeah basically eucher
<Prince-dari> I dunno what eucher is, must be a different name for the same game.
<Prince-dari> Oh, and you can play in teams if you want.
<Lambda|Eating> back
<Prince-dari> Shit head is kind of like uno.
<Prince-dari> Some numbers do certain things.
<Infamouz> only eucher cuts the deck in half 9-A and its rank is strait up except for the trump in which the jacks of the same color are the highest trump
<Infamouz> ah
<Prince-dari> Well, each person starts with 7 cards, and three face down cards, with three face up cards on top of them.
<Lambda|Eating> lol, the only card games I can play are go fish and uno
<Sina3> haha
<Prince-dari> Oh, I like go fish.
<Sina3> im deffinately a n00b
<Infamouz> i never played uno
<Infamouz> eucher is fun though
<Evil0ne> hehe
<Evil0ne> me 2
<Evil0ne> dont feel bad
<Infamouz> so is spoons when you got a good crowd going on
<Evil0ne> every1 cant b a expert
<Prince-dari> You have to play a card the same as, or higher than the previous card (unless circumstances brought about by special cards change it).
<Infamouz> that way you can litterally get your ass kicked
<Evil0ne> some people have more time to devote to it then others
<Prince-dari> Oh, I forgot cheat as well.
<Sina3> haha
<Infamouz> is stormy a neat freak lambda?
<Sina3> im more of a user
<Sina3> and not at all
<Stormy> Lol
<Sina3> a developer
<Lambda|Eating> Not really
<Lambda|Eating> :P
<Civic> its not due to time its due to users knowing how to use a search engine
<Infamouz> ah
<Stormy> not at all
<Prince-dari> Does Stormy take out your internet and phone lines?
<Infamouz> i was storta getting that vib a little
<Infamouz> stormy pirates what little internetz lambda has
<Lambda|Eating> Her parents are but she is not
<Infamouz> her parents are nazis!
<tpw_rules> baq
<Lambda|Eating> lol
<Lambda|Eating> [17:56] <&Stormy> yeah, he works at Culvers
<Lambda|Eating> [17:56] <+Infamouz> never heard of it
<Lambda|Eating> :O
<Infamouz> brb my arby sences are tingling
<Lambda|Eating> Never heard of Culver's!?
<Infamouz> nope
<Prince-dari> Nor have I, but I live in the UK.
<Civic> I can fully understand why Shadow states the statements he does here!.. Theres one thing to help users however everyone needs to do some research on there own..
<Stormy> I think it's a midwest chain
<Lambda|Eating> lol, I'm not surprised that you haven't, for tht very reason
<Lambda|Eating> oh, it might be
<Stormy> most of them are in Minnesota and Wisconsin
<Civic> But then agian what do I know~
<Lambda|Eating> I always assumed it was nationwide
<Lambda|Eating> but I never had any reason why I assumed that
<Stormy> I remember reading the paper that they put on the trays
<Corevette789> http://www.termlifeinsurance.org/15-things-you-should-know-about-weed/
<Stormy> And it listed all their locations
<Stormy> there actually weren't very many
<Lambda|Eating> Hm
<Lambda|Eating> XD, I just noticed something
<Lambda> There we go
<Sina3> okay
<Sina3> so i got WBFS manager
<Sina3> how do i partition without formatting the drive?
<Sina3> btw im googling it as well
<Aristeo> \o/
<Infamouz> i like me a mocha
<Lambda> Never had Mocha
<^Wulfgar^> wbfs manager FTL... just format the drive to fat32
<Lambda> I'm willing to try it sometime though
<Infamouz> whats the difference between a mocha anda capachino
<Infamouz> its good
<Infamouz> tastes more like chocolate than coffee
<Sina3> the drive is already FAT32
<Sina3> but backing it up
<Sina3> would take hours.
<Lambda> I haven't had cappucino either :P
<^Wulfgar^> why do you have to back it up?
<Infamouz> i personally hate coffee
<Sina3> i want to partition it as wbfsfat32
<Sina3> whoops
<^Wulfgar^> if it's already fat32, just convert .iso to .wbfs
<Sina3> wbfs/fat32
<Lambda> Hot drinks seem weird to me
<Sina3> im trying to use GXloader
<Infamouz> but i drink it to get me in a decent mood
<^Wulfgar^> you don't need wbfs
<Lambda> except hot chocolate
<Sina3> i dont think it supports FAT32
<^Wulfgar^> use CFGLoader, it's the best usb loader period
<Infamouz> i usually get cold "frappe" mochas
<Sina3> i know... i know.
<Sina3> i already use it
<Infamouz> tastes better
<Sina3> but i wanna see GX loader
<Sina3> but since its so much trouble...
<Sina3> nvm.
<Sina3> are there any other loaders that support FAT 32?
<Sina3> Wiiflow?
<Infamouz> or what you could just do is get a cup of coffee and some chocolate milk and mix it together and it taste pretty good
<^Wulfgar^> GX is for people with kids that want to just point at a game and press A, which can also be done with CFG
<Infamouz> i do that at walmart if i need a boost as they have coffee in the break room
<Lambda> yeah
<Infamouz> and if a need a desperate boost ill mix it with mountain dew
<Lambda> Ugh
<Lambda> isn't that disgusting?
<Infamouz> actually its pretty good
<Lambda> sounds gross
<Infamouz> mt dew over powers the coffee
<Sina3> i am a kid D:
<Sina3> xD
<Sina3> not really.
<Sina3> but i really like GUI
<Infamouz> i fear i may become addicted to caffeen
<Sina3> okay you know what
<Lambda> lol
<Sina3> here is a better question
<Infamouz> stormy do not walk the path i tread
<Sina3> is there anyway to change CFG loaders font?
<^Wulfgar^> of course
<Stormy> lol don't worry
*Lambda tries to imagine Stormy drinking mountain do... but can't
<Lambda> *dew
<Infamouz> for i walketh into a shadow in which i may never come back from
<Sina3> how o_o
<Sina3> i hate the font.
<Stormy> I don't drink anything with carbonation
<^Wulfgar^> Sina3, you can find a list of options for CFGLoader here: http://gwht.wikidot.com/configurable-options
<Sina3> its so..
<Sina3> pixelated
<Infamouz> i use to not to unless i was desperate
<Infamouz> now i dont mind it much
<Lambda> lol, shoulda seen her try my jelly belly soda
<Infamouz> i still hate coke
<Stormy> I can't drink it
*Infamouz looks leerily for rdx
<Stormy> I hate how the carbonation feels
<Lambda> I didn't even notice the carbonation XD
<Infamouz> jelly belly soda?
<Lambda> then Stormy drinks it
<Lambda> and stops after the first sip
<Lambda> yeah, it wasn't very good
<Lambda> but it wasn't very bad either
<Infamouz> jelly belly as in jelly bean?
<|Shadow|> LOL Sina3
<Lambda> yep
<|Shadow|> your such a mess
<|Shadow|> but i still love u
<Infamouz> i hate jelly beans
<Stormy> my parents bought it so I'd have something to drink there
<Lambda> It was them who bought it then?
<Stormy> not realizing that since it said "soda," it would be carbonated
<Lambda> lol
<Sina3> haha
<Stormy> I'm pretty sure it was
<Sina3> i think food makes you so much more loving
<Lambda> at least there was that bottled water there
<Sina3> or did someone drug you
<Sina3> haha
<Lambda> that was some nice and refreshing water if I do say so myself
<Stormy> Lambda downs a bottle of water in about two minutes
<Stormy> :P
<Lambda> XD yeah
<Lambda> if that even
<Prince-da> Woo, got HBC and the rest back on my 4.3 :)

<outcorpse> ? list
<Quanyails> 7What's the name of the exact guy who writes the soundtrack for media?
<Airwolve> music/sound director? soundtrack composer?
<Airwolve> there's all sorts of names for the job
<Bloatedfish> http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=1746
<Espeon> hi/wb
<TimeShift> I'm impressed. It's well-known the electric system of New York City is rotten, old and can't stand the demands, but despite it regularly fails, they still didn't do anything about it...
<outcorpse> anybody here used darkcorp?
<outcorpse> instead of cioscorp?
<outcorpse> :-)
<Kyu> 07...
<TimeShift> I mean - they fight wars all over the world, they dream about colonizing the moon and the mars, they fly into orbit, but they can't supply their towns with the electricity required?
<TimeShift> show me something that's more of a fail :P
<oxy> never heard of it, then agn I havent booted my wii up in awhile
<Lugianite> 2hm
<Bloatedfish> replacing infrastructure sounds expensive
<Kyu> 07well duh o3o
<Lugianite> 2politicians dont do crap until something happens, and when they do, its because whatever they pass lines their pockets
<Airwolve> it is if you're stupid enough to only have a single route to every destination so you've got to intentionally take the whole thing down for an upgrade
<Bloatedfish> well then there's your answer
<Bloatedfish> o-o
<Airwolve> compare with the UK national grid, which has several routes to most locations, and so large swathes of supply lines can be taken down for long replacement periods without interrupting the flow of power
<TimeShift> well, maybe that's the reason why ALL power lines in europe are redundant. Two out of three can fail without a city blacking out :P
<Lugianite> 2lol
<Airwolve> basically the main reason maintenance on America's system is expensive is because they were too cheap for any redundancy, so any maintenance work has to be done on live wires, and if it can't be done like that, it generally doesn't get done at all
<Lugianite> 2yup
<TimeShift> well, what about installing backup wires then? That's possible and new wires are needed anyways
<Mark0990> All, is it possible to downgrade IOS41?
<TimeShift> after the new wires are removed, just cut the old one's and replace them by the new one's
<Lugianite> 2Timeshift, look at my above comment and it sums up an american politician
<Lugianite> 2they cant get anything done
<Airwolve> refer to the part about being too cheap for any redundancy, and Lugianite's comment
<TimeShift> yeah, they prefer "popular" topics over common sense
<Bloatedfish> do politicians have control over that sort of thing? I'd have assumed engineers and city planners would have make most of the decisions...
<Airwolve> right now it's cheaper to overpay workers to maintain live wires than to replace the old ones, even if it's more expensive in the long run
<Mark0990> I have V3348 :(
<Lugianite> 2Bloatedfish : who contracts the engineers and construction for a state?
<Airwolve> and politicians don't have direct control, but they do control all the budgeting, so if they don't assign enough money to the electrics, nothing can be done to improve them
<TimeShift> dunno how it's done in america, but our states here have a budget and the cities have a budget, too
<Lugianite> 2trust me, its full of beurocratic BS
<Bloatedfish> just wait until our robot overlords arrive
<Bloatedfish> then it'll be fine
<Lugianite> 2lol
<Mark0990> hello?
<power1> i softmodded my wii and sometimes it plays the game and most time i get error 1167 and help

<Aurora> 6who?
<TimeShift> someone called blackiethedragon
<Aurora> 6kinda funny how they totally missed the difference between luane and your designs
<Quanyails> 7o3o
<Quanyails> 7Hey, Rora.
<Quanyails> 7*late again*
<TimeShift> it's even more funny she didn't search DA for this name - as ALL the art I have regarding her has her name as tag...
<Quanyails> 7Remember your old 'eat a rock' thingymabob?
<zu-zuXtimeshift> hi hi
<Quanyails> 7O_o
<Quanyails> 7Uh.
<Aurora> 6yes...?
<Damos> hey
<Quanyails> 7I have edible rocks from vacation. O3o
<zu-zuXtimeshift> hi hi hi
<Aurora> 6cool
<Kyu> 07lol
<Quanyails> 7So, erm, yeah.
<EpicStatsGuy> : / : / :3 / : / : / E: / : / : / :
<zu-zuXtimeshift> 4does any one have a pokemon drawing request?
<Aurora> 6why not try some for yourself
<Aurora> 6instead of asking everyone else
<zu-zuXtimeshift> 4ok
*Aristeo yawns and stretches :3
<TimeShift> know what's even more depressing? Only ONE artist answered to my request regarding a commission. And even that one didn't answer anymore after I sent a note with my contact details...
<zu-zuXtimeshift> 4hi timeshift ^^
<Aurora> 6hmm
<TimeShift> hi zu-zu
<Aurora> 6was your request rediculously specific?
<Aurora> 6because that shuts commissioners off
<TimeShift> I didn't even say what I wanted. All I was asked for was a contact adress
<Aurora> 6who'd you ask?
<TimeShift> she's called Electrosa
<LiThIuMx> ? list
<TimeShift> the first note's about two weeks ago, the second almost a week
<zu-zuXtimeshift> 4who?
<TimeShift> no response this far
*zu-zuXtimeshift 4hugs timeshift
<Aurora> 6maybe they're young artists who wont be able to do the commission?
<TimeShift> I didn't even say WHAT I want
<Aurora> 6I mean, they wil literally be unable to do it, whether because of payment or shipping
<zu-zuXtimeshift> 4???
<TimeShift> well Roara, whom would you recommend?
<TimeShift> I mean, you're an artist yourself and eventually know more artists than I do :P
<Kyu> 07someone else who's art you like that actually responds within 3 days? o3o
<Kyu> 07*whose o3o
<TimeShift> there's the problem: There are few artists doing Lugia art I like :P
<Aurora> 6you could check with braindeadmareep
<TimeShift> and two of them are usually here. But none of these two does have free resources
<zu-zuXtimeshift> 4i do lugia art infact ill do one now ^^
<Aurora> 6but if you're looking for lugia-specific artists, I'll have to look around
<Aurora> 6I highly doubt HeartGold would be into commissions...
<Sneas> o.o
<TimeShift> think you got my worries^^
<Aurora> 6what?
<zu-zuXtimeshift> 4im just doing lugia now
<Damos> 13http://www.lugia.us/fan-art.htm
<zu-zuXtimeshift> 4hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
<Quanyails> 7By the way, why's your name what it is, Zu?
<zu-zuXtimeshift> 4zu-zu
<TimeShift> and by the way: After two days of hospital, I'll be out having dinner at one of my favourite chinese restaurants. Just need something fresh, hot and healthy plus delicious^^
<Quanyails> 7Zu. For short.
<TimeShift> will be back in about one and a half hour or so
<zu-zuXtimeshift> 4ok

<zu-zuXtimeshift> 4hey xai
<Articuno> 12The reason we decided to go home then was because we smelled fire.. as in someone was there somewhere..

<Damos> 13Fireman?
<Xai> 05lugia said we should go left at a crossroads as it was shorter and we walked and walked and ended up exactly where we had turned back the first time

<drf|work> Articuno, hey
<Runix> <<owns an iPad and is fine with it
<drf|work> think you can fix the server config to allow more than 4(?) Mibbit users at once?
<drf|work> apparently Apple users are so dumb they don't knwo how to use /me
*drf|work runs
<Runix> im just lazy
*Runix uses an ipad
<LuciusMar> I know this might not be the best channel to ask, but, how to get customizemii running on linux?
<drf|work> !apple
<drf|away> 10EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW QUICKTIME
<drf|work> !apple
<Runix> im not used to IRC because i have a life srry

<Damos> 13!apple
<drf|away> 03EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW SAFARI
<Athenon> wine ftw?
<drf|work> what
<MuzerNtbk> LuciusMar, wine
<Dykam> I thought it was renamed to brickmii
<MuzerNtbk> or mono
<drf|work> also
<drf|work> another thing iphones can't do
<drf|work> QR codes
<MuzerNtbk> can't remember if it's .NET or native
<drf|work> those are fricking awesome
<drf|work> Android has it built in :D
<Dykam> mon
<Dykam> o
<Runix> how can you say ewwww to a browser that actually uses HTML5
<MuzerNtbk> Though I'm positive I have run it in the past
<Dykam> apparently it has mono support
<Runix> i hate Adobe flash D:
<Dykam> that is, no foolish hooks into the native world
<MuzerNtbk> mono it is then
<Runix> so slow
<Damos> 13I like my iphone
<Aurora> 6never realized how often drf hates apple on here
<Skylands> 10Wb
<Dykam> (some apps dare to depend on native libs... makes your app non-portable in one flash)
<Runix> hes a hater
<Skylands> 10Chumera
<Aurora> 6it really IS all the time
<Skylands> 10CHUM
<Damos> 13you see him saying !apple every day
<drf|away> 06EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW IPODS
*Damos 13hides
<LuciusMar> Yes, mono... but what to do? What to compile?
<drf|work> LOL
<Dykam> :/ at least wrap those functionallity, so it can be replaced..
<Runix> i resent that remark
<SheenaFox|Afk> He has dreams about destroying apple products.
<Dykam> LuciusMar, what linux are you on
<drf|work> No I don't
<MuzerNtbk> LuciusMar, ...compile?
<LuciusMar> Dykam: distro?
<drf|work> I actually haven't :/
<MuzerNtbk> just run the .exe via mono
<Dykam> ubuntu
<drf|work> I did destroy one for real once
<Dykam> fedora
<Damos> 13except the fruit
<Runix> you do know they oiutlast hardware wise
<LuciusMar> MuzerNtbk: I don't need to compile? >_>
<LuciusMar> Dykam: Debian (testing)
<MuzerNtbk> LuciusMar, no
<Dykam> has mono
<Runix> i put Windows on my Mac
<MuzerNtbk> install mono
<Runix> ^^
<MuzerNtbk> run the exe through mono
<Chimera> WUT
<MuzerNtbk> ???
<MuzerNtbk> profit!
<Chimera> :3
<Dykam> wait
*Chimera noms
<LuciusMar> oh.
<Runix> that or Ubuntu Linux
<Dykam> you need the winforms packages I think
<MuzerNtbk> yeah
<LuciusMar> I thought of mono as a framework
<Skylands> 10om nom nom
<MuzerNtbk> what Dykam said, probably
<Runix> kinda fun
<drf|work> you do realize taht doesn't actually matter, right?
<Dykam> install the libmono-winforms2.0-cil package
<Chimera> |3
<drf|work> *that
<Damos> 13Guest
<MuzerNtbk> LuciusMar, it's more like the evil MS version of Java
<Runix> it does
<drf|work> Apple hardware is waaaay inferior to proper hardware
<Dykam> prolly pulls in the mono framework too
<Damos> 13hey Quany
<Quanyails> 07Hmm, Java.
<drf|work> like you pay 3x the cost
<drf|work> I built my own computer
<Dykam> <MuzerNtbk> LuciusMar, it's more like the evil MS version of Java - you meant "evil ms", right?
<drf|work> it'll beat any mac hands down
<Runix> Quality Hardware + Windows 7 = best gaming machine evar
<drf|work> and it cost less than your typical Mac
<Dykam> not evil version
<drf|work> a *lot* less
<Quanyails> 07Both Java and my firewall flare up at it.
<Damos> 13I like Windows and Microsoft
<drf|work> and I have an i7
<Runix> dude, they have a desktop thats $500
<drf|work> Quany, have you ever used CGI:IRC?
<Damos> 13mostly becuase of FSX
<Runix> i have i7 as well
<drf|work> Runix, have you even seen the specs in that?
<MuzerNtbk> well, it's BASICALLY just Java
<MuzerNtbk> lol
<MuzerNtbk> :P
<Runix> i paid $1300 for my MB Pro
<drf|work> it has a crapslow dual core if that
<MuzerNtbk> which is why I said version
<Dykam> no...
<Quanyails> 07One second, clone coming:
<drf|work> OK, and what are the specs of that?
<Dykam> java has no generics...
<Damos> 13Clooone
<Dykam> anyway, not going to defend
<MuzerNtbk> also, version can mean "equivalent", in more informal uses
<Dykam> (both are VM's , that's true)
*Damos 13greets the clone
<Quanyails> 07Java is a fish.
*drf|work pokes Quanyails with http://www.drfsupercenter.info/IRC/
<Bloodari> hey guys
<Quanyails> 07o3o
<drf|work> also keep in mind
<drf|work> that Mibbit basically took CGI:IRC and made it look fancier
<Bloodari> CFGloader, how do you get it to autoload wbfs folder on a fat32 drive
<Runix> 2.53GHz Intel Core i5 processor with 3MB shared L3 cache; or optional 2.66GHz Intel Core i7 processor with 4MB shared L3 cache
<Damos> 13welcome though you soon will not live
<Bloodari> instead of always trying to load wbfs1 part
<Athenon> if generics are what im thinking, java has them
<Dykam> you could call java a version of Oak :3
<Damos> 13because your a clone
<drf|work> How much do you have to pay to get that i7 in there?
<drf|work> like $4000?
<Runix> nope
<Damos> 13is there a i8
<drf|work> no.
<Runix> if you previously worked for apple you get to mod it for cheaper
<drf|work> there's an i7 Extreme with 6 cores though
<drf|work> you worked for Apple?
<Damos> 13oh
<Damos> 13no
<drf|work> I'm not talking to you Damos
<Damos> 13don't even have a job
<Damos> 13oooooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
<drf|work> XD
<drf|work> I do
<Runix> NVIDIA GeForce GT 330M graphics processor with 512MB of GDDR3 memory
<drf|work> I'm at it right now :)
<Damos> 13sorry
*Damos 13goes back to huging his Lugia
<drf|work> my MSI has a 160M with 1GB DDR3
<LuciusMar> wow
<LuciusMar> Thank you, guys
*Quanyails adds a G to Damos's last statement.
<Runix> i used to work with apple
<drf|work> I could easily upgrade it to a 260
<drf|work> It just wasn't out at the time
<drf|work> XD
<drf|work> and eh
<Runix> so im liked at our store
<drf|work> well I'm talking about typical users
<drf|work> not Apple VIPs
<drf|work> if I were to walk in there
<drf|work> they'd sell me some crap and charge $2000 for t
<drf|work> *it
<Runix> then you pay the price
<Runix> less exploding, more worky
<drf|work> OK
<Dykam> <Athenon> if generics are what im thinking, java has them - was talking about the VM
<Damos> 13ebay
<drf|work> now keep in mind
<Runix> like HP xD
<drf|work> I don't work for Microsoft either
<drf|work> and I still get their stuff for cheap
<drf|work> :P
<Dykam> java's generics are just a way of hiding numerous casts
<Dykam> :D
<Damos> 13arn't you a little young to be working for Microsoft
<Runix> because microsoft uses a fail system on top of a bad filesystem
<Articuno> 12Is Roara around?
<Athenon> lol
<Dykam> if you are about speed... :P
<lukegb> Dykam: whut, so C# is better? :P
<Dykam> from a language and VM perspective, totally yes
<lukegb> Dykam: I should point out either a) I'm doing something wrong or b) System.Windows.Forms implementation under Mono is not exactly the same as on Windows
<Dykam> not going to discuss about microsoft f;flaming though :P
<Articuno> 12I has arts
<drf|work> orly?
<drf|work> what's wrong with NTFS?
<drf|work> anyway
<Aurora> 6I'm here
<Runix> NTFS is the biggest piece of junk when it comes to storing crap
<Quanyails> 07o3o
<Runix> it just shares all the memory into one object instead of compiling it individually
<Damos> 13never heard of NTFS
<Runix> thats why it runs slow the more you have open
<drf|work> here's the specs of my self-built desktop: Intel Core i7 860 (2.8GHz quad with hyperthreading), 8GB of DDR3 RAM, 1600MHz, a NVIDIA GeForce 260GTX card, EVGA version which is factory overclocked, 3x 1TB Hitachi DeskStar
<Runix> NTFS is a windows filesystem
<zu-zuXtimeshift> 4im back
<drf|work> Damos, don't try to talk about something you know nothing about please
<Runix> Quads burn out quickly on normal PC's
<Runix> trust me

<drf|work> I spent a little over $1000
<Runix> same specs as your basically, just rigged nicer
<drf|work> and that's mainly due to the 3 hard drives and the fact that I have a Blu-Ray burner.
<Damos> 13that must be a rip off
<Articuno> 12http://a.imagehost.org/0971/Lugia124.jpg
<drf|work> that's another thing Apple computers don't and will never have
<Damos> 13probably from ebey
<drf|work> is Blu-Ray readers, let alone even *burners*
<Damos> 13ebay*
<Dykam> lukegb, it lends from wine...
<Aurora> 6arti's drawing more lugia <3<3<3

<lukegb> Dykam: I think it uses System.Drawing, which is implemented over it's own driver (gdiplus, mebbe wine? :/)
<drf|work> LOL
<Bloatedfish> that sounds like a troll
*drf|work rofl's at the idea of websites being hosted on a Mac
<Damos> 13its perfect

<Runix> i use Adobe Creative Suit CS5
<Dykam> I dunno exactly about mono's implementation really
*Damos 13hugs it

<Damos> 13thats now my new favorite picture
<Articuno> 12I swear by Adobe for my art, most artists do :>
<drf|work> LOL
<Aurora> 6something scared it, now it's making a load of noise
<drf|work> Go use GIMP
<drf|work> or Paint Shop Pro
<drf|work> or something decent
<Runix> GIMP i cant use for my work
<Articuno> 12Gimp and PSP are HORRIUBLE
<Absol> >implying Adobe is bad
<Runix> i use it, i lose the job
<Aurora> 6I'm struggling to get ahold of photoshop
<Aurora> 6I really miss paint sai

<Aicebo> DDDDD:!!!!
<Damos> 13-e
<drf|work> btw
<drf|work> Articuno
<drf|work> do you have the Barcode Scanner app on your phone?
<Dykam> MuzerNtbk, hehe, the only one I tested
<Runix> Articuno and i both use Photoshop for our work
<Articuno> 12Yes ^^
<zu-zuXtimeshift> 4i use paint aswell
<Damos> 13ahhh wrong link
<Articuno> 12Although I totally dont need it
<drf|work> http://img196.imageshack.us/img196/8818/chartchtqrchs350x350chl.png
<drf|work> Scan that LOL
<Articuno> 12So I uninstalled it after I tested it
<MuzerNtbk> GTK does suck
<drf|work> ...
<MuzerNtbk> Qt :D
<Articuno> 12That is NO barcode XD
<Skylands> 10Peer'd
<drf|work> yes it is
<drf|work> that's a QR coe

<Articuno> 12Well, I don't need to do it LOL
<Runix> so?
<Articuno> 12So I'm not bothered about reinstalling it
<drf|work> LOL
<Aicebo> ....oh so none of you are here to enjoy the fail
<Aicebo> ok then.
<lukegb> I would do a demo video, but the NUS was down just a minute ago when I checked
<Runix> Barcode scanning on a phone is just lame in general guys
<drf|work> it basically says "this code was made by drfsupercenter, here's the website if you want to make your own"
<drf|work> and it has the link
<drf|work> orly
<drf|work> you keep telling yourself that
<MuzerNtbk> anyway, 27th August! Avatar rereleased in cinema! With extra footage! :D
<drf|work> I'm also guessing multitasking on a phone is lame?
<Runix> i do
<Runix> im happy with what i have and what i dont need
<drf|work> you're just a typical Apple fanboy -_-
<Absol> Runix, why do they require you to use photoshop
<Quanyails> 07I miss Mibbit already. D:
<Runix> your the one attacking it as its the worst thing in the world m8
<MuzerNtbk> Oe lu nitram!
<Dykam> lukegb, what did you try?
<Damos> 13then use it
<drf|work> because you're a fanboy
<drf|work> Quany, HAVE YOU TRIED USING CGI:IRC
<drf|work> I asked like 3 times
<Runix> not really
*Lugia slips away to steal Articuno's latest drawing
<Damos> 13you have Access
<drf|work> Java is NOT the only other option
<Runix> im using a desktop right now

<Runix> the market here only uses proper registered adobe products
<Aurora> 6runix, what's your job?
<Absol> and also how do they know if you used it
<Runix> either you dont have it or you have to go buy it to even get the job
<drf|work> Quanyails	It's the quick, temporary one, DRF. :P <-- How is Java any faster than CGI:IRC?
<drf|work> have you even *tried* CGI?
<Runix> im a Professional Graphic Designer

<Damos> 13hey [TST]Bot

<drf|work> SIGH
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14XD
<drf|work> See, YOU are the one acting like a child here
<Quanyails> 07Erm...
<tpw_rules> lol#
<TimeShift> as I said - the bot's made of fail :)
*zu-zuXtimeshift 4give Quanyails a bomb
<Quanyails> 07I actually agree with DRF.
<drf|work> you realize how annoying it is for me to keep VNC'ing into it?
<drf|work> and keep fixing what you cause?
*Damos 13gives drf a ticking cookie
*Quanyails chucks it at TimeShift.
<Dykam> there is a lolcode compiler for .net
*zu-zuXtimeshift 4defends timeshift
<TimeShift> just wanted to show how useless the "ignore" of the bot is
<zu-zuXtimeshift> 4 0.0
<zu-zuXtimeshift> 4lol
<Dykam> you could call that lol#
<drf|work> TimeShift, should I also show how useless a ban is then?
<drf|work> by evading it over 9000 times?
<Damos> 13Wb [TSTy}
<Damos> 13]*
<TimeShift> well, you forget one thing drf
<TimeShift> someone evading a meant ban WILL be GLINED for the rest of his life
<Aurora> 6TimeShift, why ARE you being so annoying about the bot?
<TimeShift> and THAT's NOT evadeable
<Damos> 13Really you evaded from getting banned a lot
<Damos> 13of times?
*zu-zuXtimeshift 4gets punched in the eye
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Blah, I'll come back when things settle down
<drf|work> TimeShift	someone evading a meant ban WILL be GLINED for the rest of his life <-- orly?
<drf|work> evading bans is easy
<zu-zuXtimeshift> 4x.o ouch...
<drf|work> just use one of the many CGI:IRC clients LOL
<Black_Latios> 02http://blacklatios.deviantart.com/#/d2ti5it
*drf|work saw that t, than that it...
*drf|work runs
<zu-zuXtimeshift> 4someone heal my bad eye
<tpw_rules> hah
<lukegb> Dykam: Qt# is a wrapper :P
*Damos 13has nightmares
*Aurora 6pokes the other eye
<Dykam> GTK# too
<Damos> 13kidding
*LaptopAristeo yawns
<drf|work> XD
<Damos> 13its um
<LaptopAristeo> 9 minutes until the meeting :3
<drf|work> Poke one more, and it's a federal offense
*drf|work hides
<Dykam> must they must have done it right to be able to swap the platform specific stuff
<Damos> 13I'm just going to shut up now
<zu-zuXtimeshift> 4ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
<LuciusMar> And, a bit off - i can't find any good wii pictures, for making a banner, what pictures do you use?
<Black_Latios> 02agh, i NOW GOT SOMETHING IN MY EYE d:
<Black_Latios> 02caps >_<
<TimeShift> and Roara: It's simple. Without pinpointing the weakness there's no motivation to fix the error
*Damos 13help clean it out
<Black_Latios> 02D:*
<drf|work> TimeShift
<Aurora> 6...
<drf|work> do YOU wanna fix the error?
<Damos> 13+s
<drf|work> that script just calls Google
*zu-zuXtimeshift 4heals Black_Latios' eye
<drf|work> if you define something that you KNOW will get it kicked
<TimeShift> it's not my bot, right?
<drf|work> how is it supposed to not define it
<TimeShift> and by the way, of us two, YOU are the one with more spare time
<drf|work> yes, but you know darn well that defining things like RTFM will kill it
<drf|work> true, but I don't know perl
<zu-zuXtimeshift> 4man...
<drf|work> I just got the script from a database
*drf|work sighs
<drf|work> this stupid SysAid software keeps freezing >_>
<|Omega|> Qyoto.
<TimeShift> there're plenty of books out there to learn it. Or you could ask Arti to put the bot on the not-ban-whitelist. You did none of both
<LaptopAristeo> Breeze: Stryker turned me into a girl so I could be her girlfriend
<drf|work> why would Arti do that?
<TimeShift> because you ask her for it?
<|Omega|> Qt <3
<drf|work> but why would she actually do that?
*Stryker wakes up due to the highlighting.
<Stryker> <3
<LaptopAristeo> <3
<LaptopAristeo> Hi dear :)
<Damos> 13bye BlackLatios
<TimeShift> so the bot wouldn't be kicked if she agrees he's useful?
<drf|work> I mean, if someone does that on accident, that's understandable
<drf|work> but if you keep intentionally killing it 20 times in a row
<drf|work> why should she defend that?
<Stryker> Hello. :3
<lukegb> |Omega|: there is that :P
<TimeShift> because there might be other definitions out there also kicking the bot? Like - the first definition of rtfm or gtfo weren't known by me to be able to kick the bot
<TimeShift> therefore, because they remove the bot from the chat, it's an error in design that should be fixed
<TimeShift> and an error is NOT fixed by closing the eyes and thinking "just don't say it. Then the error won't occur". Sitting-out an error never worked in history and won't work here
<zu-zuXtimeshift> 4goodbye
<Articuno> 12Um hi
<Articuno> 12TimeShift did you see my new art?
<Quanyails> 07Ohai, Arti.
<drf|work> how would you not know that "get the f*** out" would kick the bot?
<Aurora> 6ok but still
<zu-zuXtimeshift> 4im not leavinig
<drf|work> it's still pretty obvious
<Aurora> 6you're the one posting it over and over again o-o
<drf|work> plus if it truly is an accident
<drf|work> I don't mind fixing it
<drf|work> it's just annoying when you keep doing it intentionally
<drf|work> as I have to keep logging into VNC to the server to fix it
<TimeShift> no I didn't til now Arti
*LaptopAristeo snuggles up to Stryker
<TimeShift> where is it?
<Articuno> 12http://a.imagehost.org/0971/Lugia124.jpg
<LaptopAristeo> This building is supposed to closed, but I'm in it :3
<TimeShift> whew finally some more Lugia by you^^
<LaptopAristeo> *rawr*
<Stryker> You're special. :O
<zu-zuXtimeshift> 4i absoluttly love that arti
*LaptopAristeo and about 10 other people
*Stryker huggles Aristeo.
<Stryker> :o
<zu-zuXtimeshift> 4can you do a lugia called silver please
<Stryker> The chosen ones!
<LaptopAristeo> :D
<TimeShift> and yeah drf - just move on doing the same thing. Life goes on....like it was with the dinosaurs, right?

<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Mibbit fail lol
<LaptopAristeo> Gonna be fun though, methinks
<drf|work> wtf happened there
<Articuno> 12It's not very good Lugia art though btu I'm still trying
<Quanyails> 07Mibbit. o3o
<drf|work> yeah I know
<Articuno> 12Busy now!
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14drf, mibbit failed
<Quanyails> 07*late*
<drf|work> I thought maybe timeShift tried to ban me or something
<drf|work> wouldn't put it past him
*drf|work sighs @ Mibbit
<Arti|HL> 12LOL timeShift LOLOL
<Quanyails> 07That's busy, lol? :P
<drf|work> and see, this is plenty fast, I don't know why people don't like it
<drf|work> LOL Arti, my shift key sucks
<Quanyails> 07Brb. Again.
<drf|work> and YES I PUT THE F IN THERE
<TimeShift> I'm not banning people out of fun and randomly. Not anymore :P
<Runix> wth was that?
<drf|work> LOL
<drf|work> Still, Arti
<drf|work> can you fix that @ the server?
<drf|work> so that more people can use Mibbit at once?
<drf|work> as this kinda sucks
<Runix> i got banned from session w.e
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02o3o
<drf|work> yeah so did I
<drf|work> Mibbit sucks like that
<Runix> agreed
<drf|work> see, I don't mak fun of things for nothing :P
<drf|work> one benefit to CGI:IRC
<drf|work> none of those STUPID emoticons
<drf|work> I wish you could turn those the frick off in Mibbit
<drf|work> it bugs the heck out of me
<Quanyails> 07You can, I think.
*Quanyails checks
<drf|work> how so?
<Skylands> 10Hey Shi-shi
<Quanyails> 07Are you using the Mibbit widget or the site client?
<drf|work> the actual site.
<drf|work> why would I use the widget o.o
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Hey Sky
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Quan!
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I need to know if you'll help me with a picture I drew
<Quanyails> 07Hey, Shiny.
<Skylands> 10Check this out http://g-fauxpokemon.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d1x9i6z
<Skylands> 10o3o
<Quanyails> 07One sec, gotta help DRF first.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02That's fine
<Aeroslash> hi all
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Hiya Slash
<Quanyails> 07You'd need an account to modify the smileys.
<Aeroslash> hi ^^
<Quanyails> 07Registered there? :P
<Runix> Aero
*Runix glomps
<drf|work> Yes I'm registered
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Looks more like a dog/weasle to me o3o
<drf|work> though since it's currently not working @ TST it does me no good
<Quanyails> 07Oh.
<Aeroslash> hi Runix ^^
<Quanyails> 07Well, for future reference, go to Prefs, smileys, and delete all of them.
<Skylands> 10XD
<drf|work> delete them?
<drf|work> lemme try
<drf|work> I'm still on Mibbit on another server
<drf|work> LOL my font just got bigger
<drf|work> since I once set it that way
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02But tbh even for that I still wouldn't evolve my Growlithe XD
<Skylands> 10Yeh, it's worse than Arcanine
<Quanyails> 07Don't forget to save your setting afterwards.
<drf|work> OK
*Shiny-Growlithe sprawls out on Slash
<drf|work> Quany, what's the default font size?
<drf|work> as I changed it
<drf|work> I need to change it back
<Quanyails> 0715.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Did you see my picture I posted in the cbox? o3o
*Aeroslash smiles and pets the Shiny Growlithe
<Skylands> 10Yus
<drf|work> .....
<drf|work> it IS on 15
<Skylands> 10It reminds me of something off of Narnia
<drf|work> why's it so big?
<drf|work> inb4 "that's what she said"
<Quanyails> 07o.O
<Quanyails> 07Is it the window itself?
<Quanyails> 07Control + scroll wheel?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02:U
<drf|work> no
<drf|work> it just got bigger when I logged inm.
<drf|work> -m
<drf|work> I like the default size for when you're not logged in
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02The only pictures I've been looking at for references were deer/caribu feet and my memories of my dream
<sockmister> So is this Epic?
<drf|work> oh wait
<drf|work> nvm
<drf|work> it was on 16
<Skylands> 10Then you have epic skills at not intentionally referencing other things LOL
<drf|work> what's the usual font for the channel tabs at the top?
<drf|work> *that's* what I made bigger
<drf|work> er size
*Curly falls out of bed
<Curly> um... yes? :o
<Quanyails> 07I don't think you can change that's sizes.
<Quanyails> 07If messed, you could just try defaulting everything.
<drf|work> oh
<drf|work> how do you default everything?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I do have epic skills don't I? |D *shot*
<EpicStatsGuy> : / : / :3 / : / : / E: / : / : / :
<raw_shock> hi all
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Hiya Sneas
<raw_shock> is anybody here?
<Bloodari> ? list
<Quanyails> 07Right below My perefences, to the right of Save and Close
<Bloodari> ? usenet
<drf|work> aha
<drf|work> thanks, that did the trick
<drf|work> now lemme redo the smileys...
<zc00gii> |Omega|: Qt <3
<drf|work> can you make Mibbit auto-connect like mIRC can?
<Sneas> hi
<Quanyails> 07No, but you can set up a one-click connect.
<|Omega|> is there a lisp binding? :p
<Skylands> 10!sneas
*work now belongs to Skylands for 14 minutes
<Quanyails> 07You can set up a script to instantly join any channel.
<Quanyails> 07Ghost, etc.
<drf|work> one click?
<Sneas> ^^
<Skylands> 10:3
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I swear if I tried to make my character's body fluffy I'd be torn apart
<Quanyails> 07Two, since you have to click the Account tab.
<drf|work> o.o
<drf|work> well
<drf|work> I told it to autologin
<Skylands> 10Floofy would make more sense
*Skylands hides
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02It would be like: "I wanna hug his floof, but I don't wanna die"
<Quanyails> 07Okay.
<drf|work> so how would I do it
<Quanyails> 07Under account:
<Skylands> 10I wonder how many deaths floof has caused
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Suffocating
<raw_shock> helooooooo
<Quanyails> 07Under IRC server details.
<Quanyails> 07Add your info.
<Stryker> It is not. Clearly.
<Quanyails> 07It doesn't have a join-channel box, so scripts come in there.
<Quanyails> 07I think.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Btw, you'e made me curious, what does my character look similar to in Narnia?
<drf|work> ah
<drf|work> I'll just do it manually
<Curly> shhhh
<drf|work> as it wants my default nickname
<drf|work> and I'm only drf|work at work
<Skylands> 10One of the hybrids
<Curly> they're not supposed to know that!
<Quanyails> 07Okay.
<Skylands> 10Dunno which one it was
<Quanyails> 07You can put two entries. :P
<Skylands> 10It was like a cross of minotaur and goat
<Quanyails> 07One for drf|work, one for drfsupercenter, one for drf|away...
<zc00gii> |Omega|: shitty ones
<Skylands> 10or maybe I'm just thinking of Runescape
*Skylands shrugs
<zc00gii> I'm going to write my own binding soon
<zc00gii> it's soooo easy to make bindings in lisp compared to other languages
<drf|work> I never use Mibbit as drfsupercenter
<drf|work> only when I'm not at home
<Stryker> D:
<drf|work> drf|library etc XD
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I wish it was more original then :<
<zc00gii> I made a defcarray function =D
*Stryker shuts up and sits in the corner.
<Quanyails> 07Okay.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I wanted to put rib bones on his neck but then I figured out that he would seem more like Girantina after that
<drf|work> nvm, the smileys thing shoudl be fixed
<drf|work> I wonder if it'll work on TST again
<zc00gii> |Omega|: I'm going to be doing common lisp classes in a week or two in this one channel
<zc00gii> I think you'll love it once you learn it
<Skylands> 10lulz
<drf|work> nope.

<|Omega|> Today, I've watched a 'lecture' about programming languages.
<Skylands> 10Whoops, I forgot to direct link
<Skylands> 10Oh well, just scroll down
<zc00gii> cool, oh, that railsconf link?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02o3o
<zc00gii> I watched part of that
<Skylands> 10X3
<|Omega|> Yeah
<|Omega|> It's actually pretty cool
<zc00gii> yeah
<|Omega|> Have you tried clojure?
<lukegb> zc00gii: assembly?
<zc00gii> uhh, there(hopefully) will be another guy doing it too, he taught me
<zc00gii> |Omega|: no, I know a guy who's really into it though
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02XP
<|Omega|> I hear it's cool.
<|Omega|> From the railconf link
<zc00gii> lukegb: I've never sat down long enough to learn it :S
<|Omega|> Also, where can I read up on their Python stuff?
<zc00gii> |Omega|: look at the topic, it's got logs
<|Omega|> Yeah, they don't work
*Curly rolls over to the corner and falls asleep
<Runix> Arti is playing Half Life

*Stryker gets some ketchup.
<Stryker> I'm sure I taste bland. D:

<Articuno> 12Sorry Im going for dinner, ask TimeShift
<Arcanine> 04i see
<Quanyails> 07Uh.
<Arcanine> 04Shiny-Growlithe my main question is how did it get into the house
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02It didn't get into our house, my dad was outside
<Arcanine> 04i see
<Neon> Hey.
<Arcanine> 04but i'm asking the question to myself lol
<Aicebo> what's up
<Neko> heh i've had bats get into my house
<Neko> then again when you live in 100 year old houses
<Neko> :x
<Neko> anything goes
<Neko> normally i use a net to catch it
<Neko> though there was one, that was bleed as it slammed against something glass, and i had to kill it since it couldn't fly anymore either..
<Neko> bleeding*
<Arcanine> 04hmm
<Arcanine> 04we are going to get a tennis racket now XD
<Neko> nou
<drf|work> oh, I figured it out
<drf|work> when she gets back
<drf|work> or somebody
<drf|work> TimeShift, you there?
<TimeShift> I am
<drf|work> OK
<drf|work> /msg OperServ exception add +0 *.mibbit.com 50 reason
<drf|work> can you try that?
<drf|work> I think it errored since the /os alias isn't set
<Neko> hi
<TimeShift> already tried, but I'm receiving the same message like Arti
<LaptopAristeo> Back!
<Lunies> Hi
*LaptopAristeo waves to sockmister
<LaptopAristeo> There is a pretty hot girl in front of me right now >.>
<LaptopAristeo> Like a few feet away from me
<TimeShift> possibly because this command is not supported by our IRC server
<drf|work> huh
<drf|work> well I tried it, and got an error saying I'm not authorized
<drf|work> not a "no such nick/channel"
<drf|work> do you know if nickserv is Anope, or what?
<Bloodari> hmm
<Bloodari> is it worth the money
<Bloodari> Much better than torrents for everything?
<Neko> it does suck when a bat gets stuck in your house
<TimeShift> (22:01:57) -> *OperServ* exception add +0 *.mibbit.com 50 reason
<TimeShift> (22:01:57) (OperServ) Access denied.
<LaptopAristeo> :3
<Neko> though like i said, that's why i have a net handy if something like that gets in
<Neko> i've also had to deal with birds
<LaptopAristeo> Curly!
<LaptopAristeo> :D
<TimeShift> I believe that's a command only the server owner can do
<drf|work> oh
<drf|work> OK
<drf|work> well then it does in fact work, we just need Articuno to do it
<drf|work> I think it's just /os that isn't set by the server
<Aicebo> Stormy|Work LaptopAristeo Prince-dari Ryft RDX|Sleeping wake the [censored] up
<TimeShift> possibly, yeah
<Prince-dari> Hey.

<Quanyails> 07For the competition? C:
<Kipikipo> Sprite a knight
<Kipikipo> :O
<drf|work> no

<drf|work> Sierra Mist is more fun
<drf|work> or Smist as somebody I knew IRL called it XD
<Chimera> :3
<Quanyails> 07Runix asked how to make one.
<VoltTheElectrike> 3just put pokemon parts together, then match up the colors
<Quanyails> 07Not what to make. :P
<Quanyails> 07Easy for you to say, Volt.
<drf|work> yeah, that's basically all there is to it -_-
<Quanyails> 07That'd be a newb's way.
<drf|work> here's what you do
<drf|work> take a picture
<drf|work> resize it to 16x16
<drf|work> and you have a sprite
*drf|work hides
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Lol Quan I was just thinking that earlier today
<Quanyails> 07Erm, no.
<drf|work> orly?
<Espeon> in before tl;dr
<drf|work> as I'm quite sure that would work
<Quanyails> 07Nope.
<Quanyails> 07You get a big blur.
<Kipikipo> >:3
<drf|work> http://www.brothersoft.com/games/easy-sprite-maker.html
<Kipikipo> I'ma shower now.
<drf|work> http://spritegen.website-performance.org/ <-- an online version
<drf|work> >:P
<Quanyails> 07No images? No proof? Any ratings?
<drf|work> I'll try it right now./
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02lol
<drf|work> oh sigh
<drf|work> it needs at least 2 pictures LOL
<Quanyails> 07o3o
<Quanyails> 07Uh?
<drf|work> CSS sprites are the wrong thing I think
<Quanyails> 07Lol.
<drf|work> http://www.famitsu.com/freegame/tool/chibi/index1.html LOL
<drf|work> Japanese character sprite maker
<drf|work> that's only for humans though
<Quanyails> 07Sure, but that's someone else's work for your use.
<Aicebo> did you feel them to see if they were real LaptopAristeo
<drf|work> OK well I'm to lazy to find something here
<drf|work> but I'm sure there are programs that can do it fine.
<Quanyails> 07Suuuuuuuure, and there are programs which can make full-blown miscellaneous digital artwork!
<Quanyails> 07>>
<drf|work> there are
<drf|work> it's called a camera
*drf|work hides
<sockmister> Back
<Quanyails> 07Camera is photography. :P
<Quanyails> 07Digital =/= Photography.
<drf|work> orly?
<drf|work> how is a JPG file not digital?
<drf|work> that's precisely the point of a digital camera - to turn something IRL into something digital
<drf|work> XD
<Bloodari> Hey guys
<Bloodari> I just got the astra web
*Shiny-Growlithe ywans
<Quanyails> 07Lol, if you say that's the case, then a big scribble done on the computer is technically digital art.
<Bloodari> which port is it best to use
<Bloodari> and how do i setup ssl?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I'm off to bed for a nap, cya guys
<Blackwolf> lol
<Blackwolf> you know they have all this on thier page
<Airwolve> by technical definition even a photograph on film is digital, as it does have a resolution, it's just very fine and non-regular
<drf|work> it is.
<Blackwolf> what ports to use, server addresses, what ports for ssl etc
<drf|work> not really
<drf|work> 35mm film is analog
<[SR]> lol some people are retarded
<drf|work> it has no set resolution
<drf|work> you can just scan it into one
<drf|work> hence how Blu-Rays are made
<drf|work> by rescanning 50 year old movies
<Airwolve> no set resolution, but there is a resolution
<drf|work> not really
<Bloodari> oh when i signed up it just spit out id pass and a bunch of ports it said i could use
<Airwolve> and digital's definition is that whatever is stored is discrete, hence anything with a resolution is digital
<Bloodari> ill go look around thanks
<LaptopAristeo> Nuh uh
<RuPeRt> astra web what a loser
<LaptopAristeo> I'll see her around though :3
<Aicebo> ...XD
<LaptopAristeo> I'll feel them next week at the dance :) maybe
<LaptopAristeo> :D
<Aicebo> LOL
<Bloodari> whats wrong with astra web?
<Andres> Oh, hi btw.
<LaptopAristeo> I gotta go home now, I'll be back in about 45
<LaptopAristeo> <3
<LaptopAristeo> Byeeeeeeeee
<drf|work> is it?
<Andres> Bai Stoneari
<Quanyails> !define digital
<[TST]Bot> -!- displaying numbers rather than scale positions; "digital clock"; "digital readout"
<Airwolve> that is the definition of digital, yes
<Aurora> oh wow it works again
<Perseid> Nothing is wrong with astra.
<Aurora> only took a few hours
<drf|work> what does?
<Aurora> mibbit refused to let me on
<Quanyails> 07What, Mibbit?
<RuPeRt> i will blaze astraweb anyday
<drf|work> oh
<drf|work> Quany, got another question for you.
<Quanyails> 07Yes?
<drf|work> Is it possible to have Mibbit show the full hostmask?
<Aurora> 6ew name+y
<drf|work> *** Aurora [Floof@Floofity.Floof.Floof] has joined #SilverWings <-- like that
<drf|work> I hate how it hides it
<Quanyails> 07Yep.
<Airwolve> analogue by comparison is continuous, hence the scale positions mentioned in that definition
<drf|work> Aurora, orly?
<drf|work> I just took the first 5 letters
<Quanyails> 07Hold on, lemme find it on the page:
<drf|work> it's like saying my name, Danny, is Dann + y
<drf|work> not really, it just ends in a y...
<Aurora> 6but quan's nickname is quan
<RGB_Gamer> i just signed on with astraweb after being with giganews since 06
<Espeon> My MW2 disc is broken
<Espeon> I'm FINALLY FREE
<RGB_Gamer> it's pretty damn good
<Espeon> !!!
<Bloodari> thanks, even though you called me a tard you pointed me in the right direction ;)
<drf|work> to you it is o.o
<Aurora> 6I hate names that end in y unless it's something I grew up used to
<Soyuz> :D
<[SR]> well i sure as hell wouldnt have ever been with giganews thats for sure
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14LOL
<drf|work> she was the one who told me to put "Quany" down in Pokmon Diamond
<drf|work> so I did
<drf|work> XD
<Aurora> 6danny is too common
<Bloodari> logging in to the site gaveme all the connection info
<Aurora> 6so I'm used to it
<Soyuz> lets celibrate by destroying Modern warfare and MW 2 everywhere :O
<drf|work> but so is your IRL name
<drf|work> so yeah
<Aurora> 6but things like doggy, kitty, roary, etc
<Quanyails> 07Hmm... testing:
<Quanyails> 07Brb.
<RuPeRt> i didnt point u into no torrent shit
<Espeon> Now I can be cool on the internet by taping myself smashing it with a hammer. But it will probably have painkiller.
<drf|work> LOL roary

<drf|work> kitty and whatnot I don't mind
<Bloodari> what are you talking about

<RuPeRt> yea i am a bot an ai bot u speak i type back

*Andres bites Stryker >:3
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Add the check to Extra join info.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6And save.
<drf|work> ...
<drf|work> I could have just as easily unchecked "Show smileys"
<drf|work> instead I deleted them all :|
<Shadow_Lugia> 6o.o
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Didn't notice that. :P
<Espeon> I feel weird for feeling happy that my MW2 disc is broken
<Airwolve> why? it suckz
<Espeon> That's why I feel happy.
<drf|work> hm
<drf|work> someone /hop please?
<Espeon> 6meow

<Airwolve> /hop
<drf|work> hm

<Espeon> what kindasorta worked
<drf|work> *** Espeon joined #SilverWings Espeon@Twice.The.Fun <-- that's completely backwards, thank you Mibbit
<drf|work> it's supposed to say Espeon (IP here) has joined #SW
<drf|work> but nooo
<drf|work> it has to do it that way
<Bloodari> haha wow
<Bloodari> just got all connected
<Bloodari> gettin 1mb down
<drf|work> at least it shows it >_>
<Airwolve> it's speshul.
<Bloodari> thats awesome
*drf|work still prefers mIRC any day of the week
<Bloodari> much better than torrents
<drf|work> if only port 6667 wasn't blocked here :|
<RuPeRt> less c how many bad rls u get
<RuPeRt> and waste download time
*Stryker wakes up, bleeding.

<[NiNjA]UK> hey guys , heres a otn of working confirmed wii game release > http://bit.ly/a1NrIH < I upload them myself, and have tested them ALL
<RuPeRt> ur a noob fuck stick
<drf|work> LOL at the ability to not show joins, parts, etc
<drf|work> that would make for a very akward chat.
<Perseid> Bloodari: Ignore the troll. You'll be fine.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Lol.
<drf|work> OK, I did a factory reset
<[NiNjA]UK> lol
<RuPeRt> troll
<Bloodari> alrighty

<Shadow_Lugia> 6Lol.
<drf|work> I might need to make a second account

<drf|work> I wonder where it stores said logs?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6The tab that says Logs, of course.

<Stryker> I've seen better. :O
<drf|work> ah
<drf|work> You have 0 lines of Chat logged. <-- WTF?

Where the group nominate someone who has done something stupid on the previous day, for the award of donut for that particular day. Although mainly used for stupidity, be it verbal or physical, great stacks can also result in being nominated DOTD. The person nominated DOTD wears a high visibility
<True_ai> 04vest for the day, with the words 'Donut of the Day' clearly visable, and below this a list of the weeks winners and their instances of stupidity. At the end of the holiday, a 'Donut of the Week/Trip' may be awarded, from the previous winners, with the overall winner keeping the vest.

*Andres thought that he was gentle ._.
<Stitch> Good.
<Stitch> Servers on windows is just....
<Curly> my computer's terrible anyway though
*Stitch shivers.
<Corevette789> What RAM is needed
<Hyperiant> okay so
<Corevette789> ~10 GB
<Stitch> Not much at all. Maybe 3MB.
<Curly> it shouldn't really matter for a small server
<Tarcis> hey is it posible for a wii to read a certain media (niponic) that another wii cant read (disc error) ?
<Hyperiant> I've got this micro SDHC card which I've been using with my Wii for a while
<Corevette789> I have >!
<Corevette789> >1 898 MB
<Corevette789> :(
<Hyperiant> Trying to use it to add homebrew channel
<Corevette789> And XP lol
<MuzerNtbk> right
<Curly> I think I have 500mB of ram
<Hyperiant> Unfortunately: A) I don't know what it's formatted as
*Andres has a sleep.
<MuzerNtbk> A) It's very likely FAT, so you should be fine - if it doesn't work, though, try reformatting
<Corevette789> Curly, really?
<Curly> mmhm
<BenGrimm> yes
<Curly> it's an upgrade from my last computer
<Corevette789> You could buy a nice box o' RAM
<Curly> it had 256mB
<Hyperiant> B) None of my usual card readers will accept it, but my phone works with it, so file transfers are possible, if grueling--is this a problem?
<Curly> I don't has money
<Corevette789> My other one had 112MB
<Curly> how long ago did you have that?
<Hyperiant> I mean, I've installed WiiWare software on it from my console so obviously it works
<Corevette789> ~3 years
<Corevette789> Then I got a laptop
<Corevette789> (eew)
<Curly> I want a laptop
<Soyuz> o3o
<Curly> so I can lay down in bed and chat :D
<Andres> This one had 256MBs at first D:
<MuzerNtbk> B) Shouldn't be a problem
<Andres> Then I added a 1GB stick.
*Stitch pokes RegistrationAristeo
<Andres> And then I added a 512MB stick!
<MuzerNtbk> but why can't your usual readers accept it?
<MuzerNtbk> that's a little odd
<Runix> mishaps with websites, always fun to fix, but never to eat D:
<MuzerNtbk> do none of them support SDHC?
<Curly> my brother's computer has 2*500mB with 2 free slots
<Curly> I should upgrade that :I
<Hyperiant> I haven't been able to figure that out yet, so far I'm blaming it on faulty readers, I haven't tested them with other cards yet
<Stitch> I only have 2 slots. :(
<Hyperiant> But I've had two that just freeze up My Computer when I try to read the drive the SDHC card is in
<Hyperiant> When I unplug them they tell me it needs to be formatted
<MuzerNtbk> :/
<Hyperiant> Probably don't support SDHC
<MuzerNtbk> yeah
<Aeroslash> XD
<Aeroslash> isn't that the truth? X3
*Curly goes to get ready
<Hyperiant> Anyway, I've got file transferring working but it is a pain
<Sonic41> Oh, on the CustomizeMii thingy, does it matter if the .dol is named boot.dol?
<Sonic41> Sorry to interrupt
<y007ghg7> :|
<Hyperiant> It's cool
<Stitch> jasperdett, you missed the netsplit.
<MuzerNtbk> Hyperiant, I don't know if modern methods require the archive bit set or not
<hunterm> Sonic41: no
<Corevette789> I want to boot up my old Black Compaq with a spare HD I have and a 8GB RAM upgrade
<MuzerNtbk> that could have been a problem with the TP hack
<y007ghg7> /msg djp fix ur fucking connection
<MuzerNtbk> but I don't know if Bannerbomb needs it
<Corevette789> http://www.pcworld.com/article/23867/dell_dimension_v333c.html
<MuzerNtbk> some phones might unset it
<Corevette789> Thats the one I was using for years
<Corevette789> Before I was born
<Tarcis> thanks, i thought i did something wrong
<Hyperiant> I'm planning on using Smash Stack if I can
<Corevette789> Now I have the ORIGINAL Copaq Presario, a desktop
<Sonic41> Okay, done with it, hunterm? Now, what's the LEGAL way of installing this?
<Sonic41> *hunterm.
<Sonic41> Period needed to end that first sentence
<MuzerNtbk> Hyperiant, OK, pretty sure that will need archive bit set
<hunterm> Sonic41: ok, load up the homebrew channel.
<MuzerNtbk> actually, no
<hunterm> make sure you have wireless
<MuzerNtbk> as it doesn't use a savegame
<MuzerNtbk> lol
<MuzerNtbk> you should be fine
<Sonic41> Okay, loading...\
<jasperdett> lol
<MuzerNtbk> as I say, some phones can unset the archive bit, which causes save games not to show up
<Sonic41> Now what?
<hunterm> now, load up customizemii. it should have two big buttons at the bottom of the window. click send wad.
<Corevette789> they are a laptop series now
<hunterm> then, type in the ip address of the wii
<hunterm> (get it from the hbc)
<hunterm> click send
<hunterm> then, it should be transferred to the wii, and load up an installer.
<Hyperiant> I'm assuming I'm running SM 4.3 but I really have no clue
<Hyperiant> I probably have to restore before I can do anything
<Hyperiant> It's set to auto-update at the moment
<MuzerNtbk> Hyperiant, you can find out from the top-right corner of the settings menu
<RedDragonX> http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/07/code-cracked-cyber-command-logos-mystery-solved/?npu=1&mbid=yhp
<MuzerNtbk> there is no "auto update" option; you must always confirm every update
<RedDragonX> LaptopAristeo: http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/07/code-cracked-cyber-command-logos-mystery-solved/?npu=1&mbid=yhp
<Hyperiant> I forget what it's called
<Hyperiant> The 24/7 thing
<Sonic41> What about "IOS to use for installation?" Leave it blank? Or put in 36?
<LaptopAristeo> Back!
<LaptopAristeo> ish
*Stitch points to RegistrationAristeo
<hunterm> do you have a trucha'd 36?
<Corevette789> Check this one out
<Sonic41> Yup
<LaptopAristeo> :o
<Hyperiant> Alright, 4.2U
<hunterm> use that
<MuzerNtbk> Hyperiant, wiiconnect24
<MuzerNtbk> that still doesn't update
<MuzerNtbk> :D
<MuzerNtbk> don't update to 4.3
<MuzerNtbk> 4.2 is GOOD
<MuzerNtbk> lol
<Articuno> 12Gotta go bed.. too late.
<MuzerNtbk> you can install the homebrew channel with it
<Articuno> 12Night and seeya tomorrow

<hunterm> good, i was just about to say: "well then, suck it"
<Sonic41> Let's see what it did
<Sonic41> Oh hay, it installed
<Sonic41> I didn't bother with the banner
<Hyperiant> card loaded
<Hyperiant> I feel stupid, I don't know where to start
<Sonic41> :\ I can't exit it via the Home button
<Hyperiant> Pasted the bannerbomb private folder into the card
<MuzerNtbk> Hyperiant, right, go into the SD Menu
<Sonic41> Let's just test an app here...
<Hyperiant> I think I need something else on the card
<lbiza> can sum1 send me some nl links for tiger 011-ProCiSiON
<lbiza> it would be greatly appreciated

<toagac> yeah
<Sonic41> Oh, rosch fixed it
<Sonic41> But
<Sonic41> It's a new version (obviously)
<Sonic41> :P
<MuzerNtbk> Hyperiant, find the boot.elf or boot.dol
<toagac> it's not up on the HBB from what I can see
<MuzerNtbk> and put it on your SD in the root
<Hyperiant> Alright, found boot.elf
<MuzerNtbk> great, put that in the root of your SD
<Hyperiant> Got it so far
<toagac> I have confirmed that I have the latest version that is up on the HBB
<Skylands> 10Oh yay, more rain coming -_-
<SpooKy> lol
<zeze> !rules
<IOS61> zeze: You are now being sent the rules. Please check for a tab/window/button labelled 'IOS61'
<toagac> Why was IOS61 chosen for the rule bot?
<Hyperiant> why not IOS80
*toagac refers to wiibrew
<Hyperiant> I guess IOS61 was their favorite
<toagac> If my browser will ever come up
<Hyperiant> http://wiibrew.org/wiki/IOS61
<Hyperiant> That should speed things up
<toagac> lol hopefully
<Creideiki> Good relative evening people.
<toagac> IOS 80 is the unknown. They want to have the rules know. there's you 3 seconds explination as to why they havn't chosen IOS 80 :p
<drfsupercenter> 03my evening is not relative.
<zeze> toagac
*drfsupercenter hides
<SheenaFox> It's still afternoon here XD
<zeze> you are smart

<Hyperiant> Hehehehe
<zeze> hhehehehehehe
<Hyperiant> well
<toagac> :p
<Hyperiant> Doesn't IOS80 kill HBC?
<Hyperiant> IOS80 is the devil
<Hyperiant> Probably the name of banhammer bot
<zeze> hbsc is bank
<Sonic41> lol
<Stitch> o.o
<zeze> TOAGAC are you maori
<zeze> make HAKA for us
<toagac> *blinkblink*
<lbiza> ok heres the deal
<lbiza> i need to find out what version i have for wii
<Creideiki> It's evening (or approximately evening) where I am so, therefore it is relative.
<lbiza> so i can softmod it before i even go looking for 011-PROCiSION
<sexual> just look in the wii settings
<lbiza> im kinda jumpin the gun here
<zeze> maoris are angry
<lbiza> ok
<lbiza> ill do that
<lbiza> im a complete n00b sorry
<toagac> "Because unauthorized channels or firmware may impair game play or the Wii console, updating to Wii Menu version 4.3 will check for and automatically remove such unauthorized files"
<Sonic41> "Index (zero based) must be greater than or equal to zero and less than the size of the argument list." CustomizeMii is spitting that at me. What does that mean? :P
<toagac> Good thing system menu =/= firmware
<Sonic41> :P Exactly
*Curly sweats
<Curly> hoot
<toagac> good job ninty. You screwed up your update message like you screw everything else up

*Curly defeats the water
<Sonic41> "This is illegal, you know"
<Curly> also 28% humidity?
<Curly> wow
*Andres did not have that in mind actually D:
<Curly> that must be a record for Vancouver
*Andres just thought of halping the Curly defeat the temperature without ruining her makeup D:
<zeze> hi everybody
*Curly is having a hard time imagining someone pouring water on a girl's chest without having naughty thoughts about it
<toagac> I sometimes wonder if the people who work on the wii system menu intentionally mess stuff up so they have a job to do instead of just getting unpaid leave or something
<Andres> My mind is too absent to have thoughts about things D:
<Curly> suuuure it is :p
<Sonic41> lolwut
<Andres> The Curly does not believe the Andres? D:
<Curly> no she does not :O
<jasperdett> wb LaptopAristeo
<LaptopAristeo> THanks :)
<Andres> Wai? :x
*Curly still wonders if Ari's being DDoSed
<LaptopAristeo> xD
<LaptopAristeo> Just hopping on someone's connection
<LaptopAristeo> <3 people with "linksys" router names
<jasperdett> * +LaptopAristeo (aristeo@EBC82D.F547D6.1B4ABC.BAAA29) Quit (A TLS packet with unexpected length was received.)
<Hyperiant> Actually, beta testing is a lot about trying to break something
<Curly> yeah, that was happening all day yesterday too
<toagac> I also wonder if ninty would have acted on the homebrew scene as soon as they did because of datel bringing the hacks to "common people" (region free disc, was it?)
<Curly> because Andres :O *thinks that's a sufficient answer*
<Sonic41> Their Freeloader disc?
<Sonic41> I dunno
<toagac> yeah
*LaptopAristeo is on a different IP
<LaptopAristeo> That's because I'm using SSL
<Sonic41> Nintendo should've listened to TT
<toagac> Beta? I break stuff ALL the time. I seem to have a nose for screwing stuff up
<LaptopAristeo> Just something silly with Insp 2.0
<Hyperiant> Throughout my life I've broken a PC about once a year on average
<Andres> Mrr
<Runix> hmm
*Curly hugs Andres
<Curly> I'm just kidding D:
<Hyperiant> From birth
<Crisco> what type of b reak?
<Creideiki> It's 19:07 here.
<jasperdett> hehe LaptopAristeo i like when my neighbors have their wifi open even when they have roadrunner
<toagac> More breaking code, causing it to crash, make games unplayable, ect
<Andres> Mrm.
<Crisco> physical or software?
<Creideiki> Also, this is epic: http://supermariobroscrossover.com/ LO
<LaptopAristeo> xD
<Creideiki> :s/LO/LOL
<Creideiki> Super Mario... with several other NES game characters... like, Link, the Contra Guy, Samus...
<Hyperiant> software
<Stryker> I do not like this game. D:
*Stryker cries.
<LaptopAristeo> Stryker: Use VATS :x
<Sonic41> "Index (zero based) must be greater than or equal to zero and less than the size of the argument list." CustomizeMii is spitting that at me. What does that mean?
<toagac> Remind me what customizemii does
<Sonic41> It allows one to create a custom channel,
<Sonic41> hunterm recommended it to me for making a LoadMii channel
<Sonic41> For future use if I decide to update to 4.3
*Curly checks the time
<Curly> got to go >.>
<Curly> bye!
<Stryker> D:
*Stryker clings to Curly.
*Curly hugs Stryker
<toagac> Does 4.3 break custom channels
<toagac> ?
<hunterm> no
<Stryker> "Go on, before security comes!" She says as they bash my head in. ._.;
<Stryker> I hate Bethesda.
*Stryker forces Curly to stay.
<Hyperiant> 4.3 would break the LoadMii channel I think
<Stryker> :o
<Hyperiant> maybe not
<Hyperiant> but it breaks pretty much everything else
<toagac> Prolly not
<toagac> ninty never thinks of the small things
<Sonic41> This error is starting to get on my nerves
<toagac> Does customize me use .net?
<hunterm> what's wrong?
<hunterm> yes
<Sonic41> "Index (zero based) must be greater than or equal to zero and less than the size of the argument list."
<LaptopAristeo> Hehe
<hunterm> GTFOI
<hunterm> (GET THE FUCK OVER IT
<Andres> Bai, Curly :o
<Sonic41> lol, okay okay
<toagac> mrow
<Corevette789> I wish I could easily upgrade a GB of RAM
<Mark0990> Guys can somebody help

*Skylands returns the hug
<|Shadow|> and follow the guide
<[Hideki]> _DiGiTaL_, is that the genesis emulator?
<Sonic41> ...
<_DiGiTaL_> yeah but apparently it doesnt suppose some common files
<_DiGiTaL_> like SMS and such
<Soyuz> ohai drake
<[Hideki]> well, I'd be kinda surprised if it did
<Drake> 04ohai Soyuz
<[Hideki]> given the SMS is the master system, not the genesis...
<Soyuz> how you o3o
<dupasugl> isnt the next ds going to be 3d with no glasses?
<[Hideki]> I know fusion does both but that's more the exception than the rule
<_DiGiTaL_> yeah but there was on on xbox a while back that did them all
<_DiGiTaL_> so was seeing if wii had one similar
<Drake> 04good
<Drake> 04you?
<LaptopAristeo> Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
<ramo34> hey shadow
<|Shadow|> _DiGiTaL_, genesis isnt sms
<[Hideki]> SMSPlus for SMS/GG on Wii
<|Shadow|> sms is sega master system the 8-bit system before the genesis
<|Shadow|> genesis is 16-bit
*NightHawk hoses LaptopAristeo
<[Hideki]> yes, we just had this conversation, lol
<dupasugl> yeah sms had shinobi
<lbiza2> ok i got it online
<lbiza2> i dont wanna update right?
<ramo34> have you guys heard any new news on the gc loader for wii
<Drake> 04ah bugger I need to go
<CZroe> |Shadow|: Ibiza said he had a wep key.
<Soyuz> meh at most, just watching Lelouch
<Soyuz> and LOL bye Xd
<_DiGiTaL_> i know which is which
<dupasugl> i didnt get a genesis until SFII championship edition came out
<lbiza2> ok i changed it to wep
<CZroe> It stands to reason that he's already using wep
<_DiGiTaL_> i was asking if there was an emulator for teh wii that did them all
<lbiza2> i dont update the system right?
<dupasugl> then i got the cool 6 button controller
<_DiGiTaL_> there is one on xbox that did them all
<CZroe> Also, only some routers use 192.168.1.1
<|Shadow|> _DiGiTaL_, there is emu for each
<ramo34> which emulator was that digtital
<|Shadow|> on wii
<EvilClone> lbiza2: no updateign is bad
<CZroe> Also, though wep is easily cracked, it's not nearly the same as "removing protection"
<lbiza2> evil thanks fuck me
<_DiGiTaL_> im have to check xbins but it did support all the major sega platforms
<lbiza2> is there a way in the sys to turn "updating" off permanently
*|Shadow| fucks lbiza2
<LaptopAristeo> Argentum! :D
<LaptopAristeo> Hehe, you're back :D
<LaptopAristeo> :o
<|Shadow|> lbiza2, jsut ge tthe guide going
<|Shadow|> no more questions from u
<|Shadow|> get to softmodding
<LaptopAristeo> :D
<viince> use priiloader to block online and disc updates
*LaptopAristeo wonders if that means Miss Argentum is back :3

<dupasugl> i see that but u cant realy see the actual 3d on it
<|Shadow|> dupasugl, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPPCvVmx5Ho&feature=related <-yea i seen that months ago and the sad thing is its only jap dsiware
<|Shadow|> fuckers
<Hyperiant> Exception (DSI) occured!
<Hyperiant> what the heck
<Hyperiant> Homebrew Browser is mean
<dupasugl> what do u mean its only jap dsi ware?
<lbiza2> softmod for 4.2SD is downloading now
<essex[sX]> hbb... meh
<lbiza2> and i have a boner
<|Shadow|> _DiGiTaL_, dont get the 2 confuzed
<y007ghg7> lol
<lbiza2> im gonna put this shit on the SD card
*Evil0ne Slaps lbiza2 Around A Bit With A Large Half Chicken Half Cow
<|Shadow|> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPPCvVmx5Ho&feature=related is disware witch is avalible in japan dsiware shop now
*lbiza2 slaps Evil0ne mom's ass with my bare hands
<y007ghg7> O_O
<Hyperiant> STACK DUMP and CORE DUMP
<Hyperiant> that doesn't look good
<|Shadow|> dupasugl, yes
<lbiza2> its been xtracted on the SD card!
<Athenon> code dump*
<|Shadow|> jappan DSiWare only
<Hyperiant> oh
<|Shadow|> do u not understand
<y007ghg7> ._.
<Hyperiant> yes i suppose a core dump would be strange for a wi i
<|Shadow|> DSiWare is region lockled
<Hyperiant> *wii
<hunterm> press the reset button on the wii
<Hyperiant> k, pressed
<Hyperiant> Brought me back to Homebrew Channel
<[Hideki]> is it? I must have just not hit anything outside my region then
<LaptopAristeo> Alright, on my way home
<[Hideki]> oh, dsi
<[Hideki]> never mind
<|Shadow|> n00bs
<|Shadow|> cant read today [Hideki]
<Hyperiant> So how do I fix this very scary-looking error message
*NightHawk freeze LaptopAristeo where he's at
<[Hideki]> I never can at 1:30am particularly well
<NightHawk> now u won't be on ur way home :P
<Athenon> you dont is the simple answer
<Sonic41> The author of the program does
<[Hideki]> plus I've been desining a website for most of the day and that always turns my brain to cotton wool
<|Shadow|> LOL
<|Shadow|> yea
<_DiGiTaL_> no i did not get the 2 confused
<essex[sX]> snap!
<_DiGiTaL_> since 1 game is 3d and not a 3DS
<essex[sX]> what you need hbb for anyhow?
<Hyperiant> so much for browser being a good app
<_DiGiTaL_> he was confused
<Hyperiant> I dunno, someone recommended
<[Hideki]> it's boring shit but it'll likely get me a ps3 so I'll put up with it
<Athenon> hbb is nice...i like it..........when it works
<|Shadow|> true
<tpw_rules> yup
<|Shadow|> whatever pays the bills u know
<Sonic41> Agreed
<_DiGiTaL_> [Hideki] have you looked into the JRPG Ps3 game at all ?
<essex[sX]> once you'd done a run-through of it's offering you don't really need it
<Sonic41> Oh wow, lukegb's got more stuff in his repo
<[Hideki]> I don't have a PS3 yet, lol, but FF:XIII might well get bought so it's not in crappy resolution
<_DiGiTaL_> I played FF13 on 360 i dont like it
<_DiGiTaL_> and not because of the graphics
<_DiGiTaL_> the game is boring as hell
<_DiGiTaL_> and the maps are so linear
<[Hideki]> hrm, apparently it picks up later on
<_DiGiTaL_> Straight line mapping is WEAK
<[Hideki]> but I dunno, I've not liked the linear nature of recent ones tbh
<_DiGiTaL_> yeah like 40 hours later
*[Hideki] glares in the direction of crisis core
<[Hideki]> bought a PSP for that one
<[Hideki]> you'd think I'd learn
<essex[sX]> what do you mean by that?
<Sonic41> In the settings, you can change the repository from which you can download homebrew
<_DiGiTaL_> i havent booted my PSP in months and when i did boot it that was to update firmware for no damn reason at all
<Sonic41> I just so happen to have it set to go to lukegb's repo
<_DiGiTaL_> PSP is probably teh worse handheld i have ever owned
<_DiGiTaL_> and without homebrew it would have never made it this long
<[Hideki]> ah, never had a wonderswan crystal then
<[Hideki]> or an original GBA
<[Hideki]> or a GBC come to taht
<_DiGiTaL_> I had a wonderswan but i dont count that since i returned it to play-asia
<_DiGiTaL_> i told them it didnt work when really it just sucked
<[Hideki]> I don't like non backlit colour screens
<_DiGiTaL_> Gamegear was before its time sadly :(
<[Hideki]> you need to be outside in the middle of summer before they work
<[Hideki]> I had one of those as a teenager
<[Hideki]> but it cost a fortune to keep it fed
<[Hideki]> and yes, I know there were NiCads but they didn't last long compared to alkaline batteries
<lbiza2> once im done modding can i turn back to WPA2-Personal?
<lbiza2> my network is unsecure now
<essex[sX]> in hbb?
<Sonic41> Yup
<essex[sX]> no shit?
<Sonic41> Oh
<[Hideki]> yes, just think of all the people lurking in the shadows with their laptops, waiting to steal your bandwidth
<essex[sX]> i mean... does hbb have default locations to check or do you input an address?
<Growlithe> !silence
*Skylands says "BREAK THE SILENCE!!!!!!!"
<Sonic41> It has default ones to check
<essex[sX]> so lukegb's is already built into hbb?
<Sonic41> Yup
<Sonic41> It's already built in
<lbiza2> Afterwards, insert the SD Card into the Wii. A Pop up saying Load boot.dol/elf? should appear. Select Yes. this part didnt come up?
<Arcanine> 04!balloon
<y007ghg7> D: _DiGiTaL_ died
<essex[sX]> i should check that out
<|Shadow|> lbiza2, 4.1 or 4.2?
<Sonic41> It's awesome
<Sonic41> I dunno if you can add more repos
<essex[sX]> i have to download the new version... auto-update is broken on mine for some silly reason
<Sonic41> That sucks
<essex[sX]> yeah, it's odd
<Sonic41> What error does it give when doing that?
<Quilava> ?
<essex[sX]> hold on, just got a new sdhc card, gonna copy contents from old card then check it out
<essex[sX]> hey, you know if there is a list of what the best configuration of IOS's to have installed on your wii is?
<essex[sX]> or does it not matter?
<Sonic41> I don't think so. It's usually best to have the latest revisions of all your IOSes
<essex[sX]> that's what i would've thought
<Sonic41> :O I just thought of something... I can say that I can brick the Wii and never repair it to my siblings as a threat... But that'd be mean.
<Sonic41> :3
<essex[sX]> you have to follow through with it
<Tarcis2> you did it the wrong way ibiza
<essex[sX]> to show'em you mean business
<Tarcis2> follow exactly as said
<Hyperiant> Install an application that automatically boots the Wii into Never Gonna Give You Up looped unless you input Konami Code
<Tarcis2> you probably went in the wrong menu
<lbiza2> should i prepare the bootmii as an SD card
<Sonic41> Does such an app exist?
<Sonic41> XD
<essex[sX]> oh man
<essex[sX]> that's a good idea
<essex[sX]> what's the dev chan?
<lbiza2> i dont think my sys could boot it as 'boot2'
<lbiza2> or w/e
<ramo34> hey shadow what is the easiest way to install dls for guitar hero 5
<Sonic41> Hmmm
<Hyperiant> It doesn't exist, but there's apps that run apps at startup I believe
<Sonic41> Perhaps I could try to make an app like that
<essex[sX]> i have a request for an app
<Sonic41> I am still learning C++, and that could be a project
<|Shadow|> no clue
<|Shadow|> ramo34
<essex[sX]> and i don't know why no one has made it yet
<lbiza2> i inst bootmii an IOS and installed homebrew channel
<Sonic41> I dunno HOW I could make it though
<Tarcis2> you should prepare the card
<essex[sX]> all the program would do is completely shut your wii down (so the light on the power button is red)
<Sonic41> lololol
<lbiza2> ok so i inst homebrew and bootmii but i should also prepare the card too right?
<AndrewH> what card
<AndrewH> my birthday card
<lbiza2> SD card
<lbiza2> fuck u i was talkin to tarcis fuckin troll
<essex[sX]> i'm serious. i have an external hdd hooked up to my wii and the stupid hdd activity light wont shut off until the wii is completely powered down
<AndrewH> u should format your sd to proper FAT, thats about all the prep there is
<essex[sX]> the only way i know to get it to do that is to walk up to the wii and hold down the power button the front of it
<AndrewH> i have a Q...
<|Shadow|> STFU
<|Shadow|> lbiza2, dont listen to AndrewH
<lbiza2> i know i dont
<lbiza2> i was tryin to get tarcis or ur attn
<lbiza2> but i have to see what lebron is doin @ 7
<lbiza2> so i may have to put this mod shit on hold
<AndrewH> I want to use the wii shop channel, but it tells me i HAVE to update to use it, is there a way around this? i just want free demos
<Sonic41> Eh, I've never had to use it
<|Shadow|> AndrewH, just downlaod the full wad's of the games and install them
<|Shadow|> wad manager
<Sonic41> Wow, the SuperTux Wii Edition game is awesome
<lbiza2> should i 'prepare the SD card'
<|Shadow|> yes
<lbiza2> k
<essex[sX]> it sucks. i sleep in the same room as my wii. so i have a bright blue light coming from my hdd if i don't fully power down my wii.
<essex[sX]> what is that?
<lbiza2> cuz i already ins homebrew chan and the other thing
<Soyuz> wb
<Altair> ty
<AndrewH> wad manager, sounds like a porno title
<lbiza2> the only thing i didnt do is DVDx and i have a feeling thats just for ripping shit
<tpw_rules> Sonic41: yes
<|Shadow|> u need to prep as hackmii installer tells u to for bootmii
<Sonic41> :O
<Sonic41> Go download it nao
<Hyperiant> Do I need the USB 2.0 thing do be able to play DVDs on MPlayer CE or just DVDx?
<Skylands> 10Hiya Altair :>
<Sonic41> For MPlayerCE, I believe you can use DVDx
<essex[sX]> anyone use wiiMC?
<Sonic41> I do
<Sonic41> :D
<[Hideki]> lol, |Shadow| proved correct
<Hyperiant> cIOS 202 specifically
<Altair> Hiya Shiny ^^'
<tpw_rules> Sonic41: have you tried Smashing!?
<Altair> Hiya Icey as well XD
<[Hideki]> people really don't know what it's for
<essex[sX]> you ever had a problem with the audio not syncing with dvd?
<Sonic41> Smashing?
<Icey> hio
<tpw_rules> yes
<tpw_rules> awesome arcade target shooter
<tpw_rules> actual 3d!
<|Shadow|> [Hideki], in reference to what?
<Sonic41> :O
<tpw_rules> not open source though :'(
<Sonic41> Gimme link nao
<Hyperiant> Should I download r590 or 0.76
<Sonic41> Awww
<Sonic41> (
<Hyperiant> I have a feeling 0.76 is more stable
<Sonic41> *:(
<[Hideki]> dvdx, you questioned me about it a week or two ago
<tpw_rules> http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Smashing!
<RegistrationAristeo> Back!
<tpw_rules> watch the video
<|Shadow|> if they cant read will fuck em
<y007ghg7> >talking about dubstep
<y007ghg7> <drac> its like random noises thrown into a blender and put on 'NUKE' setting
<Skylands> 10Huh? Shiny? XD
*Skylands is not Shiny
<[Hideki]> sounds like aphex twin
<Sonic41> Holy crap
<essex[sX]> wow
<Sonic41> That looks AWESOME
<RegistrationAristeo> :D
<essex[sX]> that is really polished
<tpw_rules> mmhmm :D
<Hyperiant> haha nice
<Soyuz> ohai icy
<Sonic41> That's WiiWare quality right there
<Icey> hio again
<tpw_rules> indeed
<Kenshou`> Lebron
<Hyperiant> independent game designers have admirable coding abilities and drive
<Hyperiant> If you hired say fifty of them for a designing army you could churn out the best games ever on a regular basis
<Hyperiant> Turn an unrecognized indie brand into a fully-realized corporate giant
<essex[sX]> a lot of indie developers aren't on a schedule like a regular enterprise is
<Hyperiant> but it wouldn't be fun anymore
<Creideiki> Has any one here ever played any of the old King's Quest series of games?
<Creideiki> Number V is driving my nuts because of this one damn puzzle.
<lbiza2> heres the deal
<Sonic41> Yah
<lbiza2> im gonna prepare the SD card
<essex[sX]> i wish there was a wiiware version of netflix
<Hyperiant> YES
<Soyuz> whats up :O
<lbiza2> im a little slow cuz im seein wtf lebron james is gonna do
<essex[sX]> instead of having to load it off the stupid disc
<Sneas> 03Hewwo o.o
<dupasugl> dubstep is drums and echos
<lbiza2> too much stupid suspense just tell me already
<Hyperiant> I wish there was a WiiWare version of Pandora
<Hyperiant> speaking of which
<essex[sX]> i'm on pandora right now
<Icey> nothing much
<Hyperiant> Is there a homebrew Pandora client
<nbp> hyperdub or go home
<Hyperiant> that would be beautiful
<dupasugl> im all about jungle
<Sonic41> I don't think so
<Sonic41> But it DEFINITELY would be possible
*Quilava squeaks.
<Sonic41> :( HBB frose
<Creideiki> "Stupid cat... stop eating the rat before I can type 'throw boot'!" or "Stupid cat... stop eating the rat before I have the boot." or "Stupid cat... stop eating the mouse when I enter from the wrong side of the screen!"
<Sonic41> *froze
<tpw_rules> curse and reset
<Glacymr> 12o-o
<Hyperiant> I tried running Pandora in the Opera browser on the Wii
<Hyperiant> said not enough memory
<Sonic41> ****ing thing doesn't work
<Sonic41> Okay, resetting
<Sonic41> There
<|Shadow|> with or without lebron u seem like your going at the same speed
<|Shadow|> witch is SLOW
<Sonic41> I've read too much WiiBrew wiki
<Sonic41> I know too much
<Sonic41> lol
<Hyperiant> I want an app that will run Brawl when I use Smash Stack
<Hyperiant> So I'll use the stack
<Hyperiant> And infinitely loop
<carrington> hey guys
<Sonic41> You want it to infinitely stack and smash? :3
<Hyperiant> Yes
<Hyperiant> And a visual representation of the Brawl logo exploding and rebuilding
<EFAILGUY> is the homebrew channel in a downloadable and installable version anywhere?
<Sonic41> lol
<carrington> whats up SR
<|Shadow|> yes
<nbp> whats that mean
<Sonic41> It's a shame that the Twilight Hack never got out of beta
<Sonic41> :3
<|Shadow|> www.bootmii.org
<|Shadow|> get the hackmii installer
<EFAILGUY> i grabbed that
<EFAILGUY> can that run from the homebrew chan somehow? [older version]
<|Shadow|> ok install it then
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Hey, those old Sierra games are like that.
<Hyperiant> How come when I load MPlayer CE it's cut off at the top and bottom
<Hyperiant> Wii is set to widescreen, that shouldn't happen
<Sonic41> That's weird
<Sonic41> :P I remember when my little brother and I would have movie night every night after I hacked the Wii
<Creideiki> Also annoying, King's Quest VI... the stupid copy protection puzzle; "No I don't have the ruddy manual... but I do have the original CD... STOP MAKING ME DO COPY PROTECTION JUNK!"
<Sonic41> *I installed homebrew
<Creideiki> (It's the same with LSL2... but luckily there is always Al Lowe's website. :P )
<Quilava> how is people?
<lbiza2> its all about bootmii
<Altair> Tired
<Altair> bored
<Altair> you know the usual
<y007ghg7> http://imgur.com/627lz.jpg its all about wiimc
<Altair> how is you?
<lbiza2> its all about getting this fuckin thing modded in like 1 hr so i can play super mario galaxy 2
<lbiza2> once i get to the pt of playing should i just use an ext hdd?
<Sonic41> Smashing beats Link's Crossbow Training by a longshot
<lbiza2> or can i load it on SD card?
<y007ghg7> lol
<^Wulfgar^> wiimc is nice...but I prefer my wdtv :P
<Sonic41> *long shot
<lbiza2> WDtV ftw
<y007ghg7> wdtv?
<Creideiki> Although Sierra copy protection is annoying... the games are still hilarious and fun.
<lbiza2> doesnt even buffer my 41gb untouched BR of avatar
<Quilava> ehh, I'm all right. could be better
<Exiles> i'm doing a xbmc ion setup
<Creideiki> (Though... some of the "hunt the pixel" puzzles get old quick.)
<lbiza2> plays that fucker smooth
<lbiza2> and clan
<lbiza2> clean*
<Altair> :/
<Altair> all copy protection is annoying yet easy to fix lol
<Rodney> thats what i have exiles
<essex[sX]> crossbow... longshot...
<lbiza2> ok once my SD card is "prepared" do i need to use the NAND backup?
<Damos> !define flamming
<[TST]Bot> -!- Flm is a Norwegian village with some 500 inhabitants, at the inner end of the Aurlandsfjord, an arm of the Sognefjord. The town is located in the municipality of Aurland, in Sogn og Fjordane county, Norway.
<lbiza2> er back up my NAND
<Aeroslash> fail XD
<Sonic41> lol
<^Wulfgar^> always backup your nand
<|Shadow|> lbiza2, USB HDD FTW!!!
<sexual> you really should just read the damn guide and do it
<Exiles> Rodney, i still have an old xbox
<lbiza2> shadow ur tight :)
<Damos> X3
<Exiles> running xbmc
<lbiza2> im adding u as my "e-buddy" on merk
<lbiza2> whether u like it or not
<Sonic41> Unintended effect, thar
<Sonic41> Smashing should have it's own channel
<Exiles> and then every time i see my pchinterface i wanna puke
<Sonic41> Now THAT would be awesome
<Rodney> exiles i was still using my old xbox on a sd tv i have but the dvd drive finally went out
<lbiza2> however /add is a unknowncommand
<lbiza2> lol
<Exiles> i have 2 boxes
<essex[sX]> there a site for hbb or is it just through wiibrew?
<|Shadow|> ha
<Creideiki> Altair: Not the specific copy protection of old Sierra DOS games... then the copy protection is in game, and requires the manual.
<Sonic41> I think through WiiBrew Only
<Sonic41> *only
<Creideiki> (But otherwise... you can make as many copies of the CD/diskettes as you want. :P )

<essex[sX]> 0.3.8 latest version?
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Sonic41> Yup
<drfsupercenter> 03Commander Keen 6 had copy protection like that
<essex[sX]> cool
<drfsupercenter> 03where you had to put in the name of the character
<drfsupercenter> 03somebody cracked it though XD
<Creideiki> Or you can just play one of Al Lowe's LSL games...
<essex[sX]> also how do i get the common key, do you know?
<Creideiki> Where the copy protection is either... non-existant (LSL1), easy to bypass (LSL2), he gives you the stuff to craxx0rz (all of them).
<Sonic41> Out of your own Wii? Make a NAND dump with BootMii and I believe you can look in the keys.bin file it outputs
<Creideiki> (LSL2: Can be bypassed by using... Al Lowe's birthday as the "phone number" - but you do miss the cutscene, it is a developer's "skipping" tool.)

<^Wulfgar^> backups, yes
<lbiza2> what about ext HDD
<Sonic41> Try v0.76
<^Wulfgar^> you cant play gc on usb hdd unless you drop another $100 on a wode

<xdpirate> ogle Code page, and there was indeed a newer version available, revision 938. I removed the old GX, installed the new one, and tried installing again. This time it doesn't even go to the dialog, it just blinks and returns to the game selection interface. Any ideas on what could be causing this?
*Proto watches you sink to the bottom of the ocean to forever sit there
*LoopyDood can also defy the laws of physics
*LoopyDood punches CorBot anyways
*CorBot turns on water power
*Proto shoots a portal on the moon and at the bottom of the ocean
*CorBot transforms to a moon rover
*Proto notes that with the force of the ocean pressing you down, you shot into space and are floating away

*Proto cuts you in half with a chainsaw and throws you into the sun
<xdpirate> and |Shadow|, the format the drive is in? you mean the USB HDD? it's in WBFS
<sexual> its for "data dvds"
<sexual> like movies etc
<sexual> its just an ios
<xdpirate> aha
<xdpirate> i see
<|Shadow|> xdpirate, CFGLoader FTFW!!!
*CorBot makes burgers on the sun
*LoopyDood cuts the sun in half with a godsaw and reforms it around CorBot
<xdpirate> |Shadow|, cool story bro :P
*CorBot falls asleep
<xdpirate> does cfgloader have a website?
<xdpirate> could only find a thread on gbatemp
<|Shadow|> xdpirate, http://www.sendspace.com/file/3rf94s
<xdpirate> nice
<xdpirate> it supports wbfs right? =)
<|Shadow|> dont be a asshole
*CorBot blows up sun

<Tarcis> how do I install the new shop channel ?
<dupasugl> u lube it up all nice and good and u shove it right in there
<Creideiki> It's kind of funny when you understand the language of a horribly subtited speech and you realize: "Hey! That's not what they're talking about, dumb subtitles..."
<Tarcis> thanks thats helpfull
<dupasugl> i try
<dupasugl> and u spelled helpful wrong
<Tarcis> found searching forums: dop-mii
<drf|laptop> 03what, you mean like the "Hitler [blah]" videos?
<Tarcis> english is not my first language
<dupasugl> ? softmod
<Tarcis> but thanks, ill try to remember that
<Tarcis> =D
<dupasugl> http://sharingmatrix.com/file/1005427/Shopping_Channel-NUS-v18.rar
<dupasugl> this is whats in the 3.1-4.1 guide
<dupasugl> but id say just follow the whole guide
<Tarcis> thanks, but version v18 is old and doesnt work anymore
<Tarcis> its the one I had
<Tarcis> i found that I need to download dop-mii
<Tarcis> and dop-mii will install it for me
<xdpirate> |Shadow|, CFGLoader worked with installing discs to disk, thanks alot :)
<Sonic41> Hmmm, maybe I should brick the Wii every night
<Sonic41> So the siblings can't access it
<Tarcis> All you need to do is install shop channel v19 using dop-mii or wad manager. It works with the old revision of IOS61.
<Tarcis> Dop-Mii -- DOP-Mii Download
<Tarcis> Start HBC - Load Dop-Mii -- Press A at the warning.
<Tarcis> Select IOS249 or 250 --(Use the D-Pad) -- Press A
<Tarcis> Select "Channels" -- Press A
<Tarcis> Install Shopping Channel v19
<Tarcis> If you need the wad File then update your NUSD database and download Shopping channel v19 and select pack to wad.
<Austin> or parental lock ;o
<Sonic41> lol Or that
<Sonic41> :P
<Aeroslash> bye all
<llrcombs> people do all sorts of funny things to keep friends off the wii
<Sonic41> Like bricking? XD
<Ded_> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enHg3XrhsHk ahh memories of playin sega genesis
<Yoshino> 2gtg now
<Yoshino> 2cya guys~
<Tarcis> worked
<max__> how about a homebrew solution that straps onto bootmii, requires a code?
<max__> it'd have to have a cool ui, though
<tpw_rules> cool UIs are boring
<max__> whuuuut. it's the the user experience. a cool program like a wii login should look amazing
<max__> 2.0 gloss and everything
<tpw_rules> i just want a black screen with console text "Enter password: "
<tpw_rules> and it wouldn't even have special glyphs, if you pressed up it would be ^
<tpw_rules> or not even anything, like sudo
<tpw_rules> so the entire UI is one string
<Sonic41> Oh, just a simple button combination?
<tpw_rules> that's my kind of ui :D
<tpw_rules> Sonic41: what else can you do?
<tpw_rules> make it the konami code :P
<Sonic41> lol Oh yeahhhh
<Sonic41> What exactly are you looking for? :P
<Sonic41> If you're talking programming abilities, I can only create functions, if statements, couts, cins
<Sonic41> I somewhat understand do while loops
<max__> what's there to get?
<max__> perform, evaluate, repeat on true, exit on false
<Risugami> if it's true, it loops. not much to it
<Sonic41> D:
<Sonic41> I hate that. It's usually simple, and I make it harder than it needs to be
<max__> for is a bit trickier
<Shadow_Lugia|Zzz> 6AERO
<Shadow_Lugia|Zzz> 6:>
<AeroDrawcohem> O:
<AeroDrawcohem> hello~
<Risugami> basically only want to use while when the outcome cannot be put into a range
<tpw_rules> or when you're looping on a condition
<Shadow_Lugia|Zzz> 6How goes art?
<Sonic41> Oh, I think I understand for
<max__> while ( !succeed ) { try(); }
<tpw_rules> like while (!passwordValid()) {printf("%s", "Invalid password!");}
<tpw_rules> max__: pretty much :P
<max__> that would just print "invalid passord" forever
<rewt> that would be an infinite loop
<AeroDrawcohem> goes good
<AeroDrawcohem> *well
<AeroDrawcohem> or w/e
<AeroDrawcohem> alskdfjakl
<max__> just as much fun, though
<Shadow_Lugia|Zzz> 6ovo
<Shadow_Lugia|Zzz> 6Okay.
<Shadow_Lugia|Zzz> 6How goes that sketch? :>
<AeroDrawcohem> Well, as I've stated before, all the sketch requests are finished. o3o
<Shadow_Lugia|Zzz> 6So...
<max__> I'm waiting for a corrected loop
<max__> I'm on the edge of my seat wondering how it's going to turn out
<Shadow_Lugia|Zzz> 6Where are they? ovo
<AeroDrawcohem> o3o
<tpw_rules> lol
<tpw_rules> s/passwordValid()/checkPass()/
<AeroDrawcohem> I'm not going to upload them today 'cause I'm too lazy/tired too. >_>
<max__> see, passwordValid() must be a dictionary, pulling from a file or a database or something
<AeroDrawcohem> *to
<AeroDrawcohem> dfklasdjflkadsjf
<max__> but then, you'd need an argument to say who you're talking about
<Shadow_Lugia|Zzz> 6T'morrow?
<tpw_rules> it pulls from globals
<tpw_rules> duh :P
<Sonic41> Oh wait, he's ACTUALLY making the app now? :O
<max__> that's dumb
<AeroDrawcohem> I'll upload sometime
<AeroDrawcohem> soon
<Shadow_Lugia|Zzz> 6Okay.
<Shadow_Lugia|Zzz> 6Good night.
<AeroDrawcohem> 'cause I'm still exhausted from that plane flight and I don't really want to think right now
<AeroDrawcohem> 'night
<Shadow_Lugia|Zzz> 6Hey, I was on a plane two days ago. :P
<max__> while ( !passwordValid("tpw_rules")) { AskForPassword(); }
<AeroDrawcohem> that's great O:
<Shadow_Lugia|Zzz> 6And, erm, my internal clock is still off.
<tpw_rules> Sonic41: nope
<max__> and another thing -- you want a pause or a lockout for a certain amount of tries
<tpw_rules> yup
<AeroDrawcohem> well I'll upload whenever I have the motivation to
<max__> otherwise you could have a smart friend with a trick controller that brutes it
<Sonic41> :( Awww. Oh well
<AeroDrawcohem> 'cause right now I just want to relax
<tpw_rules> while (tries < 3) { doPass(); }
<AeroDrawcohem> and I don't want to deal with this scanner now
<tpw_rules> i could hack it into loadmii
<tpw_rules> but not hbc or bootmii
<max__> that's too iterative
<tpw_rules> i don't have the source
<tpw_rules> max__: sorry :P
<max__> yeah
<tpw_rules> i prefer python :D
<max__> sorry, tpw
<max__> your login app sucks
<max__> is bootMii not public source?
<tpw_rules> nope
<max__> I guess that makes sense
<tpw_rules> neither is hbc
<Shadow_Lugia|Zzz> 6Lol.
<tpw_rules> yeh
<max__> probably for the better
<Shadow_Lugia|Zzz> 6I've gotten two things done two days I've returned.
<max__> still...
<Shadow_Lugia|Zzz> 6Gonna complete another thing on my to-do list tomorrow. :>
<max__> they could do some modulary things
<max__> take plugins
<max__> bootMii plugins would be bitchin'
<Sonic41> Hell yeah
*Shadow_Lugia|Zzz 6wants to finish that fanfic. D:
<max__> (login app)
<tpw_rules> that would be really hard to do for bootmii though
<tpw_rules> hbc should be easier
<tpw_rules> actually, just set parental controls on it
<max__> a login app wouldn't have any value on hbc
<max__> or parental controls
<max__> fuck, take the SD card away
<Sonic41> lawl
<max__> omg -- my devkitPro still won't work
<Sonic41> Yeah, taking the SD Card out would probably be the easiet way
<max__> I have all these good ideas, and I can't do anything
<max__> what do you need to build the examples?
<Zen> Hey
<max__> g++/gcc and what's included?
<Argentum> Hello!
<Zen> Sup all?
<tpw_rules> yeah
<tpw_rules> pretty sure
<tpw_rules> i hooked it up to xcode :D
<Proto> teh roof
<Zen> Lol, you and your puns
<Proto> :D
<max__> macfag?
<max__> question -- can you develop for iPhone on Linux?
<tpw_rules> not sure
<max__> (rather, non-Mac platform?)
<Crisco> max__: do you use linux?
<tpw_rules> not sure
<max__> sure do
<hepatitus> sup
<tpw_rules> and i have all 3 operating systems, thank you very much
<callow> yw
<max__> can't develop for shit, but it's my only OS
<tpw_rules> it just so happens that my main computer is a mac (and i like it more :P)
<tpw_rules> i have another compy with linux and windows
<max__> tpw_, I like you
<max__> you seem like a good kid
<tpw_rules> and a windows vm here
<tpw_rules> lolthx
<max__> but the definition of "macfag" is not exclusive of any other software you might happen to own
*Glacymr gives AeroDrawcohem a fork
<max__> (macfag)
<tpw_rules> >_<
<tpw_rules> so just that i happen to own an osx install disc automatically makes me a macfag even if i'm rms?
<max__> uhm.
<max__> no, I suppose not
<Crisco> max__: would you rather have winblows?
<max__> not really
<tpw_rules> it took me about two hours to get my win7 install to recognize my fucking flash drive
<max__> there's nothing outrageously important I'd need it for
<Crisco> good
<Sonic41> lol
<max__> ...
<max__> okay?
<max__> your juudgement is appreciated
<max__> wtf. why won't this shit build.
<tpw_rules> cause it hates you
<tpw_rules> what's the error?
<max__> make 2, n/powerpc-eabi-gcc: 1: Syntax error: "(" unexpected
<tpw_rules> i can has code?
<max__> it's not the code, they're examples
<tpw_rules> can u email me teh codez?? i'm a student and i really needthem. thx
<tpw_rules> oh
<max__> I'm not doing anything
<max__> NO U CAN'T HAZ MAH CODE
<tpw_rules> D:
<max__> >:O
<tpw_rules> yelling is mean :<
<max__> well, uh
<max__> fine.
<max__> I'm sorry, tpw
<tpw_rules> lol
*tpw_rules doesn't really care
<max__> to formalize my apology:
<max__> http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/examples/wii/
<max__> here
<max__> you can haz mah code.
<Crisco> tpw_rules: little boy get outta here
<tpw_rules> Crisco: stfu, i has ops
<max__> WHUT.
<max__> O_O
<Crisco> just cause your twelve doesn't mean you can complain
<tpw_rules> 13 kthx
<Crisco> sorry
<tpw_rules> (true)
<max__> hahaha
<max__> I admire his initiative, then
<Crisco> I'm sorry you turned 13 what a month ago?
<max__> of all the places you can end up in the world
<tpw_rules> talking to random people on the internet?
<max__> a wii development channel on IRC is probably in the top 30
<tpw_rules> i hate people irl though
<max__> see? probably top 10.
<Crisco> now you're only one year younger than me :D
<max__> WTF>
<tpw_rules> Crisco: 2 months
<max__> I NEED A NEW CHANNEL
<tpw_rules> max__: we're filled with youngins
<Crisco> where'd he go?
<lbiza2> ok so http://gwht.wikidot.com/usb-loader which version do i get?
<xdpirate> is there any built-in theme changer in usb loader gx?
<Crisco> ...
<xdpirate> cos i downloaded a theme and it's hideous, now i want the old one back
<Crisco> xdpirate: backups?
<IOS61> Crisco: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
<xdpirate> (the default one)
<Crisco> read the topic@
<xdpirate> technically, usb loader gx is homebrew, i'm not talking about backups
<IOS61> xdpirate: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
<xdpirate> lolwat
<Crisco> tired gay succumbs to dix
<xdpirate> Is there any built-in theme changer in usb loader gx?
<tpw_rules> xdpirate: type !rules
<xdpirate> i've done so before
<Crisco> tpw_rules: when can I haz voice?
<xdpirate> i know the rules
<tpw_rules> dunno
<Crisco> in a year?
<tpw_rules> ask one of the other ops, i can't put you in the bot
<lbiza2> pirate does usb loader gx work ok?
<tpw_rules> xdpirate: srsly, it's backups
<tpw_rules> we won't help you with usbloaders
<tpw_rules> if you do it again, i'll ban you
<lbiza2> i was told to use CFG
<Evil0ne> gx is poop
<xdpirate> lbiza2, i find usb loader gx prettier, that's all
<Crisco> go home and watch your Disney XD
<lbiza2> ok then im gonna continue my quest to finish USB Loader with CFG or w/e
<Crisco> xdpirate: CFG looks better imo
<lbiza2> its just a pain in the ass
<xdpirate> i don't think so =(
<Crisco> it also works alot smoother
<xdpirate> but to reiterate my original question, is there a built-in theme changer with gx?
<xdpirate> or do i manually have to take the sd card back to the pc to delete the theme files?
<Crisco> iirc yes
<xdpirate> where? can't find it =/
<Crisco> I don't know
<lbiza2> alternatively does dvd-r work on wii?
<Crisco> I only use CFG where it's easy to change themes
<xdpirate> lbiza2, dvd-r works if you got an older wii
<lbiza2> crisco what version do i get of CFG?
<Crisco> the latest?
<xdpirate> newer wiis have the D3-2 disc drive which doesn't read burnt cds
<Crisco> I haven't used my wii for a while
<lbiza2> The v57b7-222 .dol?
<Crisco> I only play it when friends are over or when I get a new game
<Crisco> I guess
<lbiza2> ok so once i put hermes on 236 and all that shit and i goto burn on dvd-r can i just use GX loader to load it?
<xdpirate> ah, found a fix on the forums "<xdpirate> is there any built-in theme changer in usb loader gx?"
<xdpirate> oops wrong ctrl v
<lbiza2> or what do i need to do once i put the disc in will it autplay?
<xdpirate> "Change the theme path in the settings to one of the folders that contains a theme"
<lbiza2> or i just play the dvd-r like any other
<lbiza2> as if i rented a game
<xdpirate> lbiza2, if your wii is new, no
<Sonic41> lawl
<xdpirate> new wiis doesn't read dvd-rs
<CorBot> 3 strong supports and a support
<lbiza2> LU39725
<lbiza2> is the beg of my serial
<lbiza2> is that old enuf?
<INVADER_TODD> Hi
<where> You're a strong support.
<lbiza2> ill try it and see what happens
<lbiza2> now, does it need to load from SD everytime i wanna play a game?
*WetBunnyfox cries
<lbiza2> or once the mod is done i can just play fromthe dvdr with no sd card
<Lugianite> 2o.o
*Lugianite offers tissue to WetBunnyfox
*WetBunnyfox eats it

<CorBot> I'm 3/4 strong supports
*Lugianite hms
<where> NOU
<xdpirate> lbiza2, when did you get your wii?
<xdpirate> and if you install usbloader gx as a channel you don't need an sd card, but you'll have no place to store covers
<y007ghg7> i installed as a channel
*Glacymr offers WetBunnyfox a pokeball
<lbiza2> me too
<Evil0ne> vs cfg that u can put on the hdd
<lbiza2> but i can inst both right?
<xdpirate> yes
<SheenaFox|Afk> gonna go eat O:

<Curly> no password?
<lbiza2> im movin it
<lbiza2> im smokin a cig tho
<phenom> I'll tell you what, most if it is common sense for any help channel. When you've been on IRC as long as I have at least.. :P
<lbiza2> and it has 1 minute remaning
<phenom> I figured I'd start there anyways because it IS my first time here. :)
<lbiza2> until the long_ass_filename_is done
<|Shadow|> honkey boy
<Athenon> lol yeah
<Evil0ne> haha
<CorBot> What do I do
<CorBot> Why Am I still CorBot
<Athenon> soooo many people dont read the rules that i want to hug those who do O_O
*Evil0ne points and laughs at the honkey
*phenom just get the homebrew channel loaded, and was in the process of loading the HomeBrew Browser, but it crashed..
<Stitch> Curly: Why put a password?
*where throws a spanner in Corevette789's gears
<phenom> FAQ says to reboot, but that means I need to get up. :)
*Proto steals it
<Proto> I need a spanner wrench
<Proto> thanks
<Athenon> you can reboot from the wiimote
<Curly> um
<Athenon> power button xP
<Curly> to password lock your idle account?
<Athenon> but yeah, homebrew browser crashses a LOT and its not your fault....but you do have to live with it :/
<phenom> So I continued reading the FAQ, and saw there was an IRC channel, so I thought I'd check it out..
<Stitch> ?
<Stitch> Curly: Look at the topic.
<phenom> Apparently the Wiimote's power button is disengaged w/ a code dump on screen. :)
<Curly> oooooh
<Curly> woops
<Curly> I used part of my class name as the password xD
<Curly> so thaat's what happened
<Athenon> oh yeah
<Athenon> code dump = reset button
<Athenon> xP
<phenom> Literally started delving into this a few minutes ago, and I thought I couldn't go wrong with extra chat support. At least for now however, nothing to ask. Printed materials online seem to be sufficent.
<Stitch> Can't have spaces in your class, I think.
<where> hokay, off for real this time
<Athenon> yeah. most people dont even try to read before they start asking xP
*where pats the server and hugs everyone
<Proto> bye where
<Curly> yes you can Stitch
<Curly> I just did it :3
<Stitch> Don't pat dragonite! D<
<Corevette789> Thats awesome!
<Curly> buh bai where
<phenom> I think once I get into HBB I'll be looking for recommendations. I mean, I did it (hacked the wii) but I really don't know where to go from here... so I'll be reading/learning over the next few days I imagine. :)
*Stitch unpats dragonite.
<Athenon> hehe yeah
<Aristeo> I like her
<Athenon> hbb is awesome..............when it works
<Aristeo> Unless where is a guy, and then, I dunno
*Proto pats dragonite repeatedly
<phenom> Yea, I hate people who refuse to RTFM, or some derivative of that..
<Athenon> but thats a HUGE when
<Corevette789> Its a guy
<Curly> well, he said "his"...
*Stitch makes dragonite pat-proof.
<Curly> so I assume he was joking >.>
<Corevette789> He was
<lbiza> shit
<Curly> and I think he was patting you Stitch :p
<Corevette789> Lol
*phenom turns on some music, and give HBB another whirl. :)
<lbiza> my battery died
*Proto slaps dragonite then
*Stitch pats Proto
<Athenon> ja. often itll work upon restart for some unknown reason XD
<Corevette789> Why can I not do this >D
<Stitch> Dragonite's a bully.
*Proto breaks the lego gun
<Proto> don't
<Proto> touch
<Proto> me
<Curly> dragonite's a pushover with an omistar
*Stitch rebuilds it and shoots Proto
<Curly> or however you spell that
*Proto lights it on fire
<Curly> or any ice pokemon >.>
<lbiza> but
<Proto> omnistar iirc
<lbiza> it finished lol
*Curly pats her omnistar from waaaaay back in pokemon yellow
<Curly> destroyed dragonite in one ice beam ^^
<Proto> :O
<Stitch> Dragonite is still a bully.
<Stitch> He bullied shaymin off the network twice now!
<Stitch> I have had to sign Shaymin up for COUNSELING!
<Stitch> >:(
*Proto unplugs shaymin
*Stitch smacks Proto
*Proto explodes
<Stitch> Good. D<
*Curly holds Felix and rubs his tummy like a guitar
<Corevette789> What am I doing wrong?!
<Curly> with what?
<Corevette789> .. /msg IdleRPG register Core pass idler
<Curly> that should be right
<Stitch> Yeah.
<eXAKR> THIS.
<eXAKR> IS.
<lbiza> ok so i extracted that
<Curly> um... I have no idea why that wouldn't work >.>
<eXAKR> MADDENING.
<|Shadow|> why didnt u have the chrarger?
<Curly> /msg idlerpg register Hero <pass> innocent bystander
<Curly> that's exactly what I put in
<Curly> well
<Curly> minus the password
<Evil0ne> battery?
<eXAKR> Restoring this computer is going to take FOREVER
<Glacymr> 12wild eXAKR is happy
<Corevette789> Argh
<Zen> Oh my
<Zen> I missed quite a bit
<Proto> Yes
<Corevette789> Okay I c/p'd and variabed what you did Curly
<Zen> I was listening to, and trying to learn Right Where It Belongs by NIN
<Corevette789> variable'd
*eXAKR bites Glacymr. Hard.
<Glacymr> 12oww
<Curly> argh, mosquito attacking me
*Proto shoos it away
<eXAKR> SO
<Zen> waitaminute
<eXAKR> MANY
<eXAKR> APPS

<Glacymr> 12oww
<Alt|eXAKR> AND I HAVE TO RESTORE THE SETTINGS FOR ALL THEM
<Zen> That makes a lot more sense now
<Curly> hum
*Stitch wants a bellyrub
<Curly> are you friends with Where by any chance? :o
*Proto lights Stitch on fire >_>
*Stitch sits on Proto
<Curly> because I remember someone on cs talking about their friend Felix
*Proto stands up under a fan
*Corevette789 gives up
<Glacymr> 12ask StatsBot for help
<Zen> someone on what?
*Alt|eXAKR runs over StatsBot with a bendy bus
<Curly> another network
<Alt|eXAKR> bbl
<Zen> then no
<Alt|eXAKR> expect to see this housands of times today
<Zen> since I only go to a few
<Zen> and none start with a c
<Glacymr> 12o-o
<Proto> Hai lambda
<Lambda> Hey Proto
*Curly keeps an eye out for mosquitos landing on her shoulders
<Lambda> D:
<Lambda> Mosquitos are evil
<Curly> this isn't so bad though
*Proto sets up an air defense system for #epic-chat
<Curly> in Keremeos if you stood still on a non windy day for 10 seconds like a dozen mosquitos would come at you >_>
<Curly> and some of them actually /stung/
<Curly> which was weird
<Lambda> yeah, I've been a few places like that
<Lambda> hmm, not were they actually stung though
<Curly> they weren't actually stinging
<Curly> but their bites hurt
<Lambda> do the stings itch like the bites do?
<Lambda> ah
<Curly> it feels like a sting
<Curly> sharp and painful >.>
<Proto> heh
<Proto> florida! humidity!
<Curly> and like a dozen would come at you at the same time <_<
<Curly> and I don't think the stinging ones itched
<Curly> probably because they didn't bother injecting you with anything to stop the pain
<Corevette789> What was the mibbit link syntax?
<Lambda> Well at least it doesn't nag at you then like it does when it itches
<Curly> there were lots of non stingy ones up there too >.>
<Curly> some of the mosquito bites swelled up like crazy
<Curly> generally the ones rubbing against my clothes
<Curly> the ones at my ankles and the ones under/near my bra strap were the worst >_>
<EpicStatsGuy> It's eXAKR! Everyone hide before he attacks you with Falcon Punches!
<Lambda> I hate ankle bites
<Lambda> my socks only make the itching worse
<Curly> I think ankle biter was slang for small child in Australian...
<Curly> /random
<Arcanine> 04hi
<Curly> it's a cute idea though :3
<Lambda> lol, did not know that
*Curly noms on the nearest person's ankle and does not let go
<Proto> ow
<Proto> I's got a curleh on my ankle D:
*Curly chews
<Lambda> :O
<Lambda> Poor Proto

<Glacymr> 12is that you eXAKR
*Glacymr hides
<Corevette789> RDX has influenced this channel
<Sonic41> Is anyone using Firefox 4?
*eXAKR divides Glacymr by zero.
<Lambda> nah, I liked it long before I met him
<Glacymr> 12http://delthero.deviantart.com/art/Identity-Crisis-168043962
<Crisco> yeah
<Corevette789> Me too
<Corevette789> Still
<Lambda> interesting coincidence though, I must admit
<Hyperiant> HBB is annoying as heck
<Sonic41> I'm just about to download it
<Hyperiant> I put it on the card
<Hyperiant> Loaded it
<Crisco> for what os?
<Hyperiant> And it died horrifically and I needed to press reset to fix
<Hyperiant> Tried to remove it and it did the same thing
*Stitch curls into a ball and rolls around the room
*Proto plays soccer with Stitch
<Lambda> Droideka!
*Raine saves Stitch
<Sonic41> For Windows
<y007ghg7> lol
<Proto> I was gentle ._.
*Raine kisses Proto's cheek
<Proto> :)
<Raine> see all better!
<Sonic41> Oh my, I'm not used to this
<Proto> heh
<Crisco> used to what?
<Sonic41> Firefox 4
*Stitch rolls over to Raine
<Crisco> it's the same for me...
<Sonic41> Too glassy for me (I'm running Windows 7)
<Stitch> Raine: Did you see the song I made yesterday?
<Crisco> ah
<Crisco> ubuntu here
<Hyperiant> get used to glassy with W7
*Lambda is ready for bed
<Lambda> night everyone
<Hyperiant> That's one of the reasons I still run XP, the Aero thing really bugs me
<Hyperiant> There isn't an easy way to mod XP style back in
<Sonic41> I can stand Aero
<Theguesst> ...
<Sonic41> It's just too much of it
<Sonic41> Can drive me insane
<Glacymr> 12hi

<Crisco> that's one of the best Backgrounds I have
<Proto> o_O
<Glacymr> 12tf2?
<Crisco> aren't you glad I showed it to you :P
<Sonic41> Totally
<Sonic41> :P
<Sonic41> I would show you guys mine
<Crisco> I'm talking to tpw_rules
<Sonic41> O
<Sonic41> *Oh
<Sonic41> lol
<tpw_rules> wai u hate mine D:
<tpw_rules> Sonic41:
<Sonic41> Oh, no
<Sonic41> I like it
<Sonic41> It's just as messy as mine
<Sonic41> :P
<tpw_rules> lol
<tpw_rules> the crap on the edges is where the windows go when i press f11
<tpw_rules> they all go to the sides like the windows desktop reveal
<Sonic41> You should see my Downloads folder
<Sonic41> It's worse
<tpw_rules> no, mine's worse
*tpw_rules gets info
<Crisco> cool you've got a lego NXT too?
<tpw_rules> Size: 17.5 GB on disk (17,326,733,718 bytes) for 71,149 items
<tpw_rules> yes
<tpw_rules> Sonic41: ^
<tpw_rules> that
<tpw_rules> s my downloads folder
<Sonic41> Windows 7 is making it hard for me to find the fucking info
<Sonic41> D:
<Sonic41> Well, I have 365 items in it
<Hyperiant> psh
<tpw_rules> loser
<Sonic41> So, yeah, yours is worse
<Hyperiant> only 17.5?
<Theguesst> Team fortress 2
<tpw_rules> Hyperiant: it was only created in 2009
<Glacymr> 12oh
<Hyperiant> mine was created earlier this year

<Sonic41> Btw...
<Hyperiant> Size on disk: 236 GB (253,512,859,648 bytes)
<Sonic41> Out of 283 GB on this computer
<Sonic41> Only 83 GB are available
<Sonic41> :P
<Hyperiant> haha
<tpw_rules> Capacity: 319.73 GB
<tpw_rules> Available: 41.85 GB
<tpw_rules> on a laptop
<Hyperiant> Used space: 751,729,156,096 bytes (700 GB)
<Sonic41> Yeah, mine is a lappy too
<Sonic41> And damn
<tpw_rules> nice
<Hyperiant> Free space: 248,473,083,904 bytes (231 GB)
<tpw_rules> TB hard driv?
<tpw_rules> my desktop has a 1.5TB
<Hyperiant> terabyte drive and I got 3/4 filled
<Sonic41> Lucky
<tpw_rules> 1TB for linux, 500GB for windows
<tpw_rules> and guess what? it's DUAL PROCESSOR (yeah, doesn't make sense to me either)
<Hyperiant> 1.5s are about the cost of 1s now
<Hyperiant> Mine's single hyperthreaded
<Crisco> I have like 37 gb left on both my partitions
<tpw_rules> it was only 20 bucks more
<Hyperiant> So it's basically dual
<Hyperiant> At least that's what my system thinks
<tpw_rules> nono, the hard drive is dual processor
<Hyperiant> OH
<Hyperiant> Probably the device that manages information runs in tandem with another
<Hyperiant> I have no clue
<tpw_rules> it's also only 5400RPM, which is gay for a desktop drive
<Hyperiant> need at least 72
<tpw_rules> it's 'green' and shit
<Sonic41> :P
<Hyperiant> screw green, PCs in general aren't green
<tpw_rules> duhhh
<Crisco> I'll make a desktop next summer
<Hyperiant> suck up energy, cost a lot to make, ruin the environment
<Hyperiant> might as well make it efficient for the end user
<Crisco> and then I'll game on it
<tr0n> hmm
<tr0n> new cfgloader
<Sonic41> Speaking of which, I need a RAM upgrade for my desktop
<Crisco> good old fashioned games
<tr0n> 57b7
<Hyperiant> I wish I had the money to make a gaming PC
<tr0n> (new to me anyway)
<Sonic41> It's only running on a lowly 384 MB of RAM
<Hyperiant> Best I have is my dying P4 HT

<Hyperiant> anyone remember an ancient intel relic called the pentium 4
<tpw_rules> 2GB of ram
<Crisco> tpw_rules: go to bed too
<tpw_rules> i remember a pentium 2
<tpw_rules> i have a lappy that has it
<Hyperiant> well good
<tpw_rules> it's like a brick
<Hyperiant> you darn kids
<Runix> !twilight
<drf|away> 03EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW JACOB BLACK
<Hyperiant> hahaha
<Hyperiant> I got one too
<Hyperiant> It runs 98 SE
<tpw_rules> some NEC thing
<Runix> !microsoft
<|Shadow|> LOL
<Runix> D:
<Hyperiant> I've played with 486s before
<Hyperiant> At least, emulated 486s
<|Shadow|> wow u finaly relized
<Hyperiant> My dad used to sell ataris, and not the game systems
<|Shadow|> what almost a moth later
<tpw_rules> o
<tpw_rules> ignore that
<tpw_rules> i've coded for the NES
<tpw_rules> it's pretty cool
<Evil0ne> haha
<|Shadow|> jun12th-july9th
<Hyperiant> nice
<Hyperiant> I can't code for crap
<tpw_rules> booo :P
<Hyperiant> All I know is a few basic BASIC commands
<tr0n> havent touched my wii in about that long
<tr0n> :P
<tpw_rules> learn Python
<tpw_rules> http://docs.python.org/tutorial/
<Hyperiant> Python, LISP, lua, and Perl all sound so godly
<Sonic41> I think I've got that bookmarked
*|Shadow| touches tr0n's wii
<tpw_rules> python is godlier
<Sonic41> :P
<tpw_rules> lisp LOOKS godlier
<Hyperiant> lua is most-used in my circles
<tpw_rules> lua's weird imo
<tpw_rules> i only used it to write some script for an emulator
<Hyperiant> Most of my potential work involves coding with the Source engine and some THQ games I still muck around with
<Atmel> me either
<Hyperiant> which only uses lua coding
<Corevette789> How do you set ChanServ to flood protect
<Hyperiant> unless there's a python compiler for the wii I probably won't learn it
<Proto> /cs set flood lines:time I think
<Proto> #channel name in there somewhere
<Aristeo> ummm
<Curly> um
<Curly> it's not
<Curly> that's
<tpw_rules> python isn't compiled
<tpw_rules> ooh cool, source engine
<Hyperiant> what
<tpw_rules> it's interpreted
<Curly> okay
<Hyperiant> well I obviously have no idea what I'm talking about
<Proto> I knew it was wrong >_>
<Hyperiant> I've never compiled code before so pardon my stupidity
<Stitch> Aristeo: Doesn't Insp have +f?
<tpw_rules> i want to get garry's mod except a) it costs money and b) parents won't let me get it
<Aristeo> Yes :3
<Curly> /mode #channel +f <# of line>:<per seconds>
<Hyperiant> Executed code maybe
<Curly> yes it does
<Stitch> Knew it.
<Hyperiant> Gmod is $5 and the best purchase you will ever make
<Curly> so...
<Sonic41> :O Why won't they let you get it?
<Curly> 5 lines per 8 seconds would be like
<Curly> /mode #channel +f 5:8
<tpw_rules> compiled is where the desired code is compiled from a higher language down to the machine language for the target, for example, C
<tpw_rules> i want to get it with tf2 so i have shit to play with
<Stitch> Things to ponder: "When sign makers go on strike is there anything written on their signs?"
*Curly pokes Corevette789
<Proto> haha
<Curly> http://wiki.inspircd.org/1.1/Channel_Modes <-- useful :O
<Hyperiant> ah
<Hyperiant> TF2 modding is done in lua too
<tr0n> what else is new and good
<essex[sX]> hi
<tr0n> app wise
<Hyperiant> Heck you can mod any source game by hacking together some lua code
<Evil0ne> wiimc
<Evil0ne> wii explorer
<Corevette789> Curly Thanks:)
<tr0n> Harley_Davidson_Road_Trip_USA_WII-ZRY
<tr0n> whats wiimc?
<tpw_rules> interpreted is where a separate program, usually written in a compiled language, reads either a) some form of bytecode (example: java) or b) the source directly (example: certain BASIC dialects) and then ran in a VM by the interpreter
<Evil0ne> wii media center
<tr0n> hmm
<tpw_rules> Hyperiant: could you be a nice boy and gift me TF2+garry's mod?
<Evil0ne> play vide ect over network share and locally
<Hyperiant> sure, once I actually have some money
<tr0n> neat
<tpw_rules> if i could get the money to you, i would
<Hyperiant> oh
<Hyperiant> All you need is a paypal account
<Alex313> network share?
<Hyperiant> Or a prepaid card
<tpw_rules> but i think giving money to some random person on the internet would go over about as well as asking for it directly
<Evil0ne> smb
<Evil0ne> for windows networking via ip
<Hyperiant> Just buy a $10 prepaid from Walmart
<tpw_rules> how do i get money into the paypal account?
<tpw_rules> ?
<Hyperiant> need a checking account
<tpw_rules> ohh
<Alex313> i dont understand smb or any of that
<tpw_rules> see, i'm 13, so i probably can't get a paypal account or fill it with money
<Evil0ne> hehe
<Hyperiant> actually
<Evil0ne> then u dont need to mess with it :)
<Hyperiant> wells fargo has teen checking
<Alex313> Yea, that's how I roll. If I don't know about it then I dont take the risk
<Sonic41> Teen checking? Never heard of that
<Hyperiant> I'm using it actually
<essex[sX]> oh man
<essex[sX]> i wonder if i'm the oldest person here
<Hyperiant> They give you a debit/ATM
<tpw_rules> i think i'll badger my parents more and see if i can get it without having to get it as a gift
<tpw_rules> essex[sX]: lol, how old?
<essex[sX]> i'm 26
<Sonic41> 0_0

<tpw_rules> but my parents are assholes about ratings :/
<Sonic41> lol
<Sonic41> My mom and dad don't seem to care
<Hyperiant> It's cool, just get them to buy you a $10 prepaid
<Austin> :O!
<Sonic41> Weird, though
<Austin> i was first!
<|Shadow|> LOL
<Sonic41> tpw, how is it that you're allowed to come to a Wii hacking forum, but not allowed to get certain games? :P
<tpw_rules> and the annoying thing is that they let me play it at friends' houses
<tpw_rules> here?
<tpw_rules> they kinda don't know
<tpw_rules> they only know i'm in one channel on a different network
<|Shadow|> so we find out Alex313 isnt a risk taker
<tpw_rules> never really told them iirc
<Evil0ne> so he isnt
<|Shadow|> sux2bh
<tpw_rules> but they're basically "yeah, yeah that's great now come to dinner"
<tpw_rules> :P
<Evil0ne> yerp
<Sonic41> lol, mine don't even know about my "internet life"
<Sonic41> lol
<Evil0ne> whats the point of liveing if u dont push it a lil
<essex[sX]> LOL FCHAN BLORL
<Sonic41> They only know that I run unsigned code on the Wii, and that if I brick, that's my fault
<tpw_rules> hah
<tpw_rules> my wii is mine
<tpw_rules> nobody else touches it
<essex[sX]> funny
<essex[sX]> your parents know what unsigned code is
<Sonic41> lol, not at all
<tpw_rules> no, they have no idea of the extent of my presence on the internet :P
<Sonic41> :P
<Athenon> tpw_rules: you rang?

<essex[sX]> left the door open when they were porking?
<Hyperiant> same idea
<exo-squad> i said, no, more like 10"
<Hyperiant> hahahaa
<Sonic41> Apparently they somehow stumbled upon a website that lets them watch movies online
<tpw_rules> hahaha
<junh1024-XDCC> drf's a mirco$not fanboi
*junh1024-XDCC hides
<Sonic41> My mom was all "is this legal?"
*Stitch added to Curly's time on idlerpg. :)
<essex[sX]> they googled netflix o_O
<Sonic41> And I'm thinking -_-
<tpw_rules> my family only knows 99% of online things because of me
<Runix> lol
<Sonic41> It was some pirate site, apparently. -_-
<tpw_rules> the really fucking annoying thing is i accidentally introduced them to lolcats
<Athenon> dude i love lolcats! :D
<Curly> D:
<Sonic41> But I don't think they're doing that again.
<tpw_rules> they don't know/don't care about the gigabytes of illegal shows i torrent
<Sonic41> :P
<Curly> not a whole minute! noooooo! D:
<tr0n> ahh
<tr0n> god bless peopleofwalmart
<Stitch> A minute..AND A HALF
<Evil0ne> wally swap?
<essex[sX]> i need to figure something out
<tpw_rules> Athenon: the annoying thing is my siblings bother me to death about funny ones they see and demand that i see them
*Chimera lays down and purrs like a kitty :3
<Sonic41> I swear, they think they need to put filters on me? :P It is I that should be putting the filters on them
<tr0n> nope
<essex[sX]> is anyone familiar with crap or loadstructor?
<tpw_rules> Sonic41: i do that xD
<Athenon> tpw_rules: even though youve already seen them? ;P
<tpw_rules> yup
<Arcanine> 04o-o
<Athenon> yeah
<tpw_rules> and sometimes they're inappropriate, so i'm like "oh, god"
<tr0n> http://media.peopleofwalmart.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/1536Mizz.jpg
<Athenon> people send me xkcd things sometimes....ive seen 95% of the good ones on that site XD
<tr0n> caption
<tr0n> Does anybody have any beanbags? Im really in the mood to play some cornhole.
<Evil0ne> ha ha
<Athenon> inappropriate lolcats...where?!
<Athenon> tpw_rules: youre really 13? O_O
<Sonic41> ewww, inappropriate lolcats
<tpw_rules> a) yes and b) their sibling sites
<tpw_rules> they found those too
<tpw_rules> like failblog
<Sonic41> I hope they didn't find 4chan
<tpw_rules> nope
<tpw_rules> also, what really pisses me off is when i show them something funny then all of a sudden it's the center of attention for the rest of the year and they annoy the hell out of me with it
<tpw_rules> people are over-rated
<Sonic41> lol
<Curly> OMG EVIL!
<Sonic41> From time to time, my parents will show me something that I already know how to do
<Sonic41> -_-
<tpw_rules> hahaha
<Sonic41> Believe it or not, my mom used to be the technically savvy one
<Stitch> That's what you get for challenging me. :)
<tpw_rules> my dad did too
<essex[sX]> i really don't believe it
<tpw_rules> then he started getting lazy and just bothered me when he had trouble
<Sonic41> :P
<Sonic41> Yeah, I pretty much handle anything that goes wrong -- tech-wise, anyway
<Curly> I was just minding my own business and I /tripped/ into you D:
<Hyperiant> My dad's the tech-savvy guy
*Curly runs away in tears
<Hyperiant> Inspired me to become one
<Hyperiant> Now everyone comes to me for tech support when they cba to bother him
*Proto slaps Stitch
<Proto> don't make curleh cry D:
<Sonic41> :P
*Arcanine thinks kitties are too lazy :P
<Hyperiant> I've blown up a good many PCs in my dad
<Hyperiant> day
<Sonic41> One of my mom's friends wanted me to set up her router
<Sonic41> It wasn't hard... all she had to do was follow the instructions
<essex[sX]> you can't let anyone know you know about technology
<essex[sX]> NEVER
<Sonic41> But she didn't know what the modem was...
<Hyperiant> hehe
<Sonic41> -_-
<essex[sX]> normies thing technology is ARCANE BLACK MAGIC
<essex[sX]> if you let them know you can do it
<essex[sX]> they'll never stop bugging you
<Hyperiant> If anyone asks you what a CD is
<Hyperiant> Say "is that what they use to diagnose you for brain tumors"
<essex[sX]> "hey... essex... how do i GOOOGOL something?"
<tpw_rules> xkcd agrees :P
<Sonic41> lol
<tpw_rules> the problem is people tend to piss me off
<Sonic41> What? With simple stuff?
<tpw_rules> no no no, in general
<tpw_rules> i'm NOT a people person
<Sonic41> :P
<Sonic41> You like to sit and code, huh? :3
<tpw_rules> yup
<tpw_rules> computers don't say no :D
<Hyperiant> I'm a people person
<Hyperiant> When "people" means "people who know what they're doing in vB"
<essex[sX]> peer is a jerk
<tpw_rules> lol
<tpw_rules> essex[sX]: he didn't do anything here
<tpw_rules> i think you closed your client by mistake
<tpw_rules> i just got a standard quit
<exo-squad> http://www.peopleofwalmart.com/?p=14930 hot
<Sonic41> Yeah, I'm actually a people person
<Sonic41> But when I try to bring my knowledge into a conversation, they're all... "lolwut"
<tpw_rules> i hate crowds
<essex[sX]> whats the shortcut to connect to a server?
<Sonic41> And it's saddening, because noone else shares the knowledge that I do
<tpw_rules> i hate people who are stupid (pretty much everybody in my mind)
<tpw_rules> essex[sX]: /server <server>
<tpw_rules> Sonic41: another reason IRC is teh winz
<Stitch> ..
<Sonic41> :D
*Stitch emocorners.
<essex[sX]> sweet, thanks
<Sonic41> :P I guess that's why I've stuck with the Wii scene for awhile
<Sonic41> *for so long
<tpw_rules> lol
<tpw_rules> i also have aspergers, defined by wikipedia as "Asperger syndrome or Asperger's syndrome is an autism spectrum disorder that is characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests."
<tpw_rules> so when it's hard to communicate with people, they just annoy you :P
<essex[sX]> do you OFFICIALLY have aspergers?
<essex[sX]> or are you self diagnosed?
<Hyperiant> probably selfdiagnosed
<Hyperiant> or parentally diagnosed
<tpw_rules> a psyciatrist said so, so i would say so
<Hyperiant> I was professionally diagnosed with aspergers but apparently I've "grown out of it"
<Sonic41_> I thought I heard my mom
<Sonic41_> D:
<Athenon> i think i have a touch of aspergers
<Hyperiant> I like to think I was just a little jerk when I was little
<tpw_rules> so you kicked out your power cable?
<Sonic41_> No, I closed my laptop
<essex[sX]> i think if you really have aspergers you just dont understand sarcasm
<tpw_rules> i'm kinda bad at that
<Sonic41_> I think I should change the setting so that it doens't sleep
<tr0n> Table dances are $20, lap dances are $30, and a backbreaker off the top rope is gonna run you $50.
<tr0n> http://media.peopleofwalmart.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/1441.jpg
<Sonic41_> *doesn't
<Sonic41_> And I'm bad at detecting textual sarcasm
<essex[sX]> the only guy i ever know with aspergers could NOT get sarcasm
<Curly> I had a channel named the #emocorner once >.>
<tpw_rules> i use sarcasm a lot in everyday life
<essex[sX]> other than that a lot of people who are self diagnosed aspergers are just assholes or are not good socially
<tpw_rules> my parents get annoyed though cause i use it to insult people
<Hyperiant> I never use sarcasm
<Hyperiant> Evetr
<Aristeo> :o
<Hyperiant> ever
<Proto> lol
<essex[sX]> like me
<Aristeo> noooooooooooooo
<Aristeo> Curly:
<essex[sX]> i don't have aspergers
<Hyperiant> I'm the most non-sarcastic person in the world
<essex[sX]> i'm just an asshole
<Aristeo> We has a better tutorial!
<Athenon> well asperger's is kinda defined as not good socially xP
<tpw_rules> Hyperiant: lol
<Curly> O:
<Sonic41_> lol
<tpw_rules> essex[sX]: well, my psyciatrist said that i had aspergers
<Aristeo> http://www.epic-chat.net/wiki/Channel_modes
<Curly> now I feel so guilty ^^;

<essex[sX]> did you call him a dick?
<essex[sX]> what a dick thing to say to someone
<tpw_rules> no :P
<essex[sX]> ;oP
<Aristeo> xD
<Curly> o:
<Curly> it's in alphabetic order!
<Curly> that makes more senses
*Aristeo nods
<Sonic41> We should have a rave
<Sonic41> :P
<tpw_rules> lol
<Sonic41> Yeah, #wiidevot has died
<Sonic41> #wiihelp == #wiidevot
<Curly> HA!
<Aristeo> :o
<hunterm> at least i was banned from there, now i do not have to witness the dying process
<essex[sX]> why'd you get banned?
<Curly> I cut off 4 minutes :3
<Aristeo> :D
<hunterm> "<trap15> !kban hunterm annoyance
<hunterm> * iGoogle sets ban on *!*hunterm@*.res.rr.com

<Curly> are you trying to make fun of me or something? D:

<Sonic41> *lolwut*
<hunterm> essex[sX]: yeah, i do, but i don't think it be allowed :(
<hunterm> D:
<Sonic41> I can't wait until I go to college to learn what you guys know
<Sonic41> Or rather, fully understand it all
<hunterm> Sonic41: i am 12. :|
<tr0n> bwahahaha
<Sonic41> Which is saddening to me
<tr0n> http://media.peopleofwalmart.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/1374.jpg

<Proto> do I really?
<hunterm> LOLO

<hunterm> te-he
<Proto> oh
<Stitch> Or Stitch will destroy you.
<essex[sX]> it was an awesome amount of ram
<Athenon> 4mb? i remember the old 512kb ram dos days
<Proto> I choose destruction
<hunterm> *lolwut*
<Hyperiant> my uncle donald used to work on 4k machines
<Athenon> 8mb extended ram OMG OMG OMG
<Hyperiant> 4k
<essex[sX]> lol
<Hyperiant> 2 was system
<Hyperiant> 2 was program
<Hyperiant> I mean
<Hyperiant> One was used for storage
<Hyperiant> One was used for basically RAM
<hunterm> nowadays, 4mb would not load a linux terminal
<essex[sX]> i have 4gb on my laptop
<tpw_rules> yes it would
<hunterm> yo sonic41, your connection is sux0rs
<Hyperiant> 4MB will load a really scaled down linux terminal if you work hard and cross your fingers
<Sonic41> Weird, I just got d/c'd for no apparent reason
<tpw_rules> my ds has 4MB
<megazig> lol, IOS61 is here

<GeneraLee> so i think i have to replace the dvd
<|Shadow|> its a hardware thign tht cant be changed
<|Shadow|> only thign to do is replace the dvdrom drive
<|Shadow|> but why?
<DannyZee> there are replacement-boards on ebay
<|Shadow|> just get a usb hdd
<DannyZee> for the dvd
<|Shadow|> and run all your wii games off it
<GeneraLee> You guys know a place selling dvds...?
<|lucid|> swap out the board for a board with all three chips
<|Shadow|> fuck replacing
<DannyZee> I swapped the board on mine
<DannyZee> from an old bricked wii
<DannyZee> :D
<GeneraLee> yes, but for GC games, until they release the GC Loader, the only way is through dvd-rs...
<|Shadow|> GeneraLee aka DannyZee
<DannyZee> no problem at all... just some soldering required. piece of cake :D
<GeneraLee> thats why i wanted to replace the dvd

<|Yummy|> Yeah, I have all my games on a USB drive that's not FAT32... so I will have to pull them to another drive, format the USB and then convert...
<|Yummy|> going to be a process

<drf|work> Dell Wireless 1501 802.11b/g/n Half Mini Card [Included in Price]
<drf|work> 	 Dell Wireless 1520 802.11a/g/n Draft Mini Card [add $15.00]
<drf|work> um, wrong window
<Altair> lol
<drf|work> so far this Dell looks like a bad deal
<drf|work> to get even *close* to my MSI it's almost at $2000
<drf|work> compared to the $1400 or so mine cost
<drf|work> I'm just bored LOL
<drf|work> and my boss handed me a brand new Dell Latitude and asked me to install software
<drf|work> has an i7 and 4GB RAM, so I thought "This is pretty decent" - that was, until I saw how much these suckers cost
<drf|work> http://img706.imageshack.us/img706/8964/36673330.png <-- Fail
<zu-zuXtimeshift> so failed
<Altair> lmao
<drf|work> Starting Price - $2,369.00; Instant Savings - $354.00; Subtotal - $2,015.00 <-- fail
<drf|work> my MSI was $1700
<drf|work> just, mine has a Core 2 Quad and not an i7 :/
<zu-zuXtimeshift> jesus
<drf|work> whatever, same diff I suppose
<Airwolve> actually there is a significant performance increase from C2Q to Ci7
<drf|work> hm
<drf|work> not really worth $300 though
<drf|work> plus my C2Q is 2.24GHz, that's I believe 2.37
<drf|work> the i7
<drf|work> no, 2.67
<drf|work> which is nice
<Sneas> 03o.o
<Airwolve> mine was only 30-40 above the C2Q I was considering
<Airwolve> and it oc'd nicely to 4GHz with a watercooler
<Altair> :o
*Airwolve cough
<drf|work> is it a laptop though?
<Neko> o.o
<Airwolve> need to look better for an offer with an i7 if you're being charged $300 more for it
<drf|work> I know
<drf|work> I was just seeing how much Dell charged
<drf|work> as the Latitude seems like a better laptop than some of their cheapie ones
<drf|work> but it costs a ton as well as I showed
<drf|work> (customized, that is)
<zu-zuXtimeshift> well ill see yous later
<drf|work> now $400 of that was a Blu-Ray drive
<drf|work> which my laptop has
<drf|work> so yeah
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14o.o#
<Airwolve> take the Blu-ray drive out and get one yourself for like 70, maybe less now
<drf|work> for a laptop?
<drf|work> I've seen desktop BDs, not laptop sold separately
<Sneas> 03iyfud
<Airwolve> http://www.callaccessories.com/product_info.php?language=en&currency=GBP&products_id=5504 found that on the first page of google shopping results for laptop blu-ray drive
*cupid hi
<drf|work> interesting
<Airwolve> most for laptop were 140-170, but that's still cheaper than what you were being offered

<GunInHand> so what do you guys do here?
<Alex313> Help people with modded wii's
<GunInHand> sweet
<GunInHand> here anything about a 4.3 fix yet?
<GunInHand> i've hacked two wii's so far
<GunInHand> the tutorials are getting much better
<GunInHand> finally figured out that my hard drive going to sleep was crashing my wii
<GunInHand> luckily i had a maxtor
<GunInHand> so I was able to use the seagate tools
<GunInHand> to make it so it doesn;t sleep anymore
<GunInHand> however I am kind of worried about how that will affect the life of the drive

<GunInHand> anybody else have a situation like that and not have anu issues with the drive later on?
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14LOL
<DeathLok> GunInHand I have to constantly unplug my drives to reset them for my 360
<GunInHand> @DeathLok you can hook up USB drives to your 360?
<DeathLok> yeah
<GunInHand> holy cow
<GunInHand> you got to mod the 360 for that too?
<DeathLok> for playing extracted games yes, for using a usb drive as storage for your saves and such, no
<GunInHand> i imagine xbox live would be banning boxes like crazy
<GunInHand> i have a hacked regular xbox
<GunInHand> i dont take that online at all
<DeathLok> yeah thats why I gave up live
<GunInHand> wow
<DeathLok> the regular xbox was awesome for that
<GunInHand> not sure I could do that
<GunInHand> i am still using it every night
<GunInHand> i run xbox media center
<GunInHand> its an awesome media server
<DeathLok> well you could still run xbmc
<DeathLok> just block live access
<GunInHand> how do you block?

<Roleplay4life> 5D: Pro Basketball. So commercialized. Makes me saaaaad.
*Katie 6decides against it
<Roleplay4life> 5But he's a heck of a player.
<Katie> 6I prefer myspace and facebook
<Roleplay4life> 5I would get a Twitter to follow Leonard Nimoy,
<Katie> 6I hate basketball
<Roleplay4life> 5but that would be kind of stalker-ish,
<Roleplay4life> 5considering he's like almost 80 and I've read his autobiography like six times.
<drf|work> LOL
<Katie> 6O.o
<drf|work> I swear I keep reading that Nimroy
<Roleplay4life> 5I think basketball is okay.

<Katie|failure> 6Volt*
<Roleplay4life> 5Got this art project thingymabobber to work on. ^^
<EFAILGUY> huh, do i need anything other than IOS249 to run backups? it still errors on load "An error has occurred. press eject button"
<GunInHand> you have to have the right dvd drive to run backups
<GunInHand> new drives wont do it
<EFAILGUY> i was doing it yesterday so it shoudl be ok.
<Alex313> I think something is wrong with my hdd.
<GunInHand> so it was working then it quit?
<EFAILGUY> uhh
<Alex313> It's transfer rate is getting less than 1mbps
<LiThIuMx> lol
<EFAILGUY> welli was trying to update my softmod[?] stuff to run mario galaxy 2
<GunInHand> ah
<EFAILGUY> so im thinking what has to be installed to run backups?
<RP4L|Art> 5:D I just realized I'm only a little over 500 pageviews away from my 20K Kiriban on DeviantART. HURRAH~
<EFAILGUY> i installed IOS249 just now.
<EFAILGUY> that didnt help
<viince> update ios249 to rev19 ?
<Katie|failure> 6'
<Katie|failure> 6everybody poofed away D:
<Katie|failure> 6-clap-
<EFAILGUY> yep
<EFAILGUY> thats what i *just* did
<RP4L|Art> 5Yeah I noticed that. ><
<viince> what happens when you try to load smg2 ?
<GunInHand> i got mario 2 to run but it was a retail copy
<EFAILGUY> uhh
<EFAILGUY> well now it wont run anything
<viince> what loader ?
<Alex313> .28 mbs wtf is happenin?
<EFAILGUY> no loader.
<EFAILGUY> the disc channel
<Katie|failure> 6anyone ever hear of Perfect World International?
<GunInHand> i couldnt get event he retail copy to work with the dsic channel
<EFAILGUY> do i need a loader now?
<viince> I can't run backups, usb hdd only...
<Alex313> You need a loader retard
<EFAILGUY> thanks :)
<GunInHand> loader
<RP4L|Art> 5Not me. o-o
<EFAILGUY> thats what i was looking for
<RP4L|Art> 5What is it?
<GunInHand> that si what you need
<EFAILGUY> whats a good loader?
<viince> go with cfg
<Katie|failure> 6Online game
<Alex313> cfg
<[NiNjA]UK> www.cfgloader.com
<[NiNjA]UK> great loader
<Katie|failure> 6It's pretty fun, takes LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG time to download though
<viince> http://gwht.wikidot.com/usb-loader
<[NiNjA]UK> infact you'd be plain silly to go with anything else!
<EFAILGUY> usb loader?
<Alex313> cfg is the best out there no matter what
<EFAILGUY> i couldnt find a channel version of that
<RP4L|Art> 5Geez.
<viince> get a usb hdd
<RP4L|Art> 5And OMG
<EFAILGUY> i dont have a usb hdd that will work.
<viince> there's forwarder channels
<RP4L|Art> 5MY TABLET IS WORKING WITH SAI. :DD
<viince> get one
<RP4L|Art> 5Finally!!!
<Katie|failure> 6YAY
<GunInHand> i got mg2 to work with neogamma
<EFAILGUY> surely there must be a loader that will work in a normal channel and work with backups?
<|lucid|> http://gbatemp.net/index.php?showtopic=147638
<RP4L|Art> 5I hate trying to do linearts on Photoshop; they look so much nicer on SAI. But I do all my coloring and effects in PS. ^___^
<|lucid|> use a forwarder
<Katie|failure> 6I dun have PS
<Airwolve> every art tool is optimised towards something
<Katie|failure> 6:(
<EFAILGUY> how do you get it to run off the onboard flash?
<Airwolve> even GIMP has its strong points
<Katie|failure> 6I have MS paint and GIMP lol
<|lucid|> get neogamma for that
<Airwolve> I couldn't tell you what they are, but it has them.
*Airwolve cough
<viince> you can use usb flash drives...they are slow and limited in space
<EFAILGUY> yeah cuz i dont have an sdcard i can dedicate to that.
<viince> and expensive per gb
<EFAILGUY> im not worried about that since i use dvd-r
<|lucid|> get an SD card anyway, they are like $10
<EFAILGUY> ok
<viince> a good sd card is important if you want to use much homebrew
<EFAILGUY> so youre saying there are nolonger any normal loaders?
<|lucid|> 2GB regular SD card
<|lucid|> what the heck is a normal loader
<EFAILGUY> anything that can install as a channel, and load dvd-r
<viince> the channels are not the loader
<|lucid|> Neogamma, but use a forwarder channel
<GunInHand> anybody know how to rip wii games using the black wii?
<EFAILGUY> forwarder?
<|lucid|> that way when the program updates you dont have to update the channel
<EFAILGUY> doesnt that require it to run from an sdcard tho?
<viince> the loader is homebrew, the wad installs the forwarder that runs the homebrew (loader)
<|lucid|> yes
<EFAILGUY> ok im trying to find a solution that doesnt require an sdcard
<|lucid|> good luck
<GunInHand> pretty much
<EFAILGUY> gee thanks.
<GunInHand> they are dirt cheap and you can buy them anywhere
<GunInHand> tehy are right next to the pack of gum
<viince> can't priiloader be set to run an installed boot.dol ?
<RP4L|Art> 5I've never used GIMP. ^^;
<viince> or that might be off sd still
<Alex313> Is there a way for me to run a diognostic check on my hdd? I'm only getting 1mbps so im worried.
<RP4L|Art> 5I've been using Photoshop since I started doing digital art (it's my mom's LOL. she's a photographer).
<viince> usb hdd ?
<Airwolve> *photoshopper
<Airwolve> ?
*Airwolve hides
<GunInHand> depends on what files you are transfering
<Alex313> yea
<RP4L|Art> 5That too.
<viince> usb 1.1 cable ?
<Alex313> Nope 2.0
<RP4L|Art> 5Sometimes she uses PS, sometimes she doesn't.
<viince> also can depend on the sector size
<viince> or, chunk...what you pick when you format
<Alex313> Its fat32
<GunInHand> i know I had an issue with a drive where the driver got screwed up and it slowed down to less than a 1MB
<viince> ok..you can set up to 32kb...
<viince> 16k chunk gives good performance
<viince> what drive do you havge ?
<viince> have ... ?
<Alex313> Seagate GO 320gb
<RP4L|Art> 5By the way, Arceus is too freaking detailed. Dx This lineart is going to take forever.
<EFAILGUY> ok neogamma works fine
<Katie|PWI> 6You're making an Arceus? Cool
<EFAILGUY> is there a .wad version of neogamma u can run as a channel without an sdcard?
<Alex313> There ya go
<Alex313> Doubt it
<RP4L|Art> 5It's part of a project I'm doing. D
<RP4L|Art> 5**:D
<viince> Alex, once you can clear the drive off, format it with a larger block size
<drf|work> EW ADOBE
<Alex313> k
<drf|work> GIMP is where it's at XD
<viince> 4 k is standard
<RP4L|Art> 5Six Pokmon, three humans, one insane thing.
<Katie|PWI> 6OMGYUS DRF
<RP4L|Art> 5@DRF. D:
<RP4L|Art> 5Why do you hate adobeeee?
<RP4L|Art> 5Fancypants filters FTW. o3o
<drf|work> because their programs are bloated as frick
<viince> are you moving off a million tiny files ?
<drf|work> like, they eat your computer's memory alive
<RP4L|Art> 5 /Bloated/?
<Alex313> No
<drf|work> yep
<Airwolve> yes
<Airwolve> like the fish
*Airwolve ahem
<Katie|PWI> 6RP4L, you got a dA?
<drf|work> LOL
<RP4L|Art> 5That's why you get a computer with lots of memory.
<RP4L|Art> 5Yup, I have a dA!
<RP4L|Art> 5Roleplay4life.deviantart.com
<drf|work> that's not the point
<drf|work> I'm not gonna use all the memory on one program >_>
<Katie|PWI> 6ok^^ I'm C-Town-Wolf
<RP4L|Art> 5But I have no other programs that I need. xD
<RP4L|Art> 5I mean, I got a couple
*Katie|PWI 6goes to add RP4L to her deviantwatch
<viince> is the 2.0 cable connected to a 2.0 port ?
<RP4L|Art> 5but most of my computer time is spent on PS, Microsoft Word, and the internet.
<Alex313> I believe every port on here is 2.0
<viince> is there any other usb ports being used ?
<RP4L|Art> 5**And Windows Media Player.
<RP4L|Art> 5For my 'tunes~
<Katie|PWI> 6OH SNAP, I HEARD THUNDAH
<Alex313> One has my bluetooth adapter
<Trace> :o
<viince> is that normal ?
*Katie|PWI 6cowers in fear
<Alex313> I guess
<viince> any other devices can slow down the transfer
<RP4L|Art> 5Is it storming where you're at?
<Katie|PWI> 6Just started
<viince> I expect ~15MB/s or better from internal hdd to usb hdd...but between 2 usb hdd's, that drops to half
<RP4L|Art> 5It's like.. sunny here.
<Katie|PWI> 6it's raining really hard
<Katie|PWI> 6we just got through that nasty heast wave where I live
<TimeShift> wished it was raining here, though
<Katie|PWI> 6heat*
<TimeShift> been so damn hot all day
<RP4L|Art> 5I was in North Dakota during NE's hot spell. xD Lucky me~
<Katie|PWI> 6I was in PA during the NE's heat spell.... lucky me -_-
<RP4L|Art> 5It was beautiful there. 80-90 degrees Farenheit and windy almost every day. I got lots of bug bites and some sunburn, but nothing terrible.
<viince> you might look into updating your drivers for it...reinstall
<RP4L|Art> 5But I bet the week of Band Camp it'll be 100 degrees every day. --;
<RP4L|Art> 5ALWAYS HAPPENS.
<Katie|PWI> 6Lol 4 straight days of 90+ degree weather, humidity 4000%, no wind, UGH
<RP4L|Art> 5At least it's my last band camp everrr~ 8DDD
<Katie|PWI> 6ok back to PWI
<viince> see if you can install a game on the wii...if it is slow also
<RP4L|Art> 5LOOOOL, humidity 4000% would be like a major downpour. xD
<Prince-dari> Lol, what's band camp?
<RP4L|Art> 5Band Camp is.. the week of hell for marching band students.
<viince> you haven't gone and updated firmware have you ?
<EFAILGUY> http://gbatemp.net/index.php?showtopic=159099 that works fine and is in a channel yay
<Prince-dari> Ahh, that kind of band.
<RP4L|Art> 5Five days of intense marching practice, lots of drilling, and basically learning half the show in a week.
<EFAILGUY> <3 gbatemp
<drf|work> it's also a place where girls can have inapropriate fun with flutes
<drf|work> I mean
<drf|work> that.
<RP4L|Art> 5All on a blisteringly hot football field.
<viince> runs from usb:\\ ?
<drf|work> you guys use a real football field?
<TimeShift> how can humidity exceed 100%?
<EFAILGUY> no
<RP4L|Art> 5You even get astroturf tire pieces in your shoes. YAY.
<EFAILGUY> runs from a channel.
<drf|work> we always just used grass LOLL
<drf|work> -L
<RP4L|Art> 5Yup, we practice on the school's field.
<drf|work> oh that sucks
<Prince-dari> TimeShift: Humidity in comparison to the humidity of another day?
<drf|work> band camp at school? Boo
<Katie|PWI> 6It can, according to Katt Williams, Timeshift
<RP4L|Art> 5It's not actually a camp; we go home every night.

<drf|work> as a freshman
<drf|work> LOL

<Runix> They have done quite a few major sites already
<Chimera> hi
<drf|work> Apple can't standardize anything besides how to steal your money.
<viince> It looks like R8 is latest
<Runix> They never stole mine, they tried to give me the best deal possible
<drf|work> That's because you worked for them >_>
<Sneas> 03ih :3
<Runix> At least when I go to their store people are always smiling, awaiting hand a foot live servants
<Runix> Like
<CobraX83> if my ext hd that holds only my wii backups is showing up as raw is there anyway to partition it with a fat32 drive as well without losing the games?
<drf|work> yeah, they smile, but they're idiots
<drf|work> like
<drf|work> I went there one time
<drf|work> tried to buy something in iTunes on an ipad
<drf|work> asked them how to cancel it
<drf|work> they were like "Um, can you?"
<Runix> Here in Canada it is different
<drf|work> I was like "Can you?"
<drf|work> they were like "I don't think so"
<drf|work> I was like "... you really can't cancel a download?"
<Runix> You can't
<drf|work> "Nope."
<Runix> It's standard and law
<drf|work> So i was like
<CobraX83> im trying to make a partition dont know what the best way would be any help would be appreciated
<drf|work> now I have to wait 48 hours
<drf|work> for their lame excuse for Wi-Fi
<drf|work> to download this 3GB file
<drf|work> and I was like, can you fix this pleaseS?
<drf|work> they were like um, I don't know how
<Runix> Hahaha
<drf|work> I was like, real genius tehre
<drf|work> I tried renting a movie on iPad
<drf|work> to see what the quality looked like
<Runix> I did and it was awesome
<drf|work> it told me 48 hours left
<drf|work> and Iw as like f this
<drf|work> but I couldn't cancel it
<drf|work> nor get my money back
<Runix> Yea a 48 hour limit
<drf|work> so yeah, the people at the Apple store grin away but can't actually help you
<drf|work> ........
<Runix> Like renting a movie in store
<drf|work> I MEAN THE TIME IT TAKES TO DOWNLOAD
<drf|work> THAT'S HOW SLOW THE INTERNET WAS
<Runix> Don't need to yell
<Runix> Lol
<drf|work> still
<drf|work> every time I've gone in there the people who work there can't help
<Runix> Still, you don't understand the company like I do
<drf|work> like sometimes I'll just go to check my email and/or troll their computers
<drf|work> and I can't even get 5 minutes of peace without them going "You sure you don't want to buy anything?"
<FuZZBaLL> is it broken?
<drf|work> and I'm like "NO I DON'T THANK YOU"
<Runix> In this case you really don't know why you go through what you do
<EFAILGUY> viince: if you think thats cool , there used to be a program dealy to make the disc channel play backups too.
<Runix> You need to know the terms
<drf|work> ...
<drf|work> what?
<drf|work> I just buy parts and whatnot
<drf|work> I built my own computer
<drf|work> you can't build a Mac
<CobraX83> no im just following a guide on how to add rb and the dlc i have to the hdd instead of the sd card since it doesnt hold many
<Runix> As did I
<Runix> Then it was stolen
<drf|work> and whose fault is that
<drf|work> keep your house locked
<Runix> This is e most portable piece of technology for what I do
<CobraX83> and it requires i have a fat32 section on my hd
<Runix> I'm a pokemon USA representative
<FuZZBaLL> proly have to copy them somewhere
<Runix> I mostly email and browse their site
<drf|work> orly?
<Runix> And order
<FuZZBaLL> a format is usually destructive
<drf|work> I thought you worked for a website comapny
<drf|work> *company
<Runix> Yes
<Runix> I can create events
<CobraX83> so i need to backup my games or just put them back on from my actual copies?
<FuZZBaLL> mebbie partition magic can help
<Runix> I have a league and tournaments hosted, and I deliver supplies to stores
<drf|work> but you don't actually work for Pokmon USA, do you?
<Runix> I do
<Runix> Under organized play
<drf|work> what
<Runix> For the Vancouver region
<drf|work> oh
<drf|work> so you can't get like, exclusive stuff?
<drf|work> like movies and whatnot?
<FuZZBaLL> I use a WODE so it's NTFS all the way...
<Runix> I can
<drf|work> can you get Pokmon movies in HD?
<Runix> To show it off, not to sell before the time
<FuZZBaLL> but if you have the games them it might be easier to put them back on after the format
<drf|work> I got 2 and 3 from Apple TV, which cost me a fricking fortune
<drf|work> and it didn't even work right
<CobraX83> well i have a ext 500 gig passport i believe it is
<drf|work> which is again Apple's fault
<Runix> I said organized play only
<drf|work> oh
<FuZZBaLL> rather than mess about
<drf|work> that doesn't help then
<drf|work> I'm an encoder
<CobraX83> no free agent go
<drf|work> I need audio/video material :P
<FuZZBaLL> depends how much you value your time
<CobraX83> i know
<Runix> And I just need a proper system that is lit weight and portable
<Runix> Lint
<FuZZBaLL> and how many gamea are on it
<CobraX83> well if i format the drive i can choosehow much lets say for fat32 and it will leave the rest in wbfs format?
<Skylands> 10Hey Chumera
<Runix> Light*
<drf|work> LOL fail
<drf|work> have you seen the Lenovo U1 Hybrid?
<Katie|PWI> 6lol
<FuZZBaLL> proly not
<drf|work> That thing's like 50x better than the iPad
<Runix> fricken autocorrect, I will turn it off
<Runix> I don't want lento
<CobraX83> does wiiflow still work with fat32?
<Runix> Lenovo
<CobraX83> should right
<FuZZBaLL> ni
<Runix> Skldjfghsfdjkhsfdnj
<drf|work> how come?
<CobraX83> is that a no
<FuZZBaLL> its a no idea
<CobraX83> ahh sorry
<Runix> Because I don't want any system like that
<FuZZBaLL> [ 20:05.09 ] -( FuZZBaLL ): I use a WODE
<Runix> It's plastic
<FuZZBaLL> :D
<FuZZBaLL> as total no brainer....
<Runix> I hate computers using plastic as a shell
<FuZZBaLL> WODE just works
<Runix> Annoying because it will be replaced sooner
<CobraX83> i dont know what tthat is
<drf|work> ...what?
<FuZZBaLL> google it....
<FuZZBaLL> its genius
<CobraX83> i will ( :
<drf|work> the U1 Hybrid is a tablet, like the iPad, but it has a base that you can snap it into with a real processor that turns it into a netbook
<FuZZBaLL> I idle to watch the clever people sort out peoples home brew/haxx0r skillz
<Runix> The lenovo doesn't have 3G built in for roaming and emailing
<FuZZBaLL> :P
<Sneas> 03o.o
<Runix> I don't need any of that though
<Runix> I just want this for my work
<Runix> I don't wanna beat around what I need to do
<Airwolve> and what do you think plastic would be replaced with, then?
<FuZZBaLL> WODE takes 10 minutes to fit... you them plug in an NTFS HDD ( mines a ITG Hitachi) and it rips the original games straight to it
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14>> 4WinAmp 14<> 12Pokmon 14<> 3Pokmon Heroes Soundtrack - no year 14<> 7no title 14<<
<Runix> This I can just click, slide and it's ready 24 hours a day
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14lol
<FuZZBaLL> or you can use 'baxkups' you find on the Interweb
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Incomplete downloads fail XD
<FuZZBaLL> assuming you have an Internet connection of course
<FuZZBaLL> ;D
<Runix> I don't want the hassle of restarting a product , that way it's useless
<DasTier> CobraX83: dvdrom emulator directly plugged into wii motherboard, it's basically a small embedded system running linux which gives the wii motherboard the data it would expect coming from the drive, but has lots of features
<Airwolve> the main waste of plastics is in packaging, then lego. Plastic casings are going to carry on a long way yet
<FuZZBaLL> invisible to the firmware too
<Runix> Apple uses small packaging
<Runix> Works for me
<RP4L|Art> 5 /sooooooooooo lost
<Runix> Less waste and it's recycled material
<FuZZBaLL> so no 'an update bricked my jacked Wii help!'
<DasTier> currently at least
<drf|work> Runix	The lenovo doesn't have 3G built in for roaming and emailing <-- I think it does
<drf|work> it's not actually out yet
<drf|work> but I believe it will come with 3G
<Runix> Exactly
<Runix> It's not out yet
<Runix> My point stands clear
<FuZZBaLL> with my luck I'll find a Wii game worth playing just as Nintendo block it
<drf|work> well I know HP has tablet computers
<drf|work> that ARE out
<drf|work> that have keyboards and everything
<drf|work> and you can fold the screen down and use it as only touchscreen
<Runix> This was available earlier
<Runix> Screw hp
<drf|work> um, no?
<drf|work> see
<Runix> Bad bad company
<Airwolve> the tablet computer has been out for ages
<drf|work> you're every bit as brandname biased as I am
<drf|work> I just don't like Apple
<drf|work> you don't like HP, whatever
<drf|work> I don't particularly love HP either but they're a lot better than Apple.
<Quliava> hey uh
<Airwolve> is there anyone worse than apple?
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Heya Quil
<Quliava> I'm not gonna be on anywhere else for a little, I need to set up my new computer
<Runix> HP has nothing but problems lately, overheating being a major, exploding batteries and catching fire
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14k
<drf|work> Satan maybe?
<Airwolve> I'm not sure...
<drf|work> and you didn't hear about the guy's iPhone that had its battery explode?
<Runix> Only because he messed with it
<Airwolve> Apple have had problems with exploding batteries for years
<drf|work> I really don't like big brands at all, whether HP, Dell, Sony, etc
<drf|work> hence why I built my own
<drf|work> but if I had to choose between something like Dell or HP and Apple, I'd go with Dell or HP any day
<Runix> Hence why this conversation is over
<Runix> Dell is worse uhg
<drf|work> money-wise, sure
<drf|work> but they have decent stuff if you don't mind paying too much
<drf|work> (again, same with Apple)
<Airwolve> thousands of iPods have exploded over the years, Apple just gives the victims a free replacement and some monies and the press doesn't hear
<Runix> Iv had nothing but parts dieting and replacements, then customer service to even replace anything
<Runix> Dieing
<Runix> I don't like major hassle companies
<drf|work> I don't like major companies, period
<drf|work> Apple included
<Runix> Face it, the iPad was just there when I needed it for work, the others weren't
<drf|work> what?
<drf|work> tablet PCs have been around forever
<drf|work> like at least 2 years
<Airwolve> the iPad is -late- to the scene
<Airwolve> longer than that
<Runix> I hate tablet pcs
<Runix> I don't need anything overpowered
<Airwolve> Vista launched with support for them and there was extensions for XP before that
<Runix> I just browse pokemon.com, email, and order
<drf|work> LOL overpowered
<drf|work> that's what users like me would call *powerful*
<Airwolve> though 7 is the only one to do it well
<Runix> Anyways discussion is over
<Runix> I don't need a tablet for the work I di
<Runix> Do
<Runix> I need somthing light and portable and doesn't overheat ever
<drf|work> an Android phone?
*drf|work hides
<Runix> This always stays cold
<Runix> I don't need a phone either
<Runix> I like android, but on the current models it's on, there is no chance of me getting one yet
<drf|work> I have the Motorola Droid
<Runix> I wait
<drf|work> and since I have Verizon that worked out fine
*Sneas randomly hugs Sky :3
<Chimera> SKYLANDS :3
<Airwolve> <Runix> I need somthing light and portable and doesn't overheat ever <-- Lol, and the iPad doesn't have overheating problems?
<drf|work> I've never used one for more than 2 minujtes
<drf|work> -j
<Airwolve> it overheats quite easily from stories
<Airwolve> such as one guy who used it to conduct a wedding, and it overheated in the middle of the ceremony
<drf|work> wouldn't surprise me
<drf|work> ...
<drf|work> people conducting weddings with iPads, LAME
<Airwolve> like "PLEASE COOL ME DOWN ELSE I WON'T LET YOU DO ANYTHING" "I can frigging HOLD you just fine so I don't see how you can think it's too hot >:|"
<drf|work> XD
<drf|work> yeah, Apple has been behind the times since like the 80s
<drf|work> they were good back in the days of the //e and whatnot
<drf|work> but ever sicne I've been alive Windows has had the upper hand
<Skylands> 10:O
*Skylands hugs Sneas and Chimera
<Espeon> 6meow
<Espeon> 6meow
<RP4L|Art> 5But everyone these days seems to think Macintosh is the best. All the kids at my school, anyways.
<RP4L|Art> 5They're addicted to their iPod Touches and Apps and stuff.
<drf|work> yeah
<Airwolve> I did have an article that pretty much dated the emergence of the tablet, and guess what? it came out of MS.
<drf|work> iPods are just stupid
<drf|work> LOL
<drf|work> well the other thing I like about Microsoft
<Corevette789> Aristeo, what's up with the +l tags
<drf|work> they don't try to make their own hardware
<Skylands> 10!espeon !sneas !arcanine\
*Sneas now belongs to Skylands for 1 minute
<Corevette789> I cant set a limit
*Arcanine now belongs to Skylands for 7 minutes
*Espeon now belongs to Skylands for 3 minutes
<drf|work> they leave that to people who actually know how to do it
<drf|work> like Intel
<Airwolve> try and fail
<Airwolve> *cough*
<drf|work> XD
<drf|work> still
<drf|work> there's no such thing as a "Microsoft built computer"
<drf|work> you'll have parts from other places
<drf|work> Apple, on the other hand, just brands everything - both hardware and software, as theirs
<Airwolve> anything hardware MS do is conceptual, they give it to people who can do it to actually do it
<RP4L|Art> 5All my friends that have Macs are all, "But Macs (even though they're more expensive) last way longer than PCs and never have ANY VIRUSES or ANY PROBLEMS and blah blah blah..."
<drf|work> yep
<drf|work> LOL RP4L, yeah, but you'd be surprised
<Arcanine> 04o-o
<Aristeo> What's a tag? :o
<RP4L|Art> 5Is it true that Macs can't get viruses?
<Airwolve> makes me want to get a mac just to write a virus for it, almost
<drf|work> Nope.
<Airwolve> they can quite easily, there just aren't any (yet)
<drf|work> there are viruses
<drf|work> lemme find this pic
<drf|work> no, there are
<drf|work> just not very common
<Airwolve> *many, then
<drf|work> but if you get like, pirated software
<drf|work> it's common to see viruses
<Corevette789> User limit
<RP4L|Art> 5I think as Mac gets more and more popular they'll have more viruses and bugs.
<RP4L|Art> 5The problem with PC and MS is that the company pushes the makers to get stuff updated and out there /really, really fast/ and never give the producers time to work out all the bugs.
<Airwolve> need to create a cross-platform virus so it can spread harmlessly via windows machines, hop onto linux servers, then OHMNOMNOM all the macs
<Aristeo> /mode #channel +l 30
<RP4L|Art> 5I like that idea Airwolve. xD

*LugiaLordOfTheSeas runs more
<drf|work> SerialFloof	Sorry if I am distracted, I have Arti Art to look at XD <-- I must say, that sounded completely inapropriate
*drf|work hides
<ultraman> when you partition you hdd part to fat32 and the other left as raw do you then format the raw to wbfs?
*SerialFloof leaves LLOTS and stalks DRF >>
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I is free!
<Articuno> 12LOL
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14:D
<SerialFloof> And no, not the best, but if I serial killed the whole time I was awake I would need to move from town to town every week for population density sake ;p
<ultraman> or is the other partion formated to ntfs before you can format it with wbfs?
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14LOL
<Shadowabsol> 14Hmm... Cereal Floof....
<SerialFloof> ...
<SerialFloof> don't you dare!

<ultraman> huh?
<SerialFloof> LOL! XD
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14xD
*Shadow_Lugia 6read that as SareiiFloof. ovO
<DasTier> "is formatted before you can format it to what you want" <= What do you expect? Nasty harddisk gnomes disobeying your orders?

<Guest1186192> 06purple is beast

<Shadow_Lugia> 6The closest match was found through an imageshack link on Google.
<KyroTheAssassin> wb?
<Chimera> z:E
<Chimera> yus thanks
<Articuno> 12Whats wrong with using avatars from the internet ??
<Shadow_Lugia> 6It belonged to someone else.
<Bloatedfish> i love the way the profile says she's 13
<Articuno> 12So??
<KyroTheAssassin> np
<Articuno> 12It's not stealing..
<Shadow_Lugia> 6SaturnGirl, specifically.
<Articuno> 12It's an avatar...

<Kipikipo> Depends on two things
<KyroTheAssassin> i made a temporarp Assassins Creed Costume
<Articuno> 12Saaaaaaad
<Kipikipo> One: is it a free avi
<KyroTheAssassin> temporary*
<Kipikipo> Two: If not, is credit given
<Kipikipo> :P
<Articuno> 12I'm sorry but an avatar.. to me is Not art theft..
<Articuno> 12It's not been edited at all.. not been claimed as someone else's..
<Articuno> 12It's just a picture found on the internet like everyone elses
*KyroTheAssassin wants Soyuz & Chimera's opinion
<Chimera> kay
<Chimera> Show the pix
<TimeShift> but then again, she used it by uploading it onto another webspace - imageshack
<Articuno> 12Technically I didn't say TimeShift could edit the picture I made for him NOR use it as an avatar, but I'm not saaad.
<KyroTheAssassin> this one is the dark one
<KyroTheAssassin> http://i.imagehost.org/view/0025/DSCI0020
<Kipikipo> I think that would fall under the first thing then, Arti.
<Articuno> 12She probably found it, said OMG what a nice picture! Saved it, then decided it would be nice to use as an avatar
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Oh, yeah; you saw Mamepato's evolution, Arti?
<Articuno> 12NO

<Articuno> 12...........
<Airwolve> A 3D artist is paid a few hundred pounds over the modelling of an asset from a game, then after game is released, model is extracted and used by some noob for their own purposes. Is it justified if said artist gets annoyed that their effort is being exploited in such a way?
<Articuno> 12I can barely see it V_____V
<Shadow_Lugia> 6:/

*Andres was all "Why the hell would Facebook recommend the Andres to add someone as a friend whose pictures is all Justin Bieber?" and then came here to report it.
<TimeShift> anyways - someone reported it and liked to an artist claiming he/she

<KyroTheAssassin> ???

<KyroTheAssassin> 05Quoted from www.fmylife.com : Today, as I was standing in the checkout line, waiting to pay for my groceries, I heard someone breathe in...very loudly, in my ear. I turned around to see a guy sniffing my hair. He beamed at me and stated, "You always smell so good." I had never, in my life, seen this man. FML

<sexual> your weird korean setup might be interfering with the vc/wiiwares
<sexual> yes there is just google it
<viince> R8 is latest afaik
<sexual> doesnt blinking mean that it wants to tell you there is an update?

<SamWalton> here at Walmart, we treat customers better than ourselves
<InfamousZed> ha told at teh register to gift wrap my chocolate milk i bought
<xdpirate> Alex63456, maybe you have a wrong region version for your console
<Athenon> np
<InfamousZed> yesterday
<SamWalton> XD
<xdpirate> i.e. you have pal and are trying to run an ntsc game without forcing pal video mode
<Stormy> lololol
<InfamousZed> and he just stuck the recipt to the side of the bottle
<Lambda> XD
<Lambda> Was it a coworker?
<xdpirate> some games won't work even though if you do this
<InfamousZed> yeah sorta
<Lambda> Or different shift?
<Stormy> But seriously they should promote me to manager of electronics
<Athenon> wtf
<InfamousZed> dont think they have a manager of electronics
<Alex63456> I believe it is correct region, ripped from actual game through cfg
<Lambda> If I were the reincarnation of Sam Walton I would
<Stormy> They'd probably pay me a ton more
<Proto> Hello nyte
<Athenon> greattttt there goes our rules bot
<InfamousZed> they only have supervisors and comanagers then the store manager
<Lambda> but what would you do once school starts :(
<InfamousZed> shed pay for college
<Stormy> oh yeah
<Stormy> true
*Quanyails 7blinks
<xdpirate> hm, that's weird
<Stormy> Can't really be a part time manager
<Quanyails> 7That nick reminds me of the other Cynder. O3o
<Lambda> in another town
<xdpirate> have you tried running the game with another loader? maybe you got a bad dump
<Drake> 04lol
<Drake> 04hey Quan
<Lambda> 2.5 hours away
<InfamousZed> whats interesting is that a store manager can get upto almost a half/quarter million in bonus when the year's bonus comes around
<Stormy> I was thinking of the one near school, but OK :P
<Quanyails> 7Hey, Ly.
<xdpirate> if it doesn't work on other loaders something may have gone wrong, try cleaning the disk and doing a new rip
<Lambda> oh okay

<Quanyails> 7Wanna see what I'm trying to arrange for a piano? :P
<Lambda> I thought you meant the awesome electronics department you have up there
<InfamousZed> he thought i might be interested in moving up as a career
<Drake> 04uh...sure?
<Alex63456> Listen, I
<Lambda> O.O
<Alex63456> am almost certain is is because of M+
<Lambda> He offered you a prmotion?
<CobraX83> any way someone can please send me cios 223 v5 base 37 made in a wad?
<InfamousZed> no
<Lambda> aww
<InfamousZed> just showing me the ropes
<Lambda> I see
<bb-q> go fish
<Alex63456> I think I need something
<CobraX83> I need it in order to follow this rb2 guide to get all my dlc to play off the hd
<CobraX83> and i guess music games in general
<Stormy> I definitely don't want to work there the rest of my life
<sexual> Alex63456 you need to run wiisports resort once with alt.dol to play the video till its done a save game
<InfamousZed> cause apperently i'm one of the only people that does more than my job...
<Quanyails> 7Ah, before I send you the link: have you heard of chiptune?
<sexual> and then turn alt.dol off again
<Drake> 04...nope
<Stormy> But I wouldn't mind a promotion as it would pay more
<CobraX83> ya u will watch the wiimote proper use video and reboot
<bb-q> heh turn the volume down though
<InfamousZed> eh with a promotion comes crap from the [censored] hill
<CobraX83> sexual can u please help for a min i need cios 223 v5 base 37 wad
<Lambda> yep
<Sub|Tetris> 10zomg orange
<Sub|Tetris> 10hello person
<Lambda> the crap rolls downhill
<sexual> why v5
<Lambda> the only one immune to it is whoever owns Walmart
<InfamousZed> crap goes down hill and when you go up it your gona have to fight against it
<CobraX83> in order to use uloader
<sexual> v4 got better support except you use uloader
<CobraX83> this guide i am following says to get it
<Nyte> hi
<Quanyails> 7Hey?
<sexual> ah lo
<sexual> why do you want uloader, its ugly ;p
<Stormy> I'd never get promoted anyway only working part time. XD
<CobraX83> http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:FCZwAUYhnOMJ:gbatemp.net/t237966-tutorial-rockband-2-ntsc-dlc-all-songs-on-hard-drive%3Fview%3Dgetnewpost+rock+band+dlc+opn+hard+drive&cd=2&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us
<sexual> its good but ugly
<InfamousZed> i dont even think the waltons own a majority of shares in walmart anymore
<Stormy> I mean, I'm full time now, but when school starts I won't be
<Lambda> yeah
<CobraX83> ummm
<sexual> ah thats why
<CobraX83> bc i need it to point out to hd for dlc
<sexual> heh
<CobraX83> for rock band 2
<InfamousZed> you gona try for a transfer to your college grounds?
<CobraX83> this i swhat the guide says
<sexual> well just grab the cios222 v5.1 installer
<CobraX83> any other loader allow that
<Stormy> I'm going to try
<CobraX83> ?
<Lambda> which works perfectly because the Walmart here wants all the 1st and 2nd shift people to become part time
<Stormy> And also apply at some other places
<bb-q> rockband is overrated anyways
<InfamousZed> better buy your dad's car and get a license
<Stormy> Anything to avoid the freaking cafeteria
<sexual> the guide even links you to the cios installer
<Stormy> there's a bus
<Lambda> And a Lambda
<Lambda> Don't forget the Lambda
<Stormy> :P
*Quanyails 7pokes Drake back in TST.

<Lambda> Lambda express is awesome
<Stormy> owo
<Drake> 04and it makes absolutely no sense to me'
<InfamousZed> and avoid any of the wispering going on in the background
<Lambda> she'd as far in in my inner circle as you can get so she'd be the one I'd be whispering to
<Quanyails> 7Okay? Well, you know what a synthesizer sounds like, right?
<Lambda> ...if that makes sense
<InfamousZed> nah i think im too far out there with that joke

<Lambda> Ooh, BlueFlame has three new eggs to click
<Lambda> pet proxy?
<Lambda> O.o
<Quanyails> 7http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iObGdsAY160 <-- That, Lyon. :P
<sexual> CobraX83 no
<CobraX83> sexual it says i need cios 223 v5 base 37 but with the 5.1 loaded i dont see the option
<Quanyails> 7So, yeah.
<MC-Joe> can i make apps i see on Homebrew channel as regular channels?
<xdpirate> Athenon, gc controllers work with both vc games and gc games tho?
<InfamousZed> to go where no one has gone before with total anonymaty
<CobraX83> starts off ios 259 i went through them i dont see a cios 223
<xdpirate> contemplating whether i should buy 2x classic controllers or 2x gc controllers
<CobraX83> i mean 249 sorry
<CobraX83> but i dont see it here for an option
<CobraX83> cios 223 v5 base 37
<EpicStatsGuy> : / : / :3 / : / : / E: / : / : / :
<sexual> if youd read carefully ud see that it asks which ios to USE
<sexual> for the installation
<sexual> so you select 249
<Drake> 04oic Quan
<CobraX83> oh sorry thank u
<Lambda> ah
<xdpirate> any games that supports classic controller and not gc controller, or are they interusable within virtual console and supporting wii games?
<Quanyails> 7There's two main melodies most of the time and two harmonies. O3o
<Quanyails> 7So, I tried two pianos, but then there's a part with three harmonies.
<CobraX83> i got a es decrypt error bad hash sexual
<CobraX83> i tried 223 with 37
<CobraX83> it went to inistialize network and returned that as error
*Lambda wished he was faster at clicking lots of eggs and Pokemon
<InfamousZed> the more you poke the eggs the better chance youll poke a hole in them
<Lambda> lol
<Cynder> 04...:|
<xdpirate> I don't play any GC games (atleast not until GC USB loading works), should I get 2x GC controllers or 2x classic controllers? I love the GC controller layout but haven't had a chance to try classic controller yet
*InfamousZed imagins lambda pokeing at a poke egga saying "hey... wake up..."
<Lambda> Hahaha
<Lambda> Stormy, I see you're breeding Rattata
<Stormy> no
<Lambda> trying to get the Adamant acheivement?
<Stormy> I'm breeding Gulpin
<Lambda> Oh
<CobraX83> sexual any clue that didnt work for me
<Stormy> I'm taking the rats from the Shelter
<Lambda> well
<CobraX83> it gave me a bad hash error
<Lambda> collecting Rattata then

*Lambda has the IceChat smilies turned off
<Animals> xdpirate: i like GC controllers myself (i use wavebirds). classic controllers might be better if you dont have wireless GC controllers
<CobraX83> i used wiiflow before but now i made the drive fat32 and use the cfg everything is working in that one
<InfamousZed> (hh)
<Austin> !addtrig join wiihelpjoin if chan == '#wiihelp' and nick != var.me and ison('IOS61',chan) == False: putserv('NOTICE %s :Welcome to #wiihelp. If this is your first time here, please check the rules by saying !rules in the channel.' % nick)

<sexual> and the main menu by pressing "1" once or twice
<Austin> :p

<Animals> yea, i find the gc controller to be very comfortable, i guess its just a matter of preference
<Animals> they layouts are different
<InfamousZed> looks like a tasty sammach to me
<Austin> !rules
<sexual> then it will tell you @ the bottom the version
<Lambda> mmm
