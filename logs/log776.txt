I'll volunteer
Whole channel

Mute me :P
lol
08,01huh, i got the command the wrong way round
I'm going to guess by the distinct lack of picture on the stream that there is no stream?
so, =madri is a whole chat mute?
+*
AJIsAwesome, nah. i think to mute 1 person for the whole chatroom
weeping_pegasi82: Wrek's getting things set up again. :)
Refresh!
ah, thanks
Stream is back, maybye.
Refresh for adjusting madness

08,01like a selective +m
Finally :)
but the pic is weird
Right side of video is a bit odd
Wrek: sort of gittering
I'm not sure if I like that or not.... :S
08,01it's by hostmask too, so i coudl theoretically silence a whole ISP
AJIsAwesome: you could say its bot

08,01Kandarihu: well, not really; i'd jsut ban them
05there goes!

+q is k-line right?
08,01yes it did
Lol, no twilight_sprinkle
08,01k-line is a server ban
o, +q is mute then?
08,01so if you try and even get onto the server, you get booted
/me missed the whole episode because he meant to have Firefox closed out until the virus scan finishes, but oh well.
The flame is stuck :<

Spamish2: they did in a movie once
I LOVE THIS EPISODE!
so the dog doesn't get a name...
Wre2
Panda: practicing shit loads? hows it going?
Wrek: well thats racist
05read the signature
You have to admit, they got along greatly for the time
Wrek: "Don't you believe it"
05his name's butch
Wrek: Well, Tom would talk, but not that frequently.
weeping_pegasi82: i did'nt know that
There's an episode where Tom is singing while playing piano
xD that peace stuff is just ridicolous
this show is FUCKING AMAZING
BITCHS
they're reasoning was that they could talk the whole time but had no reason to
Canebridge Theres a movie i think too where both talk
and thats what we call a threeway-relationship
damn you random person :I
Dark_Horst: ......
The characters have mental problems now ? :u
dat ass
AJIsAwesome: B)
this uy
this symbolism
05all soudn effects are made by musical instruments most of the time
05i love it
Drinking milk requires a toothpick... Odd.
over the rainbow?
Wrek: Same here.
classic cartoons will always be better than what comes out today
weeping_pegasi82 seems so
I saw a behind-the-scenes video where they covered the SFX used to make the episodes.
table flip!
sort of...
Sound + Music does everything is this serie
Panda, depends on the further development of cartoons. you never know what will be in a few years ^^
oh wow, this guy just came in and just randomly type while i was afk :I
kapow
your teeth are gone
08,01the dog is going to *eat* the cat?

What the

Canebridge: If you're trying to get work done while on Brony State, Brony State will always win.
oh... what was all that I heard about bronystate being hacked last pony stream, i wasn't here
The site wasn't hacked, the livestream was hijacked.
Pinkies_imagination: It wasn't, the stream client was hijacked
how did it get hijacked???
oooh!
bye snakes on a plane
I leave, good bye everyone, have a good day (or other)
>_>
ed, ed and eddy?
<_<
I haven't seen this in ages!
Pinkies_imagination: Didn't take too long to fix, they just switched clients. There was a problem with Mips that makes it easy to hack, so we don't use it anymore.
Bye, Spamish2. :)
don't kill me... but i have only ever seen... ONE episode of ed ed and eddy
bye Spamish2

I can't wait till the end.
I didn't mind this era of Ed, Edd, and Eddy.

Google didn't make me wiser - What the edd is Flönk?
I know, but I've met some people who didn't like this era.

Cancer.

ah
evil is dead
gah.... I hate editing my first fic... Every time I try it takes forever... and all I can think is... wow.... I used to be THAT bad at grammar?
Nope, somewhere around 2007, the TMNT CGI movie was the last of his work before cancer got the best of him.
Pinkies_imagination: know that feel, but i dont write fanfics :D
VenHur: evil is dead
I learned that shaving with a straight razor is a bad idea if youre just starting to shave O__O
y
Kipkat07_USAF: you could cut an artery?
I know, which is why i'm not used to making fictions, you see, the secret of making fictions so popular is how innovative it is, something that the public never seen before.
Originality and innovation are what makes fictions so special about them.
I have a neckbeard so it was highly likely. Thats why I alway keep a bottle of rubbing alcohol and a few gauze patches on hand when I shave
You just gotta' put some brains into the olde noggin.
Dear Princess Celestia, I learned that humans have quite a lot of blood
lol
but I did get cut 3 times and once was on the neck :'(

NIce. Id love to have some merch but couldnt explain it to people who ask.
08,01oh cool, actual lesbians on TV

Sleep?
What is this sleep you speak of? .-.
08,01and they're recording the sleep of this lady who has sleep problems
Lol sleep
08,01it's so bad that it stops her girlfriend sleeping
/me laughs at sleep
08,01she screams and shouts in her sleep
That sounds aweful!

08,01I WANTS TO FLUFF IT
http://d24w6bsrhbeh9d.cloudfront.net/photo/5941227_700b.jpg
Chainsaw crossbow, best idea ever.
Dark_Horst: that retinal reflection makes poor kitties look evil :(
this is the one thing missing in gaming
08,01Dark_Horst: that's a bit gory for posting in here
I dont think modern materials for bow string would allow that.
08,01but i'll let you off this *one* time because it was hilarious
whats with the links? its illegal on this site, right?
Dark_Horst: Serious Sam and Painkiller come close XD
08,01i suppose i *did* stream an episode of Elfen Lied
Dead or alive?
08,01oh aye, and Dead Alive
YES DEAD ALIVE!
08,01but there were warning attached to both of those
^ yeah warnings
^true
alexxm|foal: hmm not sure :$

Sketch_Toku i think bruce cambell would be a good zenigatta
Did mips ever respond to their security hole?

>9gag
get out
Engi: or you shut up
OMG!! My boyfriend just told me that he might get to compete in the 2016 olympic games!!
i dont give a shit where it'S posted. it's funny. that's what i give a shit about. why dont you?
seriously, gie me a good rason
fillyfillyy: wow, good luck to him ^_^
Dark_Horst: Thats funny
08,01heh, spot the redditor
13LE LE LE LE LE LE LE LE LE LE
08,01Dark_Horst: dude, HTTP 420
08,01evenin' pony_7158
08,01Dark_Horst: enhance your calm.
i am calm?
wait
you confuse me
08,01Engi was just making a joke, i'm sure
08,01don't go off on one about it
im afraid he wasnt
08,01well, pretend he was, then
08,01he's not said anything further about it
She expressed some disdain for your taste in recycled and watermarked images, is all
thing is, happens everytime. as soon as there's 9gag in the url, somebody starts btiching. and as of yet, nobody managed to explain to me why
08,01well, 9gag is kinda shit
13LE LE LE LE LE LE LE LE
13LE ME LE STREAMING SOON
08,01for the reasons Engi said
Engi: so why give a shit where it's been and not been? why care?
08,01recycled imaged, watermarked, no real original content, horrible userbase, basically 9gag is the new ebaumsworld
because they claim it as their own
couldnt care less
i never read the comments anyway
08,01Dark_Horst: look up and listen to the song Ebaumsworld.com by Trapezoid (Lemon Demon)
i go there, browse, find amusing stuff, done
browniestaet stahp
08,01Dark_Horst: they basically steal content to make ad revenue
08,01that's kinda shitty
Enjoy some awesomeness instead ;~; http://fav.me/d5j72lh
08,01and, of course, because they're re-encoding, it's shitter quality too
then tell me where it comes from so i can look there
4chan and reddit both produce deent amounts of OC
08,01Dark_Horst: that's the thing; often you can't tell. one way to find out is to use google image matching
*decent
08,01drag the image onto google image search and try and find that
stolen content or not, it's easy to browse and appearantly collects form multiple sources into one adress
easy access
08,01linking the original is preferrable if you can find it
13oh fmle...
and the content is fun anyway
13why you suck so much...
08,01alexxm|foal: funnyjunk can suck mine
13anyway you can hit play now
been on funnyjunk. not that funny
/me 08,01hits play; breaks computer
08,01funny junk isn't actually all that bad; they pay for and create original content
13let me know when everyone sees fire
I see the fire
i see fire!
Its needs to be hotter though.
11,02Computer is on fire, wut do?
well, i could go to 4chan, but msot of that stuff is reposts too nowadays
also, i'd have to go through tons of crap before i find somehting funny
SuperBrony64: hit f4 backspace
Haha
let the 9gaggers do the sorting for me
Oh my
Back
08,01SuperBrony64: you got the drivers when you installed fire

Well, when I started watching a movie, Wrek was streaming Samurai Jack, or something. When I come back, Shizuka's streaming Haruhi. Cool stuff
so bunnysuit girl is the key to human evolution?
Kandarihu: Goddamn combo breaker.
13much worse twilight_squirtle
hey Kandarihu or should i say Kangiskanrihu? :D
We're all nicknaming ourselves after Pokemon? Fine.

this is my face when im watching the boresst thing ever
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/#f/2748/

Oh ive played that game!
ITSUKI, THAT SEXY BASTARD
Very fun :)
.........
13pause for dramatic effect
I'm straight, btw
-.-
Kyon's all "dafuq"
twilight_squirtle, I see. Awesome.
sounds like a goal in Pinkies life :D
Even Yuki is visibly shocked
13hm
0///0
inb4 clop
O//////O
I showed this to my mother. She HATES Haruhi for her treatment of Mikuru.
/me drinks Cappuchino
Watch this, Kyon's not even trying.
O////o
oh god 0_0
THAT LAST PICTURE WAS PLOT IMPORTANT
great timing indeed
MIKURU'S BOOBS ARE PLOT IMPORTANT
o///o
o_O
And no, I'm not kidding.
oh god that didnt look right 0_o
allright grow up
Aww, I was missing Haruhi :(
13no spoils filly
LOL, Itsuki's all "continue with the illegal sexual acts"
13"carry on"
Pretty much
Even worse, I missed the Asahina episode :'(
i'll be honest, this Haruhi girl makes me angry
DUTCH ANGLE
why does she remind me of selena gomez
Bloody Dutch....
XD
This anime would never have worked if it wasn't for Kyon.
Haruhi greatly improves her personality in later installments.
shouldnt her haircut be different every day?
twilight_squirtle: lol more like Selena GOLEM :D ah jeez these pokemon nicknames rofl
She cut her hair off because plot.
13twilight_squirtle: it's the first major plot point
lol Sketch_Torkoal_Brony
13she *did* change her hair every day
13but then she met kyon
o_O
hi everypony :)
DAMN, Mikuru is tiny
dat suzumiya haruhi no juutsu :3
She looks way too much like a child :S
08,01you know what this country need?
ponies
Go on
08,01we need a prime minister with a BLOODY GREAT BEARD
the answer is always ponies
The only thing childish about her is her face and height.
Oh, YOUR country
She's got massive knockers, though.
i wonder if Mikuru's VA is the JP Fluttershy? she would fit so well!
08,01A BLOODY GREAT BEARD AND MASSIVE KNOCKERS
08,01\o/
XD
XD OH GOD
13mikuru is infodumping the wibbly wobbly timey wimey ball
MY SIDES
so Squeeky McFondlefont is a time traveler?
Shizuka: Dat Doctor Wgo reference.
what is happening
*who
08,01Major: our women can beat up all your men
13Alchemist: haruhi wanted to meet aliens, time travelers, and psychics
13yuki nagato is an alien
13mikuru asahina is a time traveler
08,01Sketch_Torkoal_Brony: we need roy mustang's daughter
and she does
and almost destroys everythuing
13so just guess what the other guy will be
and i bet that other guy is an alien too
lel
:P
Haruhi suzumiya is basically the anime equivalent of Doctor Who. But with less traveling and more tits.
A fairy, by the looks of it :3
08,01Shizuka: do you have a bloody great beard?
/me 13looks down
08,01if not, find some heair.
08,01*hair
13nope
08,01oh god, shizu
08,01YE GODS
13my wizardly locks are on the back of my head not the front
13you wizards are so backwards
08,01you just gave me this mental image of you... giving yourself a beard
08,01scissors
wow Mikuru's story is BETTER than FF 13-2's story :D

Shizuka: werent there shorts on Haruhi? i remember a cooking one that make me rofl
Yes, Haruhi-chan Suzumiya!!
Beware of the moe blob. She skips and cries...
Fan yourself.
Beware of the moe blob. She's a manipulative bitch.
13cachi01: You should know better than to discuss rule 34 here.
yeah i keep forgettin that :I
sowwy
13You had better remember.

Hearing that book ttitle makes me want to read "To Kill a Mocking Bird"
esper?

13psychic
ESPer
ah
13^
sounds like some kind of phantom arachnid
Dang it, why didn't I see that? ESPer -_(\
"Koizumi, is there something you wanna tell me?" "Yes, it's as you've guessed... I'm gay." "Actually I'm talking about how you're an esper." "Oh yeah, that too."
cachi01: lol idk :3 the others might
Hello Everypony :)
cachi01: long story, it began from discussing what +q is, then what the q stands for, then we started sayign words with q, then adding q's to words, then i became squirtle
ESPer is a very old sci-fi term. It fell out of use nearly everywhere except in Japan.
Hey there, Cypresswolf
13so... haruhi is inception
13BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRM
hi Cypresswolf
God knows
So I might be able to get a latptop next week :3
how've you been Cypresswolf
Esper has actually come back into use thanks to Haruhi Suzumiya.
so the lean mean grope machine is some sort of godlike reality bender?
Haruhi is the differentiated ideoblast. (And you get bonus points is you get that reference).
Polydunami: i see what you did there
Shizuka: :D now im remembering that chocolate-ception from spongebob
What sorts of shenanigans have I miss out on todya? :)
this show keeps getting more twists than a bread bag tie
13it gets worse :3
^
Shizuka: Yay~?
Just you wait
Wait until the next episode.
13the crazy gets turned up to 12
:3
:D cant wait
Only 12?
O-o\
I shall say nothing else.
Shizuka: Yay
:) I like crazy
~
let me guess, it's only at 3 or something now
btw what was the episode where the world is invaded wit aliens but only haruhi and the boy i cant remember his name are on that world and shit happens?
Haruhi is a fickle god who doesn't realize that she's a god.
12 of them?
She's not a God.
Let the torture begin.
Third chronologically, Buytoast, yes.
Hi
theres no haruhi
only zuul
i meant the crazy level
Whos streaming right now?

oi Malmortius u better calm your tits
Malmortius: She's cycling between this, Haruhi, Rozen and Spongbob. Cool your tits.
Fine fine.
Nothing much. Just disappointed that my made up simulation hockey league which took an insane amount of preparation for this year is all set and has actually started pre-season, and the NHL and the NHLPA still hasn't managed to come to a deal to end the lockout yet. >->
spongebob is best anime
13BIRD BIRD BIRD BIRD BIRD

Hai Nittany_Discord :)
13hai nittany you missed mikuru in a maid outfit
Hi, Nittany_Discord. :)
Hello Nittany_Discord
uguu
Shizuka: Episode zero of Haruhi?
Nittany_Discord: Holla! :)
13guess there was that too
13playing chronologically though so 3
134 next
More like 10
08,01i want a utility kilt
GilDash: things have been quite busy here too - might have to move out by January for house renovations
lol crap on u
This is the highlight of my day.
Cypresswolf: Yeah, I'm currently sleeping in a room with plaster dust on the floor.
is the lockout supposed to be because of wages again?
08,01my boyfriend is being an arse
08,01wait
Cypresswolf: The walls won't be painted for another week and fuck knows when the carpet's arriving. XD
08,01i think i already moaned about that
08,01CARRY ON, BRONSTATE
<3
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Drawfriend Stuff #638
GilDash: living on a jobsite? I've been there before :P - be thankful the roof over tour head is stable, this house is practically falling apart - Roof replacement is 1st on the list
Cypresswolf: This is the third time in as many years.
Yeah, pretty much.
Kana is choking! Don't everyone get up all at once
why are they all angels
lol its always wages.
5-10 million isn't enough.
ikr
GilDash: I dont have a backup place to stay yet, have been offered to move back in with my parent til the renovation is done, but like to move to Galveston - can't take my cats with me, if I want to rent out their house there
you're right, it isn't
Cypresswolf: I'm living with parents, so I don't even have that choice. I've been without a room for 10 months now. XD
GilDash: Roughing it?
08,01i live in the largest room in my parents' house
your mom has a nice house
:P
08,01unfortunately, before i moved back in with them, they were using the room as a storeroom
08,01and have nowhere else to put that stuff in
Cypresswolf: Aye. Was living on a blow up air bed for that time. Went through 3 of them.
08,01i literally don't have the space to walk from the door to my bed
13looks like someone fireballed an oblivion house there
08,01i need to jump over a pedastel table to get into bed
08,01Vordox: not really, no
Reminds me of Hostess
08,01but it's my only option to afford going to uni
GilDash: that give me an idea - never thought of camping :) - I could live in the old trailer for awhile, I could stay here and work on the house in the meantime
I like twinkies :P
I had to move back in with my grandmother after college.
Shizuka: yes the pshysics in oblivion are amazing in that way
http://www.ebay.com/itm/WOW-Hostess-Twinkies-10-Count-Box-Golden-Sponge-Cake-with-Creamy-Filling-SHIPPED-/321030147372?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item4abee34d2c
Cypresswolf: Yeah, camping out here isn't really an option. I honestly could sleep on the hard wooden floor if needed. As long as I've got a sleeping bag and are sleeping somewhere sensible I'm fine.
13rakka's story is starting to kick in btw
I probably would do the same thing this guy is doing right now
I've actually never had a twinkie before
GilDash: I could sleep pretty much anywhere - I've slept in worse places - ever go on a cave tour where you go in so far, you have to sleep in and climb out the next morning?
so y do u all like ponies so much?
I hate ponies >_>
I wanted to get some when I heard on the news the company was closing up
Cypresswolf: No. 'Cause I'm not that kind of crazy. :p
MLP_Brovakiin: then y u here?
Went to the store and almost everything was gone
We don't like ponies! >_>
XD
Cypresswolf: Outdoors isn't really my forte.
oh
pony_364627: I was about to ask you the very same question.
Couldnt get a twinkie :/
Guessing some people aren't gonna be happy about the company closing
I'm pretty sure the workers arent happy
MLP_Brovakiin: because i dont understand
its a girls show
Most of em agreed to not get raises
but one group didnt
they went on strike and now everyone loses
pony_364627: Not strictly true
^
GilDash: its not so bad, if you can over look the fact no sleeping bag provides any comfort when sleeping on flat hard stone
pony_364627: completely agree
It's quite accessible for a girls' show, laddie
summed up perfectly
Wow, are they really that good?
13psst
13so is this
Polydunami: Ewww Girls, shows :|
:S
Eww, Scoots. :3
girls' shows*
Cypresswolf: Considering some of the sleeping bags I've used were little more then sheets, yeah, I can kind of sympathise with you. XD
what? twinkies? they are tastey but it depends
0,5Asking these guys why they like ponies is like asking an alchoholic why he likes beer while he's drunk.
What kind of show made for girls would grown ups want? :P
I like em, but I don't know if id pay almost $20 bucks just for a box
so mlp is like vodka lol
im back :)
and yes it is like vodka
I use to buy 3 boxes for $6 at the store in the past
Because we just do BaconMane ?
but better
Welcome back cachi01 :)
Welcome back, cachi01. :)

pony_364627: yessir, it makes you act extremely awkward.

oh wow

Scoots! :3
i seen it its not very good
We don't like only ponies, as you can probably see on the stream.
i still dont gettit
GilDash: and then there's the darkness - imagine waking up, not being able to see anything, sweeping your hand around looking for your lantern and lighting blind
You better hope you don't get forced to unionize SR :P
pony_364627: neither do i
0,5Well, some people like cartoons.

The concept of sarcasm is wasted on kids today.
Polydunami: :P
P0N-3: it isnt a movie
But yeah, joke was in that ballpark.
Good thing all those hard jagged desks were there to break their fall...
You know what's worse than ponies? Bronies. I heard they made thier own state called Bronystate...

CriticKitten: Yeah, but if you die in a dream in Inception you're either booted out or lost in Limbo. It's the Matrix where if you die in the dream you die in real life.
srsly gais, when do u show mlp???? i want to see wat its like
Polydunami: lol a part of the Assassinolypics
Scoot-Scoolamence: fags :S
There's also this guy named Scoot-Scootaloo, he's a floozy mofo

Uncle Sam must be turning in his all MURIKAN grave.
Shizuka: play final fantasy 6
:3
hi Scoot-Scoolamence
pony_827767: We show MLP, but only at certain times/events. Usually during BMN and the new episode airings. Sumica also streams some pony stuff somtimes.
pony_827767: only saturdays and fridays
13pony_827767: You really can't read can you. It's 200 pixels above the stream.
You see, Jun, when you recycle your homework it becomes the grass. And the antelope eat the grass. Ergo, the homework is part of the Circle of Life....
Major: just joking
OooOOOOooo! We CAN say Scootaloo!

Shizuka hahahahaha
i thought u sumtimes show ponies
pony_827767: chatting and meeting other bronies
HIS HEART GREW THREE SIZES THAT DAY.
pony_827767: The FAQ explains everything.
YouTube was created in 1776 by Uncle sam as a way of promoting MRUKAN independance from the tyranny of the terroist country of Egypt.
thats y its called ponystate?
pony_827767: PONYSTATE?
We do after movies on Fridays and Saturdays.
pony_827767: There isn't. This site is completely pointless. :p
EWWW
DinkyDoo: Don't you mean that his heart grew "tree" sizes that day? *shades*
Ugh my tummy feels all lurchy and I'm all shakey.
Scoot-Scoolamence: this is Pokestate
I like her eyes the most :3
pony_827767: no. its called bronystate because we hate bronies *youdontsay.jpg*
im so confused lol
This is pokestate man
.-.
Right, pony_827767, I'll explain this in PM.
yep pokestate
Also, our purpose is to be a safe haven for MLG bronies so that they can be sheilded from the dreaded Ponies
thought this was zeldastate
>went into dream world with limited time available
Also I'm fine with PokeState~
>don't know how to get out
but i like pokemon also so its all good
horses are dangerous creatures
CriticKitten: lel
they consume small children
pony_827767: Its bronystate. Its like a gathering place for pony aficionados (not everyone here is a brony or likes that term, some are not even fans of the show) but new episodes show up on saturday on stream and fridays are movie nights
13suddenly character development
Are there many Berry-Punch-in-rehab fics?
.......
We also occaisionally do the blatantly impossible.
aniderp1: I wants a zeldastate ;3;
....did they HAVE to spawn under the blankets?
thank u tyhplonli-link

yes
That's better than spawning on top of a bunch of sharp desks

All I know about this is Desu and that's all Uncyclopedia. That's literally my knowledge of the entire show.
Yet another show about some poor Japanese kid who gets driven nuts by strannge magical bossy girls.
Why is this so nauseatingly adorable? This is making My Little Pony look like Ninja Scroll.
who is desu???
pony_827767: That and some of the mods stream pony-related things as well.
goddamn that was some creepy music
pony_827767: occasionally we get some pony stuff in at random. streams are pretty much set. saturday mornings are your best bet, you can watch the new episodes live
I'm out. Be back later
pony_827767: desu means I or he or she or that or it in japanese
Bye, Pol-
Gone.

08,01this is cute; it's like we have a pet now
but NEVER ask for pony too many times, otherwise we get punished
so they are dolls, correct?
cachikorita01: I thought it was like a term used to be polite
but she overdoes it
or something
pony_827767: Suiseiseki (kawaii girl with red and green eyes) always ends her sentences with desu
13YES
Are the surveys going to be late this week?

Shizuka: can you agree with me that, when we ask for pony too many times, we get punished?
08,01GilDash: a little
/me loves cheese balls
/me hugs Jeremiah
Desu-- literally, a form of address in Japanese referring to one self. It can me "I", or "Me", or "This One", or any of a number of similar things. For example, Wakarimasu Desu means "Yes, I understand", while Shizuka Desu would mean, roughly, "I'm Shizuka". Which, by the way, I'm not.
especially with bacon

Hard to tell between trolling and sheer idiocy these days it seems. XD

Hai Justin
Hi Justin :)
Hello Justin
Hiiiii guys.
What the cake is this

Isn't something as commonplace as a fireplace kinda pointless to have a simulation of?
Justin: hi

Justin: JINGLE BELLS
Bon_Bon: its the best of living fireplace
I took a picture with my cellphone, but I can't find my MicroSD/SD adapter.

ROBIN LAID AN EGG
Bon_Bon: magic
I wanna hear something by Bing Crosby.

Why isn't there pone songs, that would make the fireplace complete.
Kipkat07_USAF: Cooliio

THE BATMOBILE

Bon_Bon: cause pony songs are not so cool
Bon_Bon: naw, then the songs will get boring tbh

I wish it was colder here in Australia ;~;
aniderp, o.o

Is it weird that when I hear an Indian song I taste curry?
yea i was either mad and turned it on wondering and didnt know how to shut it off
Galatea. I believe it's greek.
i still wonder how you shut them off..
13with a fire extinguisher
GottaHugEmAll: naw its not
But the beat sounds more Idian-- Hindu, maybe?
Gah, stream is distracting me from my work :D
no there is a secret to it or something
maybe something near bottom where you turn it on
how so?
AdamTheDuck: if a fireplace is enough to distract you, youre in trouble :P
twilight_squirtle, the music actually :$
-stares at fireplace-
Makes me stop just to listen to it carefully.
Ah. Sudden En glish. It's from India almost for certain now. Don't know which movie-- and I'll bet it's from a movie.
no offense but the music sucks.
butler: you dont like it leave
butler, then mute and put your own music on then.
^
butler: why is it anytime people say no offense they really mean to sound like a complete asshole like you just demonstrated here
i paused it actually
do what the duck says :P
"sometimes i just stare into the flames and think about how small we all are"
oh im sorry
twilight_squirtle Harumph
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Music: Red Spy! / Fallen / Queen of the Changelings

thelonecubone, close enough, I guess
I'll come back when something else is streaming, okay?
yeah
13so no one identified the movie huh
13was Inside Man
Firee.
13borrowing Chaiyya Chaiyya from a movie called Dil Se iirc
Inside Man was awesome.
I LOVE THIS SONG.
Civilisaiton song? .-.
never heard of it
Civilization V song?
13swahili
:$
13singing the lords prayer as i recall
Please, Oh mighty stream, work.
xD
I had a Kenyan friend.
He was kind of a dumbass.
It literally is still broke
3rd time I refreshed
Cannot unhear the "Civilisation your own little nation" part :D
13yep :3
What if Civilization V theme had lyrics AdamTheDuck?
pony_9401 Whoah
Really? I didn't know that.
?
This is quite nice to a fireplace :3
I never heard the original song until now
As Meyer once apparently said, "Is there no greater sign of the Lord's hand that the very existance of Civilisation?"
is there a streaming schedule here? I'd like to suggest some vids.
I hardly play video games
Perfect
butler, nope, it's whoever is around and if they feel like it.
My live stream COMPLETELY broke now
pony_9401: what browser are you using?
butler: Basically, except for BMN and a few scehduled events-- well, anything could happen here. And often does.
ok
butler, occasionally we'll have things like Halloween gaming week
Wait we're calling it Brony Movie Night now?
nice
It was always called Brony Movie Night wasn't it? .-.
GottaHugEmAll: Hasn't it always been called that?
eeyup
I didn't know about this.
butler, usually when Wrek starts streaming, he streams for a LOOOOONG time. And this usually involves him playing a game for long periods or drawing ponies for long periods. But lately, he's also been streaming Cartoon Network shows.
You didn't? :D
I only started chatting on here like a month ago.
Me too
GottaHugEmAll: A MONTH? :O
But i picked up the pase :3
I thought you've been here a long time. :D
Yeah....Why?
wow! that's cool!
Weeell, there's a first time for everything.
I've been here since April, IIRC.
i started last week
Oh oh oh today is my BState cakeday!
I've been here before school started
This reminds me of Alice OST .-.
Sad that this was the only Pokemon reference I could think of.

Happy BState birthday, AttackWithHugs!
13mfw nopony knows what this is

Shizuka, you're being so obscure with your references.
So it's BronyState's birthday today?
Shizuka, NOPE. Chuck Testa.
08,01GottaHugE-mail
AdamTheDuck: for AttackWithHugs
hi
Ahh :$
Thank you....But it hasn't officially been a month yet..
aniderp: then you should rest it
Happy BronyState birthday then AttackWithHugs :P
nuu
Shizuka: is this from one of the games youve played?
Hello swack16
I actually started on the day of the season premier
I guess you're trying to find people who can get the same references are. If I were in your shoes, I'd be compelled to do the same thing, except with more obscure anime.
so what are we watching?
because I saw this website mentioned on EQD
i rarely sleep
swack16, a fireplace...
sounded a bit like myst back there, but not anymore
i prefer it on the big screen
GottaHugEmAll: Ballad Of the Brony led me here. :)
^
GottaHugEmAll: i found this site with the ^^
swack16, fireplace with music from movies Shizuka's discovered.
well you see
i was really fucking drunk
AJIsHaunter: he mentioned bornisteit?
GottaHugEmAll: Well, welcome to chaos. But nicer than usual and you don't get chocolate rain messing up your hair.
twilight_squirtle: Yep, at the end. :)
I just had an ovaltine milkshake
browniestaet
but i didnt wanted to come till the end of summer :$
By just had one I mean like two hours ago.
So what did I miss while I was taking care of my nephew?
AJIsHaunter: i see
:o
GottaHugEmAll, it's a nice chaos
I want Ovaltine
13everyone better at least know this one..
this is from ghosties in the shell ofc
moar Ovaltine
Yep, I know this one.
Oh, I hear Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex: 2nd Gig
I've never had Ovaltine before. ._.
this one sounds like GITS
Ghost int he Shell
It's called Rise :D
Ghost in the Shell
in the*
Shizuka: <3
AJIsHaunter: me neither
Awesome song
Would Discord like Ovaltine?
I regonise those vocals
But, I take it, a longer mkix, Shizuka ?
я бегу сразиться с тенью лжииЁ
AdamTheDuck: GITS SaC
*~
Ghost in the shell stand alone complex
GottaHugEmAll: of course, he would make it rain Ovaltine :D
more fire. somepony tell me when it's over.
Kencolt, it's the full version. The TV versions of almost ALL anime OP/EDs are shortened from the full versions.
Well, the song is called Rise, but yes, it's from GitS 2nd GIG
08,01what's an OP/ED?
13opening, ending
opening/ending
08,01ah

11,02i liek poniez~
ew.
11,02:<

Oh so yesterday I convinced my friend to get a blind bag with me when we went to WallMart in the middle of the night :D I'm trying to become more open with my brony-ness and I browsed the pink aisle with him and our other friends said, "What are you doing?" I said, "We're looking at the ponies" :>
/me gives CacturnalBlade glass of Ovaltine
man ive been blackmailing a friend to get me a blindbag pony for months now
could i have one? :3
and im back :3
wb cachikorita01 :3
o i see shizuka is streaming the whole season
/me noms on cachikorita01 :3
Welcome back, cachikorita01. :)
/me sets jar of Ovaltine powder on table
/me "Thanks GottaHugEmAll " drinks the glass and throws the Ovaltine away...it blows up behind him "haven't done that in a while lol"
So next time I go with him, we are getting those damn blind bags!! Not too happy that the ones there were the crystal series though

i feel like i have heard this before...hmmm?
twilight_squirtle: well I'm a noob at the blindbag stuff, care to explain?
was talking about stream
I know
But the voice makes you uncomfortable?
Typhloni_link: basically there used to be a way to tell which pony is inside the bag by the code on it, but idk if that works with the newer waves
Good Gil-oh damnit
Yay 8-bit wrap up!
Oh yes. That's right. Shizuka hates winter.
twilight_squirtle: is there like a list or chart I can look at? That would be really cool to see because I really want a Pinkie Pie

Shizuka we're alway uncreative..
Canadian_Brony: cause pokemon ftw
Fireplace is best pony.

Okay. Where the heck is this music from and where the heck has my SD card adapter gone to?
/me goes back to his 3DS to be Cheren in White 2

Cheren > N.
AttackWithHugs: you could just name yourself gottahugremall but somepony else already has that
gottahugemall*
cachikorita01, true.
DinkyDoo: I like em both
Typhloni_link: But Cheren is just more epic! Well, in Pokemon Black and White..
DinkyDoo: I liked Bianca more tbh
He had an epic Haxorus (I think thats how you call them?) in Pokemon B/W, but now he has just a bunch of weak normal types D:
long story Canadian_Brony ,it actually started from +q and then words that start with q
riiiight...
DinkyDoo: Hes the first leader now, thats why
Hi everyone!

and because it's better than watching paint dry
I FINALLY found the adapter. Hang on, I got an image to show you.
ILikePie I'm pretty good. A bit tired, but I have nothing productive to do, so it's all good.
Typhloni_link: I know that first leaders always have weak Pokemon..
Kecleondarihu: Okay. :)
Paint Dry is best villain
DinkyDoo: I was just complaing about it, not telling you. :/
Canadian_Brony: :) that is good to here! Same here..I having nothing else to do sense I had my wisdom theeth removed

Welcome back, NocturnalBlade. :)
NocturnalBlade: Why welcome back!
DinkyDoo: daccord
gunthler: R63 version?
Dovah: Doo him, all four of us, we gonna do him so hard he gonna feel it in the mornin when he wakes up!
WE HAVE RETURNED
AJIsHaunter: yesh :$
Kipkat07_USAF: Hi tehre!
Well guys, sadly, it's true...
o.o
DoctoDoctorWho: oh god, i have to go watch that now :D
What is, VenHur?
They ARE making a Home Alone 5.
Shizuka, I hear mellohi?
13far
:-)
Aaah
AJIsHaunter: CIDER
The Good News: It's a made for tv movie.
gee, bronystate, what do you want to do tonight?
I love Cider!
VenHur: I didnt know there was a four! What is this?
Nittany_Discord: It's the only way I can get through it
cachikorita01: Relax and enjoy life? :)
13so enlighten me ponies
13wtf is home alone
not the answer i was expecting
Shizuka: le gasp!
Shizuka: a movie
Shizuka: when you are alone at home BA DUM TSS
Got a brohoof from a home depot employee today. First IRL brony I have met.
For those that haven't - its about the animal in the manger the night Jesus was born - they get the gift to speak for one night, but spend most of their time argueing amongst themeselves - turn away Mary & Joseph when they come by - but invite them back when they realize why they were given the gift to speak
Got a brohoof from a home depot employee today. First IRL brony I have met.
Shizuka: a rather good movie
Shizuka: Kid gets left alone by accident, something goes amiss that involves him, they try to make it back home to the kid while the kid handles the problem himself basically.
Shizuka: bout a kid, gets left home alone, shenanigans insue
Shizuka, the first one is about....oh wait that means I'd be spoiling the movie
DISREGARD ALL I SAID
13uh huh..
Regard ALL you said!
Home Alone...there's a movie I havent heard of in years....can't remember much about it other than a kid is left home while family is on vacation and he defends his home from burglars
*sings* The sun goes down the stares come out
what Cypresswolf said ^_^
to think i'm playing Home Alone's song in band, "Somewhere in My Memory"
Shizuka: You're not showing signs of sarcasm, are you?
Cypresswolf: That... really, is pretty much it. That's prety much all there is to it.
nice haha
Shizuka: but then 2 pedophiles try to steal the kid
didnt they make more of them? 4 or 5 Home Alones?
But he does it in HILARIOUS ways. We're talking Coyote and Roadrunner levels of bad guy damage.
Home Alone 4 is the lastest one i think
and that's years old
it is
cachikorita01: I see.
its like 8 years old
Shizuka: It's about a kid, and his mom and dad forgot about him on some vacation, and from there on, hillarity issues.
Buytoast: They made a fifth one that was shown the other day
those 3 fanfics do not count
In a shocking twist, McCulley Kulcen is now the role of the burglar
wait
wut
Cant wait for Trixie
Shizu - pro tip - don't watch Home Alone 3 or 4
^
^^
VenHur: Not exactly forgot--they honestly thought he was there all along and only realised the case was otherwise halfway across the contenent.
3 Is fine, I liked it well enough.
Shizuka: If I may ask, do you have a playlist of this music you could share? This music is very nice. :)
Buytoast: they told kevin he could be anything he wanted
Buytoast: so he became a burglar
13AJIsHaunter: nope, randomly picking from my library
DoctoDoctorWho: never watch 4, its down right awful
cachikorita01: mfw my name is kevin
cachikorita01: So he became a bulbasaur?
lel
cratorkid: lol
Hello!
Shizuka: Okay. Just asking. :)
Hi, Valvad. :)
How'd you figure out he was a brony?
Dovah: *sigh* what happens?
hi Valvad :)
:)
hey Valvad
Shizuka: You should go see Home Alone 1 and 2, they're classics, and if you dared to proceed, then watch the nightmare that is 3 and 4...
DoctoDoctorWho: I dont know, was too busy bleaching my eyes after the first 5 minutes
Valvad: u new here? i've never seen you 'round this parts
I come here for live streams for New MLP episodes every saturday
VenHur, there are only two Home Alone movies. GET IT RIGHT.
Oh the spam time
soooo, what anime is everyone watching?
Inb4 Home Alone 6 is released another ten years later
cratorkid: living fireplace
I need to catch up with Detective Conan
cratorkid: this is the best episodes
On episode 650
just look at that majestic flame
lol
VenHur, if that ever happens I'll somehow find you and hurt you :)
Logs Burning With Background Music. I think it was created by Tezuka, cratorkid .
I can't imagine a home alone 6
Wait just looked at my Anime list, I am on 663
Might have been Matsumoto, tho-- the art style is kinda variant.'
Valvad: oh, so its one of those on going ones? those are botherrsome
Wait, i think i came in late, are they making a Home Alone 6?
13can't stand those... FMA was pushing it
AssaultWithEmbraces: Oh please do, my house is booby trapped. :)
Yea pretty much, No idea when it will end
13they want to pretend they have a story arc, but it never ends
NocturnalBlade, NO
Oh thank luna!
Also watching one pieve and reading Naruto and Bleach
One piece*
VenHur, Mister Krispies will be the first to go <3
13until you end up with something like death note where they keep ramping up the stakes and it stops being plausible
Shizuka: What about FMA:B?
Horrid and yet beautiful thought. Imagine Home Alone with a certain pony. Celestia help any burglars that try to rob TWILIGHT'S house.
13never saw it
FMA:B was beast!
AssaultWithEmbraces: No, anyone but Rick Krispies!
Shizuka: bleach was rediculuzz, and dont get me started on Naru-filler
Shizuka: You should, much better than FMA in my opinion
Oh god Naruto Fillers
Those are the worst
i remember when naruto had 2 filler seasons.....
Fillers were the exact reason I quit watching Naruto
What about DBZ fillers?
really
i dont watch it anymore, but my cousins keep me posted
Is that Miku I hear?
did they had to do that?
2 fucking filler seasons
VenHur: DBZ has something OTHER thah fillers?
And I couldn't keep up with the episodes coming out each week because I was behind so far
13for some reason this reminds me
13of all things
13encarta mindmaze
Awww
So I said "Fuck it. Rescue Gaara was enough"
minus the fillers naruto is pretty good, but the problem is they shove fillers in the form of flashbacks even in the non-filler eps
The fire and Song remind me of....
Hey Everypony
twilight_squirtle: exactly
Skyrim
AssaultWithEmbraces: lol, i forgot where i dropped Naruto
hi AssertiveFluttershy1
^^
twilight_squirtle: What about Bleach? That's filler central
encarta mindmaze :O That was fun game :)
whats goin on
13ATTENTION KAKAROT, MY HAIR IS OUTRAGEOUS
Hi AssertiveFluttershy1
Bleach fillers are not as bad as Naruto Fillers
i stopped watching naruto a little after shipudden started, i never really like action anime that much anyway
Naruto Fillers are flash backs of things you already know
Valvad: bhut the show can bore you to tears
Damn you kakacarrot cake
Kencolt: And people screaming for most of the episode! :P
exactly
otakon17: i watched some "le omg epic battlez!" of bleach on youtube, thought it was boring
Kencolt: yes, the plot is mixed deep in there, but its there.
^_^ I still have Encart 97 disc
YOU AM NO SUPER SAND!
Valvad: bleach, that is
13i tried putting encarta 99 on my VM
13but shockwave doesn't work anymore
i think i left naruto where he dreams with minato and minato telss him he is his father
13too old now
twilight_squirtle: It does get boring adter awhile
Yea I am reading the manga of that
Got tiredof the Anime
Tired of
Shizuka: How could Radditz even hold his head up with that massive hair? O__O
13encarta 99 was the best too cause it had all those animations
Naruto Manga is sooooo much better
Any one remember that one Cell moment?
Kipkat07_USAF: Because he's fabulous~
Oh yeah, I been there... :S
VenHur: There were many Cell moments. :D
Fairy tail is a good anime
Fairy tail is pretty good
Kipkat07_USAF: So that hair WAS compensating for something.
What was that last song?
13realmyst might work a little better, once you get through compatibility
Dis song from SKYRIM! :D
13and yeah at higher res riven gets a bit too small
i dropped naruto about 40 eps into shippuuden, as soon as i saw the first filler of shippuuden. i still follow the manga, altho its been getting worse the last few months. kishimoto needs to take a brake and stop making new chapters every week
Oddly, Nightmare Ned, around the same age, works fine
13took you long enough to detect skyrim
Not just ANY Cell moments, I was taking about THE Cell moment.
Shizuka: it juststarted playing for me
Afflict I was wearing my rainbow dash hat.
The one that gave me goosebumps for weeks...
13mm.. that far behind huh..
pfft How could i possibly not recognize skyrim?
I stopped with Shippuden shortly after the Great Ninja War or something of the sort. I couldn't find the time to read it again, and I haven't since.
and i wanna watch my little monster
yeah the great ninja war
Its getting very good >.<
AJIsHaunter: it got worse after pain died. pain was an awesome character, but then it got meh
fuck naruto looks like if its never going to end
how long has it been?
9 years? 8?
500 eps
Meanwhile in universe B, they had My Little Dragon.
VenHur: http://0-media-cdn.foolz.us/ffuuka/board/vg/image/1336/32/1336327991491.jpg
twilight_squirtle: Hmm, I'd wait until the end to see how it all turns out. But I loved the Pain saga.
VenHur, and How to Train your Pony?
that or Your Big horse Valvad
VenHur*
cachikorita01: yeah and its starting to have dbz syndrome and wont stop bringing every goddamn character back from the dead since a fwe months ago
Eeyup.
oh god really?
OH GOD ITS STILL BURNING!
That happends to me all the time
Jokes fly over my head
I got some Terra Glyph games - Rumplestiltskins Labrinth of the Lost & Hansel & Gretel....for windows 95...might play on vista...
hey how many saiyans do you need to change a lightbulb :3
cachikorita01: Yeah, Orochimaru/Kabuto is reviving the corpses of dead ninja, IIRC.
Alrgiht guys I am off
4?
just 1 but it takes 3 episodes
Bye, Karl. :)
and krillin dies in the process
Lol
LOLOLOLOLOLOL
seeya Karaoke
err
To those who don't know THE Cell moment, I'll remind you with one thing...
bye Karl
They need to power up before they have a chance in putting in the light bulb though
cachikorita01: Its funny cuz its true!
VenHur: SS2 Gohan?
twilight_squirtle: That wasn't the manga-person't idea. He honewstly wanted to end it with Goku's first death and move towards his son-- but his editors wouldn't let him.
Nappa, discuss
13also
Random Guy gets sucked up by Cell's tail.
Canadian_Brony: BYE!
ghost nappa
cratorkid: VEGETA! Hey, Vegeta!
Cya later
end discussion
13Cypresswolf: you know i have this right http://tkj.vortalcord.net/
AJIsHaunter: yeah and thats not all. i swear, i think theyve brought every single somewhat important character back from the dead at this point. kabutos technique is ay op for starters, and they never explained where he got all the chakra for it
Your welcome for your nightmare fuel.
13brain is still stuck in park on continuing though
AJIsHaunter: AREWETHEREYET
twilight_squirtle: Even the Third Hokage?
URU I havent played in awhile...2 months maybe - was still trying to find the time for the portal in the books in the museum
AJIsHaunter: well they did to some extent when narutos seal broke, he chatted with him for a bit. but they cant bring him back from the dead beyond that, he sealed himself
Shizuka: Your head is an amusement park?
13moula forums have a link to a portal calculator
AJIsHaunter: God dammit nappa...
13still accurate that i'm aware of
twilight_squirtle: Oh yeah, he DID do that in the first Naruto.
I want to see the Third Hokage vs Madara
Valvad: You mean Fourth? The third can't come back.
Third Hokage is dead last I recalled
AJIsHaunter: first? i was thinking of when his seal nearly entirely broke and minatos form or something appeared for a bit in narutos mind to prevent it from fully breaking
I know he died
obito. how the fuck did he survived the goddamn giant rock?
AJIsHaunter: waaaaaait
PillowPoni|Phone: Yep. Can't come back. He sealed himself.
derp
But its just something I would like to see
i was thinking of minato, whos 4th
AJIsHaunter, Fourth Hokage is dead too
who here uses Crunchy Roll
my bad :$
Shizuka: let me know when you play URU live again - I'll join :) - gonna go find my login info, see where I left off
AJIsHaunter: yeah i dont think they can bring 3rd one though, he also sealed himself :P
For some reason this brings to mind the fanfic "Friendship COntract." Twilight Sparkle for Haykage!
13i think all i had left was the pod donuts
Haykage
They're all dead except Tsunade, if I'm right. Ill ask my brother, he keeps up with this
LOL
lel tsunade is hawt
lel hinata is hawt
cachikorita01: yeah but that lava lady is even hotter
inb4 anime boobs
Yes all the Hokages are dead except Tsunade
lel almost every naruto girl is hawt
Tsunade is like over 50
PillowPoni|Phone: aaand? she is hawt
cachikorita01: more like every anime girl
ah
dont forget temari~
meh temari
But....50.
Mmmm
Ino :3
cachikorita01: Every Naruto girl is either hawt-- or flatter than a pancake. And still hawt.
cachikorita01: Actually, I think her appearance is catching up with her age, so she looks very old now.
meh ino
Hello fellow bronies :)
And she can literally beat the shit outta you if you piss her off
Hi, RDash5000. :)
hey RDash5000
Fireplace is best pony.
ino, hinata and tsunade :3
pain was an awesome character, his philosophy made a lot of real sense
Hello RDash5000
shizu fireplace?
DoctoDoctorWho: Goku is OP. Nerf now.
Pain was awesome
DoctoDoctorWho: comparing to DBZ again are we :|
DinkyDoo: Well, maybe G4 Fireplace. G2 fireplaces stank.
he sacrificed himself just to repair the damage he did
twilight_squirtle: What was the last form Naruto went through? Eight tailed?
i loved pains philosophy the most, i think it could legitimately work irl
How long is that fire place going to last?!?
DinkyDoo: FOREVER!
DinkyDoo: its been like that for 2 hours or 1
shizu fireplace is best fireplace
Npit 1 minute 3 seconds
Bout*
Valvad: loop
^
Ohhhhh
AJIsHaunter: you mean the last bijuu chakra form currently in the manga?
It's an eternal fire. It never dies. It's a thing of beauty and flame. It's also an AVI loop.'
^
twilight_squirtle: I was talking about in the Pain saga. After he killed Hinata.
ded chat is dedest chat
GTG everypony.
LOOP
Hinata didnt die :P
DoctoDoctorWho: been dedder
Bye, DinkyDoo. :)
bye DinkyDoo :)
seeya DinkyDoo
Bye everypony!
Bye bye
i cant remember the last anime i was into........ it should be either FMA or Death note.
Enjoy the eternal fire place!

Hey
Yes :)
Pluto is best Planet. :<
13http://i.imgur.com/yTpia.gif
Awwww!
daaaaw
AJIsHaunter: iirc he almost got to 8 tails, but then minatos seal prevented the eight tales from breaking loose, and after minatos jutsu was done, he had all his chakra back, was in control again so he went sage form and beat pain
hello every one

DoctoDoctorWho: you know nothing of magic!
/me hugs the Twilight Plushie that's so cute it makes Haku explodes. Twice.
Russianbrony: Damn you russian pony man, I lost too.
I won the game :3
No one can win the game, silleh. :3
I did
one does not simply 'win' the game
/me is not stiched together rather crudely, thus making Haku turn into the frankenstien monster
/me gives RDash5000 a plushie similar to http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/8e32387056aedcd1ceb3ab5cb28fa1a2.jpg
It's simple, you just win the game
/me hugs sonicdude558
you win or you die
ok I gotta leave for reals
cratorkid: How about both? :3
bye
i hate when i hit the switch on the power strip by accident
texasboykc09: fuck that switch
a 90 year old man who had a horrible life is dieing his last thoughts were "at least I neve lost the game" "god damnit..." and then he died

Dovah: His fault for losing
nyeh
nhey

Nope :I
Dovah: pffffft, I know far more of the workings of magic than you.
These are some nice positive lyrics

Dovah: lol
Shizuka: that the name of the song
What was that last song?

Kecleondarihu: Actually, not a bad idea. I'll do that
Hey, who here has ever played Sonic's version of mario party?
HoodyZard: You mean Sonic Shuffle?
I've seen gameplay of it, doesn't even compare to Mario Party. :D
AJIsHaunter: I think. Was the main story about Sonic in 1001 Arabian nights?
dammit
HoodyZard: Nah, that's Sonic and The Secret Rings.
I've only got 49 dollars atm
HoodyZard: No that was Sonic & The Secret Rings
I'll have to wait until I can put some money on my card
AJIsHaunter: Well, it had a side mode, and was basically like mario party
Minigames
Maps
J_G_Puff71 that game was underrated
HoodyZard: OH that, I know what you're talking about.
nyeh
What's up, doc?
gdi
hmm?
What was the last message I posted?
if theres one thing mario party teached me........... is that no matter what
no matter all your efforts
Youll always lose?
luigi will always win by doing absolutely nothing

I have $17.41 in my Steam Wallet. Putting $20 in it was a terrible mistake, as was buying that Magicka DLC when it was 75% off. So I'm swearing off any purchases AND Magicka until the 1st (or maybe 3rd) of December.
/me drinks a shot of bleach
hmm hmm
AJIsHaunter: Ty
cachikorita01 if Mario Party taught me anything, it was how to deal with the will to ragequit: STEAL ALL OF THAT SONOFABITCH'S CRAP!!!
So yeah, sonic version of mario party
13this is Brainchild - Symmetry C (Lange Breakbeat Remix)
wait, what the hell?

Canadian_Brony|AFK: mario party: breaking even the strongest of friendships since 1999
^
cachikorita01: And killing the palms of kid's hands.
:D
Mario party is responsible for over 30% of all domestic violence cases in the world
cachikorita01 Mario Party 7: how to piss off ALL your cousins.
AT THE SAME TIME
nyeh
Honestly though, my palms didn't get that hurt during the controller spinning games. :D
Nintendo just tips off the law enforcement statistic makers
lol i once played mario party with my cousins
it didnt end well
LINK IT
i havent played a single mario party match that doesnt end on someone rage quitting
cachikorita01 did you play Mario Party 7's "Deluxe Cruise" with your cousins?
^
Hey Shizuka, Audiosurf is the only music game you have, right?
I have, cachikorita01.
No video links during stream, RDash5000. :)
13Kecleondarihu: yep
Canadian_Brony: nah we played mario party 6
13well
sorry
Audiosurf is f*cking addicting
13i have The Polynomial but not as much happens
I guess you lack Beat Hazard
cachikorita01: How to win at mario party: Step 1: Unlock all the mini games. Step 2: Practice said mini games. Step 3: LAUGH AS THE WORLD BURNS AT YOUR HANDS!
i lost faith on mario party since 7
13beat hazard doesn't really interest me, i like audiosurf cause it's purely dodging
beat hazard is bad.....
imo
I liked MP7 ;~;
13yeah audiosurf has the other modes but i've never played them
cachikorita01: I hear that 9 was pretty god.
*good
i havent played 9
Shizuka: you ever give Geometry Wars a shot?
Boss battles :S
13nope
Mario Party 8 almost made me give up on the series.
HoodyZard step 4: watch as you get 1's over and over and over and over until you use the secret reset code that only you know about.
Agreed, RDash5000.

13RDash5000 gets it, AJIsHaunter missed it
OH.
Sorry. :D
The joke went WHOOSH!
hello every one
I still don't get it :S
i think it's more like 800 problems...
I don't get it at all.
/me has never played Mario Party
/me goes WHOOSH
hello every one
Shizuka: Stop making edjumakatid jokes infront of all us dumb folks
WB bigmac
13the exact line escaped me
13figured i'd go with a safely low number
Shizuka: understandable.
its 800
nyeh
700 for the MP5SD
13though when you consider the ratio of bullets to kills it must be closer to 80 :3
Hmm, I wonder if Rayman Legends will be available for PC gamers.
IMO the best Minigames were in Mario Party 6. I've held the record for fastest time in "Lab Brats" (I think that's the name) for 4 years
i must educate you my dear PillowPoni ^_^
/me considers Shizuka's logic. accepts it
pfft
logic
NocturnalBlade, with what money? And the only console I have is a PS2
what we talking about
everything makes sense when you throw logic out the window :)
Mario Party
k
bigmac several different conversations to choose from
I wish I could've played MP6. I missed it by accident.
that was a fun game
MP7 was pretty fun, though.
Mario Party 2 seemed to be the best of the Mario Partys.
Had a pretty good time with that game.
MP7's are fun...
VenHur: I find the first one to be an absolute gem as well.
J_G_Puff71 Well I tried to get the comic but they said it's no longer avaliable
I love MP3 as well.
the day-night cycle can really f*ck up your strategies (if something else didn't already) and the mini-games were the best part.
AJisHaunter: Secound best to me if it weren't for blisters...
13what's this otakonsong.mp3 i have here
I like MP1, MP2, MP3, MP4, MP5 (sort of, I'm not really sure how I should feel about it), and MP7.
...
Shizuka
play it
Shizuka: oh lord
playitplayitplayitplayit
VenHur: I never really got blisters from that as a kid.
flash player :[
yeah
....
:P
:D
6_9
Um, what?
:D
I loved Mario Party 5, what's different than the other is that the mode robot venchiles.
:D
/me dies from laughter
AJIsHaunter: when the whole "Ship otakon" thing first started
This made my night :)
/me is bored
otakon: Ah, I see.
i loved the robot battle mode
Same here, Cypresswolf. :)
lol otakon has a ship song ^_^
cachikorita01: Agreed, but it wa smore fun with friends.
SO! Who wants to see something a little on the weird side courtesy of RAWRity?
otakon shall be shipped with everyone!
*was more
"otakon will be shipped with everyone~"
lol that song
otakon: ?
So that song was totally uncalled for then?
otakon: meeee
otakon ehh, go ahead. Can't hurt too much, right?
i was not present when the otakon shipping started. how did that start?
http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc6/252200_10151398800435802_1206853965_n.jpg RAWRity linked this in skype... not NSFW just ..weird
hmm
Goddammit. I accidentally spill tea on the computer and it fucks up momentarily
otakon: oh...my
PillowPoni: that sucks
I also loved the quest show game from MP6.
*quiz
otakon so we got . . . and . . . okay, that's just . . . WTF DUDE?!?
NocturnalBlade: yeah... "Little" Big Heart.. bad pun is bad
Birthday so close! 8 more days! ;A;
otakon um... ok?
otakon: aint it though XD
I loved the cruise theme from MP7. It would've been nice if you could explore the cruise ship yourself, IMO.
PillowPoni: is it salvageable?
happy early birthday Ponies47!
Canadian_Brony: like I said, RAWRIty linked that to me as a joke
art isn't half bad
otakon: true
but giant muscle anthro is ... well out there
that picture was horrifying
why
13a cookie to the first person to name which OST this is from
Buytoast: you want horrifying?
Shizuka: DAMN YOU WOMAN! ..Darwinia
/me wants a cookie
13nope
/me throws a muffin at otakon
let me guess
Myst
13protip, i've never streamed what it's from
13nope
Buytoast: I can show you horrifying... but I'll have to pass it by the mod first
well i'm fucked
well then there goes all my hope

I seez...
/me noms on bigmac

/me pokes Haku1013
/me puts some jetchup on bigmac and takes bigger nom
PillowPoni: so you got most of it cleaned up?
what's jetchup?
PillowPoni: make sure it's dried out, try some breathe through bags of rice in the case
otakon: was about to mention the rice lol
get of me
you don't say -__-
big macs aren't all that good
i had my first one ever today and it was very dissapointing
A&W burgers are so much better
Nick's Gyros hs the best burgers
that's just a universal fact
Canadian_Brony: Eeyup. :3
so what was the point in adding the "twin brother" part...
AJIsHaunter thats my line
Otakon, it spilled on my laptops keyboard
Canadian_Brony: For teh lulz? :3
meh, good enough
and suddenly music
I don't think they make ziploc bags for 5lb laptops
CHIPTUNES!
AHOY!

I love me some chip tunes

PillowPoni: ANY rice will do, hell use dry beans if you have to that will work as well. Put the lappy in a bowel and surround it with rice and dry beans, it'll help absorb he moisture and I hope you removed any battery paks it had in it
yes
AJIsHaunter == AJIsAwesome, Yes?
Oh, Super Meat Boy
YEAH
My cousin bought one of those 162GB(-ish) iPods the other day and he was telling me about it over the phone. When I asked him why he wants so much space, he said "Because I want to jog for a fucking wekk."
THat's where this is from.
*week
I only played slender for two minutes before i wussied out
donutpop365: Yep. :D
Canadian_Brony: they make iPods with 162GB storage?

iPod Classis has an insane amount of space on it
*Classic

My laptop needs a MAJOR upgrade. :D
GottaHugEmAll Creature from the Black Lagoon?
Otakon, ima go do that now.

who was in rainbow dash for one bad apple
bigmac um... ok? Not sure if itll taste all that great
PillowPoni: as long as it didn't get INSIDE of it while it was running and one you should be fine. Also, to clean it off use an old toothbrush and a SMALL amount of rubbing alchohol while it is UNPLUGGED and without a batter in it
13i knew that was the wrong one..
I wasn't here for One Bad Apple..
that niggah fried chicken

PillowPoni: how did you do that?
slender isn't scary
dis song <3
Sliverfish: don't be... it's only a game. Right...?
Firelight :)
oh no... not the feels! :'(
hnnnnngg!
Shizuka: so its supposed open a pm then? i tried it, nothing seems to have happened, altho i dont need to ns ghost right now. sorry for the noob questions
13depends on the client
this music had some good/bad timing XD
man this is hevy
^^
we should listen to smile song remix
Shizuka: im using flash site one
13most clients use /msg but i don't use lightirc on site
13could be /query
"Slender isn't scary"
well duh
NocturnalBlade, how'd I do what?
it isn't
Yes it is
Shizuka: ah, /query seems to have worked, thanks
hmm
Sliverfish: just giggle at the ghosties, give him 20 dollars, etc etc
13other option would be to use the system tab, the one showing the motd etc
NO
13i forget if we have that on our client though
ITS MAH 20 DOLLARS
too bad
am i the only one crying:'(
"[23:07:41] <PillowPoni>" you posted a blank lol
IF HE WANTS MAH MONEY HE'LL HAVE TO PRY IT FROM MY COLD DEAD HANDS
one does not simply giggle at the slendy
13
13:3

how long have we been watching this fireplace
how did you . . .
GAH
bigmac Im crying on the inside :(
see like shizu

Haku1013: that can be arranged :3
13mine's not technically blank since irssi intercepts outbound PRIVMSG to prepend the color code
13the side effect being if i hit enter it'll send the color code anyway
Shizuka: ah k.btw any idea what the square thing is i get?
figured..
to do this

08,01hey shizu, are you using my colour script?
13eeyup
i thought so but was never sure XD
13still am :3
well thats it for Haku tonight. G'night y'all
g'night Haku1013
Bye, Haku1013. :)
nite Haku1013

/me slaps Haku1013 :I
the fireplace stram is ending
*stream
"Breaking Dawn: #1 Movie in the World"
its over 9000
13that was pretty well timed actually...
13didn't realize they were lining up
Shizuka: i brought that message up from message history, and i still get the square thing. any idea what it is?
Sliverfish: that happen to me alot
13square thing?
Shizuka: yeah before the /me
the 
it messed up the /me too
13hm
13first instinct would be encoding but that doesn't make sense
Shizuka we need to watch something
13encoding should be determined by the flash client, not the browser in that case
ive seen some others get it too, but not often
bigmac: Why not this? :3
^
my eyes are on fire
Because the fire is a spy. It's not helping.
Sorry everyone.. I'm back. Just got in the shower.
13not sure what else would cause a character to get inserted into the line
Ohshiohshiohshi
my eyes are on fire Shizuka
I'm gonna do it
13still happens after a refresh?
I'm Gonna Play Slender

Sliverfish: Don't stare at him too long!
firelight take care man
Anytime Firelight thats what we are here for ^_^ *hug*
Sliverfish: never give up, never surrender
I found a note like thirteen feet away
I took it
Then instantly, I die
AJIsHaunter water evaporates before it even touches the fire
I didn't even look at him
Sliverfish: Ded.
13connection is solid up here

:O
Sliverfish: you dun died then
Let's watch somthing that dosn't have that much sad music and somthing that would make me smile.
IshPonyPonyThePony: Deprive the fire of oxygen?
This isn't Helping that much.
AJIsHaunter how?

candy:O
Firelight: sometimes sad music can make you happy
IshPonyPonyThePony: Just take the fire... and PUSH it somewhere else!
^
^^
SayWhat I can't touch it without getting burned
IshPonyPonyThePony: Enclose the fire in a vacuum sealed area so that the fire won't have anything to keep itself going.
IshPonyPonyThePony: put it on a rocket and then shoot it out
SayWhat You just made me laugh :)
i give you props.
IshPonyPonyThePony: Well clearly this is gonna take a scientist...
Nighty night guys~
enclose the fire in nitrogen, that should help

FirelightTheMagicarp: yes
TL;DR jaymoo get yer butt in this pillow fort and cuddles all the pillows
I mean, it's not like you can just go catch 6 pokemon and spam the same move over and over again to beat everything
Hey Shizuka before I vote for either Home Alone film, just wanted to double check if they both qualify as A. Both films had mixed reviews from the critics, but were really popular with audiences. Home Alone 1 was #1 in the box office for 12 weeks, and made $477,561,243 worldwide.
Not at all
Or else wut fluffeh
Okay, i'm back :)
TL;DR

Ohai HoodyZard :2

Alright guys. Eddmario posted a number of good quality images, and then he posted one bad one, and we're just forgetting that he also posted good ones too?

Kecleondarihu: It's more about what he posted
Kecleondarihu: seems legit
Kecleondarihu: its not about good vs bad, it was an unpleasant image that shouldntve been linked
Again, he rustled alot of jimmies
And that's bad, apparently
Alright everypony, look at the little red light: http://dashie.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/rsz/mlfw2767_huge.png
it depends on how you rustle them

twilight_squirtle: Eh, the sounds remind me of metal scratching on rock, and the lyrics were meh
yeah that band has some interesting songs
HoodyKazam: lyrics? its japanese :P
62.5 for Eddmario !
im hoping "thatsthejoke"
twilight_squirtle: All singing has lyrics
Eddmario because the band who did the music has a song called "Sugar Rush"
HoodyKazam: but you dont know what theyre saying
If you haven't seen "Wrek-It Ralph", GO FUCKING SEE IT RIGHT NOW!
^
But I can still rate them on sound and fluidity
it's a really good movie

I'm not complaining about the weather.
Summer's too hot and the Sun shines on my monitors. Winter's too cold and snow, if we get any, keeps getting in my shoes. Fall's just cold and dark. Spring is somewhat adequate.
Phase4, wooooot \:3/
I don't like the hot or the cold. Wonder what jmo has to say about that
>_>
I prefer spring and winter
Dear god you people are wuss.

aat the moment-
Kammerjunk, I always wanted to see snow .-.
I got rock and pop.
thelonecubone: i go back to my previous answer, Jesus :D
Jmo: I used to literally bury myself under blankets when a storm came to the point that I was drenched insweat when my parents finally managed to pull me out
Jmo: Funny, thunderstorms I don't mind. They're awesome falling asleep to.
00,02meh, i'll use the archie mix again

Toccata by Jaga Jazzist would be amazing~~
PillowPoni|Phone: daaaaw
CacturnalBlade: Naw you crazy Blade :D

AdamThePsyduck: Where are you at?
Kammerjunk, Australia .-.
Oh. Yeah, you probably don't see a lot of snow.
Not even in the summer?
thelonecubone: then i give...i got nothin XD
Why would I see snow in summer? .-.
Hm, not sure, but can we discuss what happened on Sat. morning?
I get paranoid about thunderstorms at night durong spring/summer because that's when you hear lots of weather reports about tornadoes
CacturnalBlade: you'll soon find out :D
Sabershy, during the episode?
Phase4 its hot today
00,02one day i'll get an ssd
00,02JRP2234, i noticed

Um yea. Did we really get hacked?
Phase4: Oh s S d -lol nvm

Hello AppleBloom

AdamThePsyduck: what happened you your original name?
Rofl
I am afraid of loosing my equipment- so during thunder I unplug everything
You wish you were a man Phase :P
Air conditioner? I don't even think my radiator's working.
Never had an AC
I'm afraid of tornadoes forming dufring the summer
An airconditioner in this weather? You guys are hardcore.
I think it was last summer there werre so many tornadoes I fraked out at night
*freaked
AppleBloom, oh we were all changing our names to pokemon names earlier
I better change back to normal
so many cars were broken
Kammerjunk, same here- no scary spiders, crazy tornadoes-
only mudslides and strong winds
And everytime the lightpost near my window went out from a storm, I immediately go under covers
Oh there is someone named AppleBloom? How cute...
AdamTheDuck: ohhh
but with the lack of mountains, you guys probably don't have mudslides either <,<
dem mitts
/me slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
PillowPoni|Phone: daaaaaw that sounds adorable :3
Vivix: Uhh... We have hills, I guess?
I dunno, our hills aren't that big either.
/me has never been to denmark

I like it in scandinavia- so safe
Vivix: ...The tallest point in Denmark is 171 metres.

I saw EP4 when it aired. I thought it was kind of funny.
speaking of the hack, have we taken precautions to ensure that doesn't happen again?
00,02ohai Moopy
I saw ep4 somewhere else
It wasn't a hack for gods sake.
eeyup
Kammerjunk: We on 4 already? Ah man.
ah
It was, it was a cracked authkey on mips wasn't it?
AppleBloom: It's probably only something on mips.
AppleBloom: Oooh! What happened?
It was hijacked, not hacked.
Somepony hijack the stream or something?
in laymans terms that's the same
Vivix: Yes, annoyingly.
donutpop365: GNAA got on the stream and started linking profanity and other vulgarities, took away over half the episode from us
Ah so we did get hacked? That is kinda... disappointing? Depressing?
I think I hopped into Ustream
Vivix: and Hacker means OMG AUGH TERRORIST in layman's terms...
Peanut.
so I caught everything after theee first break
true, hehe
I thought it was kind of funny. I watched it in 720p not long after, anyway.
yeah the 1080p was fast that day too
00,02stupid buggy ramps
Phase4: Going at terminal velocity on TF2 when suddenly you stop on a surf ramp. yeah good.
I find it impressive that only 8 hours afters the upload episode four had like a quarter million views on it
Same here, but it is kinda sad whn you get up 7 in the morning to watch a nice show and others are out to ruin it.
yea~~
well i'm going to sleep, Goodnight everyone
night TheGreatAndPowerfulT
I didn't think it was funny, but then again, I don't really have a sense of humour in that regard
G'night TheGreatAndPowerfulT.
Night TheGreatAndPowerfulT! :)
16:30, kinda- perfect time
well what was humorous Vivix was the fact that the episode was against bullying, and they did just that
Hehe, that's true
See this is why we need some pony to boot GNAA offline forever and get mips tv back AppleBloom
no we just ignore GNAA
Wow, life is really ironic..
until they go away, like gluefactory
/me Silence.
Sabershy: "Why does life have to be so ironic?!"
Vivix: gluefactory..? lol irony you strike agani!
Kammerjunk: Seriously, :D
/me makes a kaboom sound
/me Explodes
00,02gluefactory?
I have no idea what just happened in this game... All I know is I like it
I 'unno.
Phase4, shooortlived hacker group about a year ago? Can't remember full name
"ANTIBRONY" something, they got bored and did other things
00,02ah
well what I can't understand is why they target bronys, it's not like they are going to stop us
Well, I'm going to go walk my dogs, and then I'm going to leave for school.
bye Kammerjunk
Target us for fun
so my friends been telling me about the next update for minecraft xbox adition when are they doing the next update again? like about a week or 2 maybe i guess or i don't know?
Bye, have fun.
hmm, guess i can drop the poke pun :D
Bajbaj have fun
there we go
Moopy: minecraft updates are never accurate as far as the 360 goes. They said that creative mode would be out in 2 weeks, 2 months later we finally got the update
Bye Kammerjunk. :)
Bye Kammerjunk
Bye Kammerjunk :P
well AppleBloom i don't want 4J studio's to take out the creative mode cause i waited so long for it to come out so yeah
Okay, key oard is cleaned inthe spaces. Didn't have to pry off any keys
AppleBloom: The mentality of bullies are hard to understand sometimes. Some hate you for a reason; maybe even a justified one. but others out there just hate you for your guts. :\
PillowPoni|Phone: yay
dat key oard inthe
Moopy: they're not going to remove it, it's just take what they say witha grain of salt. They pretty much dont know when the update will come out
Sabershy: love and tolerate?
Oh just asking though
Dat Jmo.
Dat Fluffeh.
AppleBloom: Tolerate yes. You don't have to force yourself to love them.
I'm gonna miss movie night :(. I'm gonna be skiing though! :D/:( I am conflicted.
NocturnalBlade, hopefully the keys will fucking work
PillowPoni|Phone: i think they will ^_^ i just correct you like normal though :3
And the goddamn keys still don't type.

donutpop365: Don't get me wrong. You will be missed. But you don't always get the chance to skii.

I've never opened a modern laptop, though- so I don't know if it's a good idea
Diamond Tiara is okay. I think she would be a whole better if she was good, but that defeats the purpose of having her evil. >_>

The power of Phase4 compells thee
TF2 is an fps storyless game, it doesn't need one
Oh hey, MadSurge, you're on!
Phase4 is best starer
It has one. Have you people not read the comics?
Holy shit kid, would you just shut it?
donutpop365: eeyup! :)
We don't give a shit if there is a lore, it isn't enforced.
^
Jmo You'e mean.
And you're annoying.
For Jmo, he is actually being nice.
Power to you if you read the comics, but I can go without them.
My name's not annoying silly :)
Well, Jmo's equivalent for nice :$
donutpop365, .-. Go to bread
You're right, your name would be retarded.
Mum bought 6 1 litre tubs of vanilla and caramel incecream :D
I don't have a mental deficiency?
Sorry didnt mean to do that emote
You act like it.
The tagline for the brand is "Share the delight"

/me steals one of Sliverfish's tubs of ice cream :3
As if I'm sharing this
Thank you for complementing my activ=ng :)
*Kills AdamTheDuck*

How do you do the italics?
Jmo no actually on a normal day I would be crying but i'm getting a wii U in 4.5 hours so i;m happy
Type /me before saying something my dear Sliverfish.
okay
Good for you, you're paying for an over-priced updated Wii.
You must feel so good.
Jmo Didn't you buy Cod?
yes
I buy all games, what of it?
/me licks taoumi :3
All CoDs are the same.
Jmo just don't give a fuck

You don't say.

You're hassling me about buying a new conole.
*console
Carry on carry oon
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJbrTgUL0Dk AWWW YEAH!
Like nothing really mattered :$
no youtube links when stream on silverfish
Sliverfish, please, no non-image links during a stream.
i'm not seeing a stream on my screen
Sliverfish, try refreshing then.
neither am I
now i do :P
how do you unlock all that stuff?
Sliverfish, magic >_>
and magnets <_<
There's a difference between spending $350 on a console and $40 on a game.
Jmo, $40, hmm not a bad price.
jaymoo i will get the wii u in a few years
Jmo Yes but I don
o.o
In a few years time the price will be decent enough.
Wtf
lol Impersonation.
Dat AdamTheDuclk
Dont own the console yet. You buy one CoD you've baught all
/me kicks AdamTheDuclk in the shin
Oh lord, you're one of those kids.
My brains sleep deprived my spellcheck is flawed
Biased towards CoD.
SPAI :<
well i got the 3Ds shortly after it came out cause the zelda game
was a gift :>
MOAR SPAI.
I hate CoD. They are all almost the same
Go jump on your hate bandwagon kiddo.
AdamTheDuck stop that
Multiplayer seems to be mostly the same ideas, zombies on the other changed very much.
Jmo You blame me for hating?
other hand*
haters gonna hate me ;_;
Who said I'm blaming you?
Woooooo
I wouldn't hate cod is it gave a good ammount of new stuff from the last but it just doesn't
Oh my God.

It looked venemous
i don't know if i should do a peanut butter sandwhich or not cause the last time i did that it made me sick to my stomach
Jmo: Owww.
And right as it was about to climb up my foot, one of our chickens kills it then eats it
A chicken saved my life :DD

Goodnight JRP2234|Zzz
aniderp: Wat? D:
Think you'll scrape it out in time?
08,01aye; as i say, it's only 2,000 words

Horses make everything cool. \:3/

/me wants a horsey :3c
Ride da horsie!
weee on a horise
you going to fast D:
Holding a gun like that while riding a horse is quite dangerous .-.
Playing campaign, is he?
That and horses don't like high pitched noises .-.
You train horses to get used to those kinds of noises
SuperBrony64: Get the Stinger rocket launcher out on the horse : D
11,02i liek poniez :D
SuperBrony64, eww ponies
like link has a bow and arrow?
There's this one dinner show in my area that's a horse show, and the stage has flashing lights all over the ceiling so the horses don't freak out when people take pictures.
Gold_Demona, hmm, that's interesting
I don't horses are used much in combat anymore anyway
think*
a horse hugged me before :>
wrapped her neck around my shoulder
Yeah, probably not so much. Not much tactical advantage to fighting on horseback. :P
you think epona will be in new zelda game?
brb~
ok i got an idea people
There are Zelda games that DON'T have Epona in them?
11,02Yup, Wind Waker and Skyrim
windwaker,skyward sword
1,2
11,02Skyward Sword I mean ><
I don't count WindWaker because Toon Link
skyward has the loft wing
I see
you go flying
heh
11,02All the handheld Zelda games, aside from Ocarina of Time 3D, don't have Epona.
The most recent Zelda game I played was Ocarina of Time on the N64
spirit tracks has the train
choo choo
SuperBrony64: Don't those all have Toon Link though? Or are based on previous Zelda titles?
Ah well
im gonna get a baby horsie and call her epona :>
