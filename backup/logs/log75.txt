<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM MUSIC TRIVIACEPTION: The slow, gloomy, blaring trombones in the main theme of the film score are actually based on an extremely slowed down version of the fast, high pitched trumpets in the beginning of the 칄dith Piaf song "Non, je ne regrette rien," which is used as a plot device in the film. Furthermore, when music is heard by someone who
<ActionScripter9109> POLYESTER? YOU FOAL!
<Bulletbarrage> ESPLOSION
<Silverscreen> 11who is currently within a dream, the music is perceived as slowed down. Thus, the main theme of the film score is almost exactly what the beginning of "Non, je ne regrette rien" would sound like to a dreamer. This thematic device is brought to its logical conclusion when the song plays at the end of the credits, signaling that the audience is about to

<Rainbow_Derp> a video within a video? MADDNESS

<Sumica> not best choice for a totem, farly sure all chess peices fall over when you do that.
<anotherbrony> dman?
<Lukem1999> How much longer will this movie be?
<RanYakumo> Apparently, Cillian Murphy was in Tron, too.
<Dman> yes, anotherbrony?

<Excalibur> it never ends
<sklar> NewDCD its only way they'll learn what it is right?
<anotherbrony> espa침ol?
<gryffinp> I don't get why it would never topple in a dream
<FritzTheCat> Well, totems still needed to be emphacized so it's not really wasted.
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM ELLEN PAGE TRIVIACEPTION: Jessy Schram, Taylor Swift and Carey Mulligan were considered for the role of Ariadne before Ellen Page accepted it.
<gryffinp> But whatever
<Lukem1999> Excalibur: Oh f***...
<Purple`Prose> You only use your Totem when you wake up or are in your own dream
<Hipster_Brony> 8o hai misterbristle
<NewDCD> 9sklar: pretty much
<Silverscreen> 11Taylor Swift...
<Excalibur> it ends when you take it out or turn it off
<FlamingBooger> ewww taylor swift
<Purple`Prose> Praise Nolan
<Dman> anotherbrony - de lo que yo sepa, yo, (tu,) Y newdcd hablamos espanol. Y no tengo la 'enie' tengo un teclado ingles
<Silverscreen> 11just...why?
<UncleOrange> You need like 3 reclaimeds if you want a good totem
<Scorchman> Taylor Swift? whaaa.....
<Apple_Bloom> Sorry Taylor Swift
<Riders> Thank god for the final result
<FritzTheCat> Ellen Page is so intelligent yet quirky.
<RanYakumo> FlamingBooger I actually kind of like her.
<Lukem1999> I'm guessing another 30-45 minutes?
<Apple_Bloom> But Pinkie Pie is the cutest pony of all time
<Apple_Bloom> OF ALL TIME
<Selmont> no
<Broseph> I'm okay with this.
<The_Si_BadGui> The amount of memetic jokes that we'd be making if Swift got the part...
<Stabbercube> OF ALL TIME
<techdude300> damn shes smart
<anotherbrony> esta bien, suele ser un problema el no tener la 침
<Dman> WHAT ARE DREAMS? baby don't wake me. don't wake me. DEEPER.
<Scorchman> Taylor Swift can play a theme song for them in the dream!
<mib_yjsduh> i bet it's getting worse
<DrWhooves> my totem would be a figurine of fluttershy
<RanYakumo> Apple_Bloom Not Fluttershy? D:
<UncleOrange> But Lyra is best pony
<FritzTheCat> Kanye West is cuter
<Tyranico> I am happy this movie turned out the way it did. nuff said
<mib_jwtmpw> Ellen page is the best person ever
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM TOTEM TRIVIACEPTION: Mal's totem, a spinning top, is (probably) a reference to the Clifford D. Simak's story 'Ring Around the Sun' where the spinning top is used as a way to skip from one parallel Earth to another (by way of helping characters to concentrate).
<Hipster_Brony> 8Apple_Bloom: nope, RD is
<RDash> No one said it wasnt getting worse
<InsertKeksy> Lyra is best pony for sure
<Dman> DID YOU KILL HER?
<anotherbrony> Dman- no me anda el sonido de la pelicula

<Jon> Silver isn't that some spoilers?
<mib_jwtmpw> Ellen is best pony
<Apple_Bloom> Apple Bloom is the best
<Stabbercube> Little dick
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol silver, you mean cobb?
<Combustiblelemons> RD wouldn't be my totem. Definitely not...
<Purple`Prose> This is like Ocean's Eleven meets Nightmare on Elm Street 3
<Apple_Bloom> Apple Bloom is the best Pony
<UncleOrange> Imma let you finish, but Fluttershy is the cutest pony of all time!
<Silverscreen> 11Hipster: Nope. The top was Mal's totem first.
<Xiagu> How could RD be your totem
<TGPFluttershy> Fluttershy would definitely be my totem.
<mib_jwtmpw> she is XD
<The_Si_BadGui> ...Inception gives you Little Richard?
<GGgala> spoiler?
<The_Si_BadGui> ...!
<FritzTheCat> Little Richard cured himself of his bisexuality.

<TGPFluttershy> UncleOrange, you are the Kanye West of bronies, and I like you for that.

<RobotPinkie> So if I'm getting this correctly, limbo contains a slightly pink hat?
<Broseph> In a video game, you level up. In Inception, you go levels down.
<Purple`Prose> That's a good comparison
<Excalibur> gentlemen
<Mox> ues lukem

<FritzTheCat> Luna's destiny was a floating rock.
<Mordekaizer> AN OWA???
<Tyranico> A Gala within a Gala
<Lukem1999> Who did?
<Silverscreen> 11Quick question: why go into Fischer's mind for the first level?
<Zyblorg> Peanut Crunch here. It wouldn't let me log in with that name for some reason.
<RanYakumo> Broseph You can level down in Final Fantasy II.
<Tyranico> Galaception

<Apple_Bloom> All you have to do is talk
<GGgala> Monkey_Zombie: install adblock extension?
<Dman> Silverscreen - all I can think of : /

<Apple_Bloom> Funfact: Han Zimmer did music for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2
<Hipster_Brony> 8Marceline was a notorious parasprite on Ponychan
<Purple`Prose> Suddenly, GRAVITY SHIFT
<mib_rol25u> oh snap
<RanYakumo> dat roll
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM PLOTHOLE: The flipping of the van should have worked as a kick to Arthur from the suddeny falling.
<Broseph> Alright gravity, prepare your anus!!!
<FwriedWrice> rick roll
<RainBroDash> o i c
<GGgala> this is some 2001: A Space Odyssey shit right here

<Tyranico> This is the best fight scene ever filmed, other than the Matrix one

<ASFLEADER> MINEFUCKING FUCK
<The_Si_BadGui> Kung Fu Treachery.
<CrimsonRisk> HOLY CRAP IT'S FLUTTERPEANUT
<Riders> Joseph Gordon Levitt should have been the new Spider-Man
<mib_q1npi6> lol
<Jon> Silver maybe the sedatives subdued the kick so that it would have to be longer or more major?
<Stabbercube> SO much fuck
<Stabbercube> My brain
<Zyblorg> To get the upper hand on your opponent, this is where you say "Hey look! An Ursa Major!"
<CrimsonRisk> I FEEL LIKE I'M SEEING A CELEBRITY
<Intangible> SilverScreen: That is actually pretty cool
<Dermathil> O_O FLUTTERPEANUT HI

<Flutterpeanut> 13I'm a regular user that's just allowed to use colored text.
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM NOLAN TRIVIACEPTION: According to Cinematographer Wally Pfister, Warner Brothers executives approached Christopher Nolan about making the film in 3D, but he refused the idea, claiming "it will distract the storytelling experience of Inception". (Dman's comment: It's official, he's awesome.)
<Denied_Existence> ITS JAMES BOND TIME
*timmymonsta 0is confused
<Flutterpeanut> 13=D

<ASFLEADER> holy fuck, thats some military
<Dashite_Alt> Ghosties, you hear that? Flutterpeanut isn't a mod! Kick him!
<mib_q1npi6> why he playing spec ops without a partner :(
*GGgala can't believe that worked
<Dave_BroZilla> You guys ever notice how the 8 on a digital clock is slightly bigger in the bottom?
<Zyblorg> Seriously, don't the cut columns in the Luke/Vader battle in ESB look a bit like cigarettes?
<UncleOrange> Did he died?
<LuridChronomancer> Why didnt they choose something armored?
<mib_782n2z> dream a fucking bazooka
<DragonRage> Hah. Nolan is pretty awesome if he told Warner Brothers to take their 3D and shove it.
<ThatIsNotHowYouCallAChicken> He's listening to Trollolololo
<RanYakumo> THEY'RE NOT READY.
<TGPFluttershy> Christopher Nolan: Please never make a movie in 3D.
<Flutterpeanut> 13But I don't want to be kicked!
<Tyranico> Yay for Chris Nolan Again! I really don't care for 3D at all
<Combustiblelemons> he's waking up
<WF_Chronicles> 0OH SHIT, THE MUSIC.
<RobotPinkie> I always look at bigger bottoms
<Combustiblelemons> :o
<Dman> Aww, thanks Silverscreen! =]
<Apple_Bloom> 3D is for Dummies
<Dave_BroZilla> So, has their been enough BWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH yet?
<Xiagu> the music is 12 times slower! ...or was it 20..?
<Purple`Prose> Uh oh. Incoming Kick...
<Broseph> REVEALED IN THE FIRST EXPANSION PACK OF BATTLEFIELD 3...
<dubtrotmaster> lol?
<dubtrotmaster> aaawwww wut?
<Rainbow_Derp> wait maybe this server is a dream
<SirReginaldPonyworthIII> They weren't expecting resistance, which is why they arent in an armored van or a tank.
<RanYakumo> TgPFluttershy: Well, the Dark Knight Rises isn't going to be in 3D, so it's looking like your wish has been granted so far.
<FlamingBooger> TOO SOON... THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID
<Apple_Bloom> Oh look spraypainted airsoft guns
<Lukem1999> 20 percent slower? LOL
<Dman> Ten. Seconds. Flat. from the jump
<Broseph> ...WILL BE THE 3 LEVELS OF INCEPTION!!!
<Zyblorg> Sundance theaters actually have the best glasses, though, if you're going to take the dive.
<Silverscreen> 11And I agree. It took some balls to tell a big studio company "up yours." Then again, he is their most recent cash cow, so he did have the leverage.
<Tyranico> RanYakumo: yay :D
<RanYakumo> WHY IS THAT RUSSIAN USING AN AMERICAN GUN. D:<
<Ghosties> who did you think it was, Hipster?
<Sumica> lets go deeper so we have more time.
<FwriedWrice> Holla holla get $
<TGPFluttershy> I know. I want him to keep doing it this way, RanYakumo
<Dashite_Alt> JAMES BOND!
<DragonRage> ... I see what you did there.
<mib_782n2z> leverage?
*Dman wonders what a TOOT would sound like, if it were played in the real world, in Layers 1, 2, and 3.

<Dman> Dat theme
<Purple`Prose> Dman: Each layer would slow the toot down
<WF_Chronicles> 0he did great
<Ghosties> You think it's the same Marceline from Ponychan?

<Dman> purple`prose

<Hipster_Brony> 8it could be
<Xiagu> This part is retarded
<The_Si_BadGui> Toooooooooooooooot.
<RobotPinkie> A toot of a trumpet would sound roughly like BBBRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAHHHH three levels deep.
<UncleOrange> LETS FINISH OUR HOLIDAY CHEER
<Craft4D> i called all this shit way before this movie came out
<GGgala> the music playing is still the same key/tone at all levels, but it's intermittent?
<featherwing> tuba.
<Hipster_Brony> 8thats why i was saying to keep an eye on him
<Dman> robotpinkie hahaha!
<RanYakumo> Also, I personally loathe 3D movies for the record.

<Ghosties> 4Before they hit the water
<GGgala> delicious freefall
<mib_q1npi6> 10 minutes
<techdude300> This movie is amazing
<mib_782n2z> no gravity?
<Broonsbane> MAGIC
<RanYakumo> My response is to make fun of it.
<mib_yjsduh> like 40 minutes
<Dashite_Alt> Ghosties, not long enough
<Dman> ghosties - 10 seconds so ....
<Zyblorg> What are you doing, Dave?
<Colt_Phelps> Enough time to finish the movie.
<Scorchman> 10 sec
<SirReginaldPonyworthIII> Like, 6 seconds
<Aponymous> How do I without gravity?
<Dman> about 20 mins

<NewDCD> 9there's something I never understood, though
<ThatIsNotHowYouCallAChicken> I'd say less than 4 seconds in real time
<RobotPinkie> Well, if it takes 4 seconds for the van to hit the water, they have about 30 minutes
<NightFurson> HOW DO I SHOT GRAVITY
<Sumica> It stays put for the fight but now it all floats.
<Dman> ghosties - 3 mins in level 2, 20 mins in level 3
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM ARIADNE'S HAIR TRIVIACEPTION: Ariadne's hair is in a tight bun in the hotel sequence so that the filmmakers didn't have to figure out how her hair should move in zero-gravity.
<Broseph> Ghosties Eh, there are some time ratios they use, but idk them.
<LuridChronomancer> This is the dream.

<techdude300> It's human Jenga!
<Tigerflame> smart!
<Wolf_Dash> Friendly spy plane inbound.
<Ghosties> If considering the every day laws of physics and the stream of time for the conscious mind and subconscious mind...wouldn't that mean that technically, right now, all of us are in a dream?
<Combustiblelemons> what if the dreamer dreams of abstract dreams?
<Scorchman> lmao human jenga. xD
<Intangible> It's odd how they only bring up the projection not mind killing thing this late in the movie
<Dman> inb4 SHE'S NOT REAL

<featherwing> that would be so terrible.
<NewDCD> 9yeah, because Cobb has been in Limbo
<ThatIsNotHowYouCallAChicken> ALL MY BITS
<Tyranico> Ideas are really contagious
<Dashite_Alt> Apple_Bloom They're stormtroopers
<mib_782n2z> moxL: i read cupcakes
<Lukem1999> Who wrote Rocket to insanity?
<techdude300> a couple within a couple
<Wolf_Dash> 13ish.
<MirrorImage> Sumica: make sure you don't read it before bedtime
<Flutterpeanut> 13ORLY
<sotha> Don't read it Sumica! It's a trap.
<RanYakumo> Someone played Minecraft too long.
<Wolf_Dash> 13YARLY
<Zyblorg> Tjeu
<Apple_Bloom> That explains it
<Flutterpeanut> 13You shouldn't be using colors.
<Purple`Prose> Welcome to Cobb's Minecraft server
<Jon> Maybe we'll see wall-e
<Ghosties> So, why is it decaying?
<DSNesmith1> lolwolfdash
<Rainbow_Derp> limonception
*Silverscreen 11only has dreams when he sleeps lightly.
<Ghosties> Falling apart?
<timmymonsta> 0you just found a kick
<Jon> with steve
<Dman> autokick sure is autokick
<Flutterpeanut> 13xD
<UncleOrange> Okay, I;m being reminded too much of minecraft
<NewDCD> 9yeah, Limbo is blank unless someone you are sharing the dream with has already been there
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> BOT
<RobotPinkie> Damn, just one more level deeper and they'd have reached Equestria.
<mib_782n2z> banhammer
<Zyblorg> They're in Lybia!
<GGgala> dari-bot is on top of shit
<ASFLEADER> writers in this film should get fucking medals for this@
*Silverscreen 11had a dream of defending Equestria against giant Lizard Men this morning.
<DragonRage> Likewise, Silverscreen.
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> GGgala bth
<Combustiblelemons> same silverscreen
<WF_Chronicles> 0Level 5
<mib_q1npi6> Equestria = Lvl 5?
<Sumica> but i have morbid curisody.
<WF_Chronicles> 0Equestria
<timmymonsta> 0well silver
<DSNesmith1> Limbo, level n+1
<DragonRage> The part about dreaming lightly, I mean.
<Hipster_Brony> 8Silverscreen: wat
<DrunkShark> so
<NewDCD> 9since Cobb has been there, this Limbo is a projection of Cobb's
<RanYakumo> RobotPinkie Real question is, what comes after Equestria?
<mib_782n2z> simple physics
<Lucid> -just came in- whats playin folks?
<Combustiblelemons> I like to be fully in control of my dreams
<timmymonsta> 0thats quite interesting
<Tigerflame> smart!
<DSNesmith1> n=constructed dreamspaces
<DrunkShark> for the scenes in the hotel
<TheQuestionMark> level 4.5
*Silverscreen 11had a dream of defending Equestria against giant Lizard Men this morning.
<Rainbow_Derp> when i close my eyes i somtimes see blocks
<DragonRage> Not the part about giant lizardmen invading Equestria.
<DrunkShark> are we looking into the future?
<Zyblorg> Equestria! FRIENDSHIP!
<Silverscreen> 11It was very odd.
<RobotPinkie> Nothing comes after Equestria!
<GabeMoist> @Silverscreen I like that dream
<Intangible> I have no dreams, due mainly to having no soul
*DSNesmith1 is envious of silverscreen
<Dman> silverscreen - 09____________________-0
<BranRay> DEFEAT THE ARMY OF MANTIS MEN
<UncleOrange> Why did the tension get released if there was no gravity?
<Tyranico> I'm jelly Silverscreen
<MirrorImage> RanYakumo: The moon
<GabeMoist> You should write a fic
<RobotPinkie> It's the final stage of consciousness
<partysmores> what what we playing
<partysmores> what's on
<sotha> I nkow what comes after Equestria. The moon.
<Zyblorg> Well then how come Twilight has a dream?
<DSNesmith1> my pony dreams usually consist of pinkie throwing me a party for something
<Hipster_Brony> 8because cobb hasn't been there in centuries of limbo time
<The_Si_BadGui> Dream preview of Season 2.
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> what kind of TROLL PHYSICS CAN we come up from this movie
<CircuitMane> anypony else find an odd sense of irony that we're all lovers of a show with super colorful equines and yet when we try to have color here in a chat for a get together of said fans we get banned?
*ThatIsNotHowYouCallAChicken thinks that Silverscreen's dreams are sexy.
<partysmores> is this Inceptionor that Tomatoes movie?
<Dashite_Alt> Silverscreen: 6_9
<mib_782n2z> what a piece of crap
<UncleOrange> HE IS DESCRIBING MINECRAFT
*timmymonsta 0had a dream of silver having a dream of defending equestria from giant lizard men this morning
<techdude300> Can they shape limbo since there aren't prjections
<RanYakumo> MirrorImage AFter the moon comes Mars.
<Ghosties> Ohhh, so that's why it's falling apart. No one's been there to take care of it
<DragonRage> Is that lizardmen as in humanoid lizards, or lizardmen as in Lizardman from Soul Calibur?
<Purple`Prose> This is Inception
<GGgala> not terribly, CircuitMane
<Dman> techdude3000 yup
<NewDCD> 9pretty much
<Zyblorg> OMG! The Quill and Sofa Shop! What have they done to it?!
<DragonRage> Because an army of the latter would be pretty cool.
<RanYakumo> CQC
<Needsmorepony> one time i had a dream i was playing world of warcraft and then we came to a boss and the only way to beat him was to have sex
<DSNesmith1> screw the real world
*Bjornfot used to dream within his dreams all the time when he was little
<Dashite_Alt> COMMANDO
<UncleOrange> Double kill!
<mib_q1npi6> Somewhere in limbo, there is a giant statue of Derpy
<Silverscreen> 11The only thing I really remember is me Rarity, and Rainbow Dash being attacked by a bunch of these lizard creatures.
<mib_yjsduh> he is such a good shot
<LuridChronomancer> Dem stormtroopers.
<NewDCD> 9bloody good movie eh? That's why my expectation of Rises are good
<Apple_Bloom> I call hax
<Selmont> +50
<Broseph> Killtastic!!!
<Stabbercube> I fucking never remember my dreams
<RobotPinkie> "Unfortunately Notch hadn't implemented the building materials we needed, but we made do with what we had"
<sotha> You see, when Celestia banned Luna, she really just sent her sister deeper.
<Ghosties> It's certainly entertaining
<CircuitMane> gggala: Oh okay, maybe it's my crazy pony mind
<DSNesmith1> silverscren: I never get rarity in mine D:
*GGgala woke up from a dream within a dream. Realized he was trapped in the level 1, panicked
<TheQuestionMark> somewhere
<Broonsbane> they need more c4
<SirReginaldPonyworthIII> lol
<Dman> lol sotha
<Colt_Phelps> I had this dream that I was attacking Equestria with an army of giant lizard men this morning.
<Silverscreen> 11I was kicking ass until one of them grabbed me.
<NewDCD> 9the only pony-related dreams I've had are pony-merchandise-related
<Nikola> I had a dream once where I flew with rainbow dash, then got friendly air tackled by her
<Supaspeedstrut> i only remember the incredibly epic images
<Dashite_Alt> Saito is old school. He doesn't have regenerating health
<Ghosties> I don't know if Attack of the Killer Tomatoes will be a good way to end this BMN
<Nikola> It was nice.
<Broseph> sotha IT MAKES SENSE
<Combustiblelemons> C4 up in this bitch.
<UncleOrange> DO IT WITH MAGIC
<RanYakumo> Stabbercube I distinctly remember my best dreams. Such as when I invaded Venezuela and won in time for my cousin and some internet guy to get married.
<TGPFluttershy> I've had pony dreams before
<DSNesmith1> so the lesson of Inception is: If you're not sure whether or not you're dreaming, shoot yourself in the head
<Tyranico> Pony merch NewDCD?
*Hipster_Brony 8had a dream once where he was defending Equestria from 4chan trolls
<TGPFluttershy> With self-inserts
<The_Si_BadGui> I had a Derpy dream.
<Ghosties> I just can't see it ending this BMN better than this
<Zyblorg> Samus just took her clothes off.
<mib_q1npi6> Did you die?
<DSNesmith1> inb4 last-minute exposition
<DeadlyPony> That's what I did :D
<RobotPinkie> I've started dreaming of ponies every other night.... is something wrong with me?
<NewDCD> 9It was bloody crazy
<MirrorImage> sure it was a dream hipster?
<Sathi> We still did not pass the magic 200 :(
<Apple_Bloom> Look knife fight
<DragonRage> That's Wario, Snake.
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> so if you dreamed of ponies your MIND SECURITY would be the EQUESTRIAN GUARD?
<Silverscreen> 11Hipster_Brony: was that Equestria or Ponychan? :P
<Rainbow_Derp> the horror!!!!
<TheQuestionMark> something you should know about inception- they really only use heroin
<Tyranico> Hipster_Brony: Pics or it didn't happen
<Intangible> what is dream, what is reality? Is that the question that many people shall ask themselves tonight?
*Dman has not once had a Pony dream yet, and still remembers one or two dreams very well every morning. mind Y U NO
<Hipster_Brony> 8it was equestria
<UncleOrange> I had a dream where Twilight was supplying a castle seige
<Broseph> KILLIMANJARO!!! I'M BATMAN!!!
<YusukeKomiya> My best dream was defending Japan from North Koreans and CHinese
<mib_782n2z> DSNesmith1: lol
<desertman2> shoot her!
<CircuitMane> hipster_brony: Please tell me you had a grenade launcher or something that went boom
<WF_Chronicles> 0man
<RanYakumo> You're late for dinner Cobbs.
<Rainbow_Derp> the horror!!!!
<DSNesmith1> has anyone else ever noticed that Cobb says "There's only one thing you need to know about me" like, five times in this movie?
<Purple`Prose> Hi Mal...
<GabeMoist> I never dream
<ThatIsNotHowYouCallAChicken> i had a dream that i was vigorously masturbating then when i woke up i was vigorously masturbating
<Colt_Phelps> I found that I have nightmares consistently if I fall asleep to classical music.

<Rainbow_Derp> lol
<mib_q1npi6> brb I have to clean up
<FreezeFrame> I'd love to, but I don't have the digital box in my room, so I don't always have it. Since Hub is digital-only and TW requires that you lease digital decoding equipment from them.
<DSNesmith1> @Ghosties: Yeah, their fictional reality is actually better than reality
<mib_yjsduh> INERTIA
<NewDCD> ....I jelly
<Hipstertwilight> 6inb4 ending complaints

<NewDCD> but Sathi, it's really late for you no?
<ASFLEADER> hipster_brony wat
<mib_782n2z> i lied
<mib_782n2z> hahahahaha
<DSNesmith1> they actually repair his relationship with his father even though the man was a dick
<GGgala> actually, BOTH of them still are?
<Ghosties> 4So was this all an elaborate plot to get him to have a positive memory of his father?
<Sathi> yes it is
<mib_q1npi6> yes
<Ghosties> 4What's the payoff?
<NewDCD> you should probably stream Euroshows instead
<DSNesmith1> yes
<Jon> Yes.
<Umbranox> inertia is a property of matter
<techdude300> yep
<FlamingBooger> sweet mother of fuck i just epic-gasm'd

<GGgala> Ariadne should've got a headshot
<FritzTheCat> More Beer? WHAT FOR?!
<Hipster_Brony> 8ghosties: you'll see
<sklar> Ghosties nothing is true, everything is permitted
<mib_q1npi6> so they can plant an idea into his brain
<GamerGodJones> IlOvEmYsHiFtBuTtOn
<RanYakumo> DSNessmith1 See, we don't really know all that much about what the guy actually felt about his son.
<DSNesmith1> to make him break up his father's company
<nah> @ghosties the son disbands his father's company.
<Lukem1999> So for realz, how much longer is this movie?
<Dman> ghosties - the positive memory was the plot - to get him to break up his company
<Purple`Prose> Fischer would split up the energy conglomerate
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> LEVERAGE
<mib_q1npi6> to ruin the company
<CircuitMane> Ghosties: They get popcorn
<Dashite_Alt> Ghosties: They get him to break up his father's company
<Rainbow_Derp> hipster_brony youare the best
<Broseph> Ghosties Kinda, but not exactly.
<NewDCD> I'll get to training you to stream on monday
<TGPFluttershy> Hold on Ghosties
<DSNesmith1> this was all laid out way back at the start
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> THATS WHAT THEY GET
<Scorchman> they get to be in the movie
<mib_yjsduh> REMEMBER COBOL
<techdude300> so that hes convinced his father wants him to break up the company and not be like him
<Jon> We're at the ending bit.
<TheQuestionMark> was it worth it? nope it was cool though
<Dman> ghosties - so the other guy can become rich
<Rainbowfox> Yep. Popcorn
<Jon> Just a little more.
<Colt_Phelps> Remember the deal they made with Saito at the beginning?
<mib_yjsduh> THEY STILL MAD
<Denied_Existence> Ghosties THIS RIDE AINT OVER YET
<Sathi> great, looking forward to it
<Lukem1999> Were at the end?
<Reaver21> OH NOEZ SINKING VAN
<Sumica> MEOW!
<mib_q1npi6> THIS WAS A BAD IDEA
<DSNesmith1> watch this guys
<lossthief> scenes like THIS is why Nolan should have been nominated for best director
<Silverscreen> 11Ghosties: The payoff is that Fischer will liquidate his father's company and rebuild it for himself, preventing the company from becoming an international superpower.
<mib_782n2z> alost\
<FritzTheCat> DAMN YOU COBOL INDUSTRIES!!
<Ghosties> 4No, because I wasn't really around for the beginning

<Thetrollside> 10* 1*
<TheQuestionMark> oxoGEN
<Ghosties> 4Does this all mean that FISCHER'S COMPANY DOESN'T BECOME SUPER BAD BOSS OF THE WORLD or some shit?
<RanYakumo> lossthief He'll probably get nominated for The Dark Knight Returns.
<Dashite_Alt> Ghosties, yeah
<Purple`Prose> Yup
<mib_q1npi6> YES GHOSTIES
<Colt_Phelps> What Silverscreen said. Also Saito agreed to pull some strings so that Cobb can see his kids again.
<RanYakumo> Ghosties Keep on listening.
<Ghosties> 4....Wow
<RanYakumo> But pretty much yes.
<Ghosties> 4Eh
<sklar> NewDCD do you play AC
<Stabbercube> U no need to breathe?
<Dman> Ghosties - fischer's company was rival to another. ANOTHER will now becume super baws
<Ghosties> 4Okay film
<Purple`Prose> And they all get paid
<Hipstertwilight> 0the neding will be confusing
<Silverscreen> 11Ghosties: Yes, and that means that Saito's company gets to stay in business as well.
<Combustiblelemons> Y U NO SAVE LEO?
<Reaver21> Just keep swimmin', just keep swimmin'..
<Hipstertwilight> 0ending*
<techdude300> it worked
<LuridChronomancer> This is layer 1.
<Sumica> One might say the bass was kicking in this movie.
<NewDCD> 9sklar: AssaCreed? Or Armored Core?
<GGgala> it's not really about Fischer? He's a living MacGuffun
<FritzTheCat> So Cobol industries is no longer a superpower and Saito wins.
<Lukem1999> Y U NO GIVE ME OXYGEN?
<mib_q1npi6> ARMORED COAR
<FlamingBooger> ASSBRO
<sklar> ASScreed

<lossthief> ranyakumo I doubt it, he's made great movie after great movie, and hasn't been nominated. he ticked off somebody at the academy
<Ghosties> 4Is there gonna be a sequel?
<Purple`Prose> Cobb's still in Level 4
<Purple`Prose> Annnd we come full circle.
<GGgala> god i hope not
<Dman> ghosties - none planned or wanted. they want this to be original on its own
<Lukem1999> Ghosties: I don't think so
<Mox> theres supposed to be a video game not based on the actual events of this movie though
<LuridChronomancer> Cobb is in Limbo now.
<Apple_Bloom> How shit son
<NewDCD> 9MOVIECEPTION
<Silverscreen> 11And we return to the beginning.
<Reaver21> So much pixelation!

<mib_yjsduh> BEGINNING OF MOVIE
<RobotPinkie> Level 4? Shit, he's only half way through the game.
<SirReginaldPonyworthIII> Cobol isn't Fischer's company is it?
<Jon> those restarts were the movie
<FlamingBooger> there better not be a sequel
<FlamingBooger> EVER
<sklar> NewDCD yes or do you play assassiaans creed
<mib_yjsduh> QUICK
<FritzTheCat> I sequel would only "piss off certain people"
<BobJoeBillBo> Yo Cobb, we heard you like dreaming, so we put a dream in your dream in your dream so that you can dream while you dream while you dream. Cobb: We need to go deeper. Yo Dawg Guy: BITCH PLEASE!
<GamerGodJones> ARE WE WATCHING THE MOVIE AGAIN?
<mib_yjsduh> LOOP THE MOVIE
<Jon> we were going to the end not starting over
<Riders> Ghosties = Probably not. The story is complete
<Broseph> ASS'S CREED!!!!
<mib_rol25u> So this is level 0?
<Reaver21> Who's the old geezer?
<mib_q1npi6> Spoiler : Cobb takes a warp star back to level 1
<RanYakumo> And then Saito was old.
<FritzTheCat> The whole movie was a flashback?!!
<WF_Chronicles> 0so yeah
<WF_Chronicles> 0it was
<Stabbercube> JUst watch it
<sklar> Broseph yahtzee
<GamerGodJones> FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<Dashite_Alt> Old man is explained in 3...
<DSNesmith1> levels explanation: cobb bleeds out in limbo, rises up to level one because levels 2 and 3 have ceased to exist, then drowns int he van and gets sent down to limbo. THis creates the huge age difference between him and Saito at the end. They shoot each other, rising back up past the now-non-existant first level into reality (the plane), and the ending ensues.
<Reaver21> I believe the whole movie is a dream~
<Dashite_Alt> 2...

*Denied_Existence says to the audience, "So, now you must decide for yourself. Is this a dream, is this real life? But the real question is, Was it ever real to start? This is the question that defines the world...you decide."
<TGPFluttershy> G E N I U S!
<ASFLEADER> IT DOESNT STOP
<Purple`Prose> According to Michael Caine, any scene he's in is the Real World. I tend to accept that interpretation. Also, you can hear and see the totem wobbling.

<NewDCD> 9Okay guys, according to Alfred, in the original cut, it fell. BUT, they decided it'd be more fun to leave it open to interpretation. Canonically, it DID fall though.
