06my ankle decides TODAY it'll be sore
02o3o
02wow
06the day I had a horribly buy day at work
06now it's about dead -_-
12D:
I just realised something
12my ankle was sore 2 days ago o3o
12well, now 3 **looks at clock*
what's that
that I ate your brainses ?
12-*
o_O
06my ankle is permanently messed up, so every now and then it hurts like hevk
thief
06heck
o,o
*o.o
06imagine the feeling that it needs to be popped, like cracking your back
:3
06but it hurts whenever you put pressure on it
12O.O
12owwww ._.
06and then if you try popping it, which I've discovered it wont do, that just hurts even more
Oh, hehe
I was doing math
Sorry to leave you all hanging
/me thinks
I was only alive for 1/723684210 of the existance of the universe
02Have you tried putting heat on it?
/me considers
06yeah
06I've tried everything
06it's been 5 years
o.o
:P
xD
lol
LOL
5 years of that?
Only 1 billionth of 1% of the water on the earth is drinkable, according to Purita or w/e makes those drink filters

eww :X
XD
12Roara
065 years of off and on irritation
12have the doctors told you what's wrong with it?
06like I said, some days it's fine
12(if you have seem them that is)
06LL, I went in for Xrays, they said there's nothing wrong
06I think it healed wrong, though
12O.O
12thats horrible D:
...whats a FAT32 error?
/me huggles Roara
06considering the fall I took was kinda crazy
/me assumes that if pressure, heat, cold, or popping isn't working then...
10... somehow, I misread "Xrays" as "Xanxus"
10._____.
iirc it's a memory format thing
probably wrong though
12o3o
your file system
02I'm guessing that your bone might be rubbing up against another bone
02Or your cartilage between the bones might be starting to fade away
/me squeaks
12Laa?
02Which can also happen from healing wrong
12oh, hai~ :o
06dunno...from what I've heard about bone-on-bone, that hurts in a different way than this
Okay, I made a ron of popups at school saying that because this guy told me to
/me huggles
02Irritation might be inflamation
06that's supposed to be like a sharp pain, mine's kinda dull
10o3o brb~
On startup approx 32 of those came up
10gotta go clean the tub
02In that case, your bone might be rubbing up against some tissue and causing inflamation
:3
/me huggles back
06possibly
Not real, of course
14:3
I forkbombed a school computer once
06it's funny though
Good night everyone
06my best friend and I have the same problem on opposite ankles
I was bored and unplugged it fast >.>
That girl in the Baby video was pretty hot though
what were you doing?
out of context
10was it... uh...
that sounds creepy
02Sprain huh?
06walking to class lol
02Well
10*blanking*
06Key, yeh
looooool
10O: wow
10anyway, brb
06the two of us have bizarre similarities
10XD
02Ah
10haha, I've noticed
02You might've pulled a muscle
02And it doesn't really heal, so now and then it will come back and hurt
xD
12stairs ><
LOL
lol
Her name is Jasmine Villegas
I love this plave
times like these, glad I only have an attic over my head
/me twisted its ankle on stairs and nearly caused a domino effect as a result ._.;;;
14So liek what is everyone up to
/me has only been tripped by the street
06dunno....muscle being pulled, it's been like this for 5 years
06that doesn't add up
02My dad had the same thing happened
02It's been about 15 or more years, but it still hurts him now and then
12trying to ignore the pretzel calling from the kitchen...
14xD
02Muscles/tendons pulled/ripped
06I can understand the tendon having problems
06that's what I've thought it was
02Because it's in your leg, it won't heal properly because you most likely use your leg every day
02So it basically becomes pulled again
so it can't heal fully since its in use
and done with Pride
02Right
ghslfhslfhslabdkla I screwed up the neck
o3o
02wb
thanks
12that pretzel....
i was here, just idle though XD
/me shouts into the kitchen "STOP TORMENTING MEEEEE!"

heh
02Hmm...what to do..
06wow
06I literally failed that quiz
0640% o-o;
/me uses Hypnosis on Shiny "You sleep. That's what you do" o3o
/me hides
06the sad part is, I might have one of the highest grades in the class by default, as a lot of people will have incomplete assignments
06-_-
12o.o
02Why in the world is my computer copying whatever I highlight?
12that reminds me of what one of my friends said...
12@Roara
12she said how in her physics class
12she was failing with a 50 average
02I'm an A/B student with a D average
12and that she was one of the top students in that class ._.
my grade usually depends on the class
10and that works how?
10@Shiny
If its like "career investigation" I will fail it now
10yes?
10...
purposely for all reason
06some classes are so ridiculous that a 50% is an A
2oh o-o
02Actually no lol
06well, not technically
2and bbl o3o
02I can get A's and B's if I put my mind ot it and did my work
06what I mean by an "A" is that a 50% is the highest of the class
07o3o
06...
06ARGH
06hang on
02But I never have inspiration to do my work, so the only A's and B's I get are on my test
12o3o
02s
06and so I was talking about LL's friend in physics
12lolz
12ohhh
02Oh I see lol
06>_<
06anyways Kyu
12I was wondering why you were saying that o3o
12<late-ish>
/me puts LL in physics?
06your plush makes me want to punt kittens
07o3o

06D=
I can't play portal on my comp because intel graph. accelerator isn't recommended or known by steam or w/e, I mean it's great for Diablo/DiabloII, but gaming on a netbook is kinda impossible/really difficult, but it was free so :D
O.O
no spyro action it would seem XD
back tot he forum
meh, rude guy
/me mews~
really must not watch that Don bluth movie
02I watched a Don Bluth movie last night lol
Was it a BAD one?
02Depends on how you view Thumbelina o3o
06loool
/me pulls out Land Before Time
oh that one
06land before time <3
06I used to LOVE that series
06then it got....stupid
Thumbelina was like the Little Mermaid for him
06either that, or got smart
Aurora: I actually have all the movies XD
06same here LOL
02Yes yes it did @Roara
1-13
06oh
06wait
0613?
02And that's ironic that you say that Brother
06._.
wait...are there 14?
06....
06I only hve 10 LOL
XD
06wait
02Because Thumbelina's voice was voiced by Jodi Benson, the voice of Ariel in The Little Mermaid
02There are 13 movies for LBT
06there was that stupid tinysaur one
02There's also a cartoon series
Well I'm so much SAD of a former fan that I have all 13
02That's number 11 o3o
06...anything after the 10th was so stupid I don't consider them movires
06movies
02Same
I have the, and I agree wit you
*them
and I tried to watch the cartoon series
06the 10th would have been amazing if it was the same animation as 1-3
I died
definately
06I actually like the 10th for the most part
Also, Why is it that Don Bluth at the beginning made so many depressing films?
02The whole thing would've been better if they actually had the correct characteristics for each character
02Because he was actually free to do so
06UGH
what was the other series that I am a poor former fan to...
IT had a mouse
in AMERIKA
06LOL
yeah I have all those too
02I thought you were talking about Secret of NIMH for a second
I am SCUM
No
I have thw two movies though
So Don Bluth has killed me with both his good films
and bad ones
D:
oO

06Anastasia was good too <3
NU NOT ANASTASIA
06yessssssssssssssssss
That movie was an expensive disney copy
06I know it's so far from the original story that it's offensive
06but I still love it
oh it is
02Lol so is Aladdin
but then I never did get one thing
02But it's still pretty good XD
Why is was it still called Saint petersburg? XD
"welcome to Saint petersburg in...some timeline.."
yay Diablo!
I guess the movie takes place in what..the 30s?
but I admit, In the dark of the night was awsome
02Well, it's already so far of from the original story that it couldn't hurt to put another thing in lol
I could never get past the first boss in the first one under the church :\
though really, it could have added something more sinister then singing pink bugs
12lolz
i beat it.. and Diablo II as well as the expansion pack...
/me hides
but the problem with thumbelina
02Like those spirit bat creatures
is that she says its impossible for everything
12that song, abeit being creepy and stalker-sih, was entertaining
12<late AGAIN>
12*ish

12after being poisoned, stabbed, beaten, and other things
12he survived...
12and died of hypothermia o3o
02I had a problem with Thumbelina and Cornelius falling in love as they first see each other
czarists couldnt do crap then
02To me: Cornelius loves her because of her voice, and Thumbelina loves him because he's her size

06yup

06Reshiram is 3.2 meters

shorter than Lugia by 7 feet :V
6ovo
06Zekrom is 2.9 meters
06...
06that's TINY
06I could hold a reshiram in my room o-o
2.9 meters = 9.5144357 feet
6My thought exactly.
06I wasn't expecting a 30ft godzilla
06but....15 feet woulda been nice
06then again, a lot of pokemon are super small
06he's 4ft
they just make them much bigger in the anime

Buy socks for more moeny

06they'll last a couple weeks
06but even when the lotion's gone, they're socks
I need new socks!

that sounds kinda gross
so your feet have lotion all over them when you take your socks off? eww
LOL
Good point actually
Don't run in 'em

and why eww Netbooks drf?
this didn't happen owo
/me goes away now
my Lenovo ideaPad S10-3t is cool
/me shall go all throughout dA and fav Silver pictures <3
I just don't like those tiny keyboards on netbooks, and the fact they have crappy CPUs
like 1.6GHz, what? I can't even play decent quality videos on one of those
and 15.4" isn't THAT much bigger than 10 or 11... and I've got a quad core with DDR3 RAM in mine...
why should I want to watch videos on such a thingy, eh?
because?
I hate having the technology limit what I can do with it
I like being able to do whatever I want with what I have XD
and by the way: My netbook is around 800 grams in weight....and the battery lasts 10(!) hours :)
with 3G and WLAN enabled
and I got a multitouch-screen
14I might be getting my android phone next week
cool
14Depends if the contract is accepted XD
I like the techonolgy do what I want to do it. And besides: the keyboard is big enough for me to type with 10 fingers. And I got HUGE hands (ask Arti for it!)
I have a netbook and a regular lappu.
x3
Ergh
14SHINY
what is with people having huge hands?
14SLDFKJSDF
14GO TO DA
I feel like I have such tiny ones
02Hiya
XD
02I did lol
/me spazzes
14*all over
02I was gonna show a picture another friend did. And I already commented on yours XD
SHINY
/me eats

02Aww D:
14This be the android I might be getting http://shop.o2.co.uk/mobile_phone/specification/HTC/Desire
Unfortunately, we are unable to sell to countries outside the UK.
that's stupid
anyway, I recommend the Motorola Milestone
14LOL
same phone
14I hate motorola phones
...
what'd they ever do to you?
I've had no problems with my phone
14I just don't like them
o.o
but it's a smartphone
14Plus HTC's are awesome
not like teh Razr
03;3 to Azure
/me RUNS

12Okay
12xDD
a friend of mine had it quite some time ago
and yeah, HTCs are decent
to fulfill your desire, eh?
14LOL
XD
I've never had HTC, I have no problems with them, I just have no problems with Motorola either
14I still find it funny how the HTC Desire has 1GHz processor
and the Droid is an awesome phone
eh, that beats mine
does it have a keyboard?
14Touchscreen
oh
fail
I hate touchscreen keyboards
like my Omnia II
depends on how much you need to write
14LANCe
Again, I don't want to be limited by the technology
/me throws a car
and touchscreen keyboards are counter-productive to me
so therefore i refuse to get something without a physical keyboard
14k lol
14LANCE MUST DIEEE
14I also had a go on that iPad

I don't so
02I don't think so after reading it
12hmm
05LOL, Twilight. The first time I saw it was as a Potter Puppet Pals animation my dad showed me. xD;
02either*

06gfdekjfkd
06I hate hand sewing
12o-o
06I've pricked my fingers countless times in the past hour
ick
I hate that
06now would be a good time to have my blood sugar tested
06save the doctors the trouble >_>
06I'm bleeding so much from my thumb right now
lol new pokemon ranger game, this time, you get to ride on legends
05D:
02Pressure
02I saw that May
06thats what I'm doing
and have a pichu that plays an instrument
i wish they stopped after the second one
05Don't you have a sewing machine?
06yeah
02Sewing machine's can't do it all
06but I'm working on a piece that a machine would be difficult for
05Oh. I see/
05**.
02[12:41] 02Sewing machine's can't do it all <--
oh god
they're making a remake for OoT
05No they can't do it all, but they're less finger-pricking than a needle and thread!
02OoT?
nintendo has killed many many things DX
ya
05Then again they did invent THIMBLES... /winkwinknudgenudge
for the new 3DS
02OoT?
Ocarina of Time
02I see
05That.
/me dies
06I hate thimbles
money money money money that's all it's about
06I need full use of my fingers to actually control the needle
06dude
06OoT on the 3DS
06I'm sooooooooo ready for it
02Roara's all fired up about it XD
02But then again, it's probably the same thing with Okami Den
06okamiden is for the DS
06it's got a scheduled release date already
/me is talking about the money thing
06oh
2011, RIGHT?
8D
02I'm saying they might not have put too much time in it because they knew that Okami fans will want to buy it right away
06Im not even close to excited for it
06and I'm a massive okami fan
02Same o3o
Shiny, you're right most of the time about things
alot
hopefully capcom put effort into it
06it's gonna fail
hopefully
Shiny; it can never lie to you for being so SHIENE
06okami was a gam you can't really make a sequel from
that's what I said first time
it says something about a sequel, but then it doesn't
02You could make a prequel though *shot*
06no, it takes place afterwards
when does the 3DS come out? I kind of want to get OoT for he ds now
*the
06dunno
06but OoT wont e for the DS
06be
05Uuung. There are too many prequels out there in general.
06I don't think it'll be a reverse-capable game
I think I got accepted into my high school I wanted to go to
05Really? That's great May!
that made my day
06choices for high school wut o-o
02^
05Is it like a private school?
06I thought you do that for college
02^
I'm not going to my assigned one
05xD
06assigned one......wut
02^
and no, it's a charter out of my the borders
/me flees
05I had choices for high school too.
06this coming from a girl where there's only one high school in my entire county
06unless you count the failure school
05I didn't apply to any private schools though 'cause they're expensive. And most of them are Catholic. >__>;;
05Awww. xD; "Failure school"?
02Our county's school shut down years ago and became a house
06lol
/me should attempt to draw another Yellow on the Oekaki
06RP, yeah
we have 2, rival ones
02So we have to go to another county's school lol
Roara, when you get of middle school, you usually are assigned a high school to go to depending on location
06if you flunk out of the main HS
06you go to that one
well, at least out here in the lausd it is
05There are like twelve high schools in my city.
06and that one is pretty much a dilenquent school
06I drove by it once
02That's how it is here too May
06there's a massive fence around it
So either way you get to hear "Down with!(insertschoolnamehere)"
14wb Sneas :3
02Lol same with our two schools
12cookies
but anyways, if you don't want to go to your "home" school, you have to apply to open enrollment to another
02o3o
05We have three "alternative schools" too in my district. But that's 'cause we're inner-city.
tbh I hate both
*for
06<May> Roara, when you get of middle school, you usually are assigned a high school to go to depending on location <-so it works how middle schools/elementray schools work then..
exactly
06huh
what area do you live in then?
06I always thought high school would be a choice thing in bigger cities
05I had magnet school choices for Middle/Elementary school. o-o
no county is that centeralized
02My middle school is connected to my high school o3o
12Yus, WB :3
12And
the valley, Darkness, in Cali
in ways of having education planning that is
12I might not be on a whole lot this week
06we have two middle schools, and a load of elementary schools
06plus 2 k-8
14:<
12Need to catch up and start some drawings before I leave Friday.
05I think there are over a hundred elementary schools in my district. /dies
12xD
12Like, now
06wow lol
12for example
/me is sad :<
05But some of them are small, like around 200 kids or so.
big city?
12D:
I wouldnt count how many in mine, I barely know any
/me hugs
05Omaha, NE, FTW.
/me wants moar Azure this week :<
06200 is small?
RP: to think Harry Haywood and Malcom X came from there XD
02My county's old school only held about 24 students lol
/me runs
06that's about the size of our schools
06*elementary
12XD
05City's packed this week. >< Grrr College World Series! On the plus side though I see my city every day on ESPN! x3
12I'll be on more later, when I dun feel like drawing :3
05M. X was only born here, LOL.

05And President Gerald Ford was born here too.
oh 'him'
03k xD
yeah Indochina will never forgive him XD
05But Henry Fonda was born here. HE WENT TO MY SCHOOL OMGOMGOMG. <333
Roara, 200 is pretty small for a big city
05Academy Award winners
05FOR THE WIN.
San Fernado is over populated, so it's rare to see a school that size
05Yeah. Well, actually, I know a couple of the downtown schools with around 180 kids, so meh.
"and the academy award...DOES NOT go to RP4life"
/me dies
05xD
05My acting isn't that great.
05I do musicals and stuff but I'm not movie material or even Tony material.
ew, musicals o.e
05OOO:
05OOOOOOOOOO:
I only liked one
inb4 "ew high school musical"?
/me runs
05H--HOW CA--CAN YOU SAY THAT?!?!

05Musicals are amazing!!!!!!!!

06I saw parts of that, RP
05What?
I liked that one
05Joseph?
06wtf is with the costuming
02Hairspray
06hairspray was awesome
02|D
05It has the best costuming ever! What are you talking about!? xD
Hairspray (I mean the old one) was epic
I prefer Muslim Magomaev when it comes to musical
pretty funny =D
05Elvis/Pharaoh = Awesomeness.
02What a coincidence I'm listening to their music right now lol
my mom wanted to see the new one
noooo
05What music Shiny?
don't
yucky zac effron
02Hairspray
05Ew Efron. Rene Auberjonois for the win. He's won a Tony and got nominated three other times.
05Hi Lugia. ^___^

o3o
02Watch Greece (Lightning) then lol
I got two favs lol
Heya RP4L ;>
Greece was good too
05Grease is great too. I was in that in middle school. xP
*Grease
05Broadway version > Movie.
02Grease* yeah XD
/me needs to stop thining ancient Greek
Grease 2 = no
05Speaking of ancient Greece.
02That's ok Darkness o3o
05Antigone = Epic no?
14Awww
Antigone?
05O:
/me has to do dishes
is that a musical?
02D:
14bbs >.<
05No it's an ancient Greek play xD
2gah
Shiny: but its muslim magomaev D:
oh
2D:<
like orpheus and the odyssey
2Ochame Kinou is WAAAY too addicting
05Um... kind of. ^^;
I love those two
05Odyssey = pretty different from Antigone/Oedipus/etc.
06EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW OEDIPUS
05Oedipus was probably the most inappropriate thing I've ever had to read for school LOL. It could've easily been made into an R-Rated movie. xD
06I had to read it in frosh year
06._.;;
05But Roara it was EPIC.
06nooooooooooooooooooooo
05Way better than Odyssey~
owO
05Odyssey was HORRIBLE.
06never read odyssey
06so ha
I don't wanna read that it sounds like
06May
05Well if you read it you'd know how bad it was.
06ever heard of the "oedipus complex"?
/me has.
no
RP: we're reading that next year XD
oh wait
YES
06where a boy falls in love with his mother
INCESY
05That's basically the whole play.
yeah
06it's basically a story about where that term came from
&T
compared to kataan
06and its....a disturbing play
*kataang
05Oedipus falls for his momma and there's lots of suicide and stuff.
I've heard of that
creepy
05That's basically the whole play.
06and I remember something about someone missing their eye
RP: because of incest? o3o
05Yup!
06because it got cut out>
Mornin'
05No I think she stabbed it out with a broach.
06^
...
06that was it
05Yeah. xDD
06yeah kipi, nice time to join lmao
05Hi Kipi! LOL.
05Did you have to read.. ah.. Julius Caesar Aurora?
06ugh yes
05I actually kind of liked that one.
06hated that just as much
06but then again
14http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q7Cy3qSwKI&feature=related <--- Just as good as Bananaphone! XD
06I read that one in my most screwed up HS year ever
06when I had 3 english teachers in one year
05D:
05Oh man!
06one for first semester
06transferred when he left the school
06so our whole class got transferred into another teacher's class
05Was it your Sophomore year?
you guys wouldnt believe the misinformation thats been going around... my cousin told me last night that she wanted an iphone 4 because it was totally solar powered.
06and then she got arrested on campus for being drunk (and we did absolutely NOTHING in that class, literally)
05Wow.
06and then the week before she got arrested, I got transferred to the hardest english teacher on campus
06but got an A because I literally learned nothing that year but it was unfair to make me repeat it LOL
06RP, yeah soph year
05Well at least you got that.
05I got a C in AP Lang. and Comp. GRRR.
Roara, funny, I learned the same thing in history like I did last year
05But it was so hard. ;;
06I pulled an A in that one too
Arizona is higher up in history
06it was ALLLLLLLLL essays
05But I was so close to that B mraaah.
06except for latin root bases
06but I was pretty good with those
!espeon
05I got an A on every essay but the tests KILLED ME. Darn my test anxiety. xP
May: thats so ironic you say that XD
05Hi Espeon. ^___^
heya
02Ohai Espeon
05I should probably get back to my Oekaki work.. ff...
/me glances at the sketched out thing. xD
02Oh May's on iScrib :O
02Hi Sky
05Hi Sky!
I'm going to scribble
Heya Sky
/me follows
/me is out
10Hey all
05How's life?
10It's going well, you?
06ugh
06I just stabbed myself with the needle again
02Hurt
06WAT
02...yup
ew, iScrib is being slow
/me noms on Shiny
/me noms back
Roara, you should put on gloves or something
even rubber ones
05I'll be kindaidle.
it helps sometimes =D
02Ugh, it's not connecting me
me neither
iScrib fails now
02fff
02Yes
this sounds so jazz
05JAZZ!
05 /cue Frank Sinatra
05 /nerd
he's danish lol
I'm part danish
/me dies
05xD;
05Is it like slang or something?
/me knows NOTHING
02I mean
No XD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHf9BJdgdBo&feature=related
05Ooooooh.
this sounds very from the jazz era, the 60s :O
though its from the 60s
so it makes complete sense :D
02If it's not working May, why not use the Oekaki?
05Aaaactually the jazz era was more a little earlier than the sixties so... Eheh...
05It was REALLY big in the fifties here.
05And the twenties of course. ;3
50s = golden age
for whom? XD
back then, people were having fun
05The good days of Sinatra, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis... ah... I miss when musicians actually knew how to play instruments...
I love fifties diners
05Modern Rock bands = No talent. xP
05It makes me sad.
RP: and the 20s were semi good for us XD
lies
not so much poland though
Muse = EPIC
english bands are the best
muse=fail
05Percussion especially. Modern drummers think that banging around equals music. There's no art to it anymore. ;;
I can find better music from a 1970 rock band
bah
I love Muse
05@Darkness :: Like RUSH!? :D
Maybe, but I dont like them either XD
05I love Rush so much. They're all kinda old but NEIL PERT. HE IS GOD. <3
/me is going to see them in concert in August with her dad~
the temptation of a joke is so huge XD
but I'll resist it o3o;
05xP
/me floofs
iscrib fails now
"HEY HEy daddy look over there! ITS GOD!" "wut"
it refuses to let me draw
/me dies
i think it always did but :3c
02Lol hey every site has its down time
02Espeon :O
/me wanted to say something to you but forgot
05xD He's like the best living drummer in the nation, maybe the continent.
Espeon has a beard?
lol wut
02floofbeard lol
RP which contient?
that's more Shiny styly
we have 7
I think the server crashed owO
*cough*inantarticamaybe*cough*
lies
well half lies
05Since they're liike.. from Canada I think.
05Name a more talented band here Darkness. --;
02It might have May, if it did they'll probably try to get it back as soon as they can
they must sing the ROYAL canadian kilted yaksman anthem then :3
hmm...the air
big name
05Name someone else who sings, plays bass, and plays the keyboard with his FEET better.
thats the most talented one I hear XD
05Darkness, why do you hate them so much!?
05The talent stares you in the face!
Its more like I dont like the dying age of rock, and disney is killing rock for me
really?
where?
for I see my computer and it doesnt look talented ;P
Disney is a joke!
you shouldn't let that stop you
Its been a joke for the...past 50 years?
I just put them in the category of money making idiots
05Disney has made some good things. Like movies.
name one
05They just destroy the music biz.
that isnt bambi
classic Disney = <3
05Uh, "Lion King"?
14Argh
Yeah
thats been turned into trilogy DX
Lion King has my love all the time
05I mean the original.
the first one though
/me needs human drawing lessons >.<
05The sequels don't count.
or...idk whats the peusdo word for trilogy?
originals are always the best
05@Twilight :: What are you having trouble with?
/me draws humans all the time. ^^
I have the lion king but I dont call it a great movie anymore
14I think I'm okay with the eyes and hair, just everything else XD
07o3o
I call it an entertainment movie
with sad parts
05Okay, then, what's YOUR idea of good?
is there anything you like?
14Me?
/me twitches
06CURSE THIS BLASTED NEEDLE
/me should just wear bandaids
05That last message of mine was to Darkness.
no, I meant Darkness too
05o-o
not bad of an idea, Roara
something like Flying of the Cranes or Come and See. With some actual meaning and reason, along with other countless movies they've made but I can't name all the ones since I can barely find some
I used that to prevent my skins peeling off in my dress shoes >>
06The ony finger that hasn't been stabbed yet is my left pinky
that was to RP and May XD
06but watch me stab it in a few minutes ._.
/me looks at the clock
02Aaand GO!
05Geez, Darkness. You seem kinda picky about your movies.
/me shoots iscrib
ok who bets 5 dollars she'll stab her last salvation finger?
02:O
/me dies
blasted site
02It will be up soon, I'm sure
RP: I've seen good movies I've seen bad movies, I basically have my reason to be picky with not only hollywood movies but all movies
I wonder if it's connection is closed for a lot of people, not just you and I
hollywood sucks now
it sucks
I should know
14Wait
02Hollywould was never that grand to begin with
14You guys are on iScrib? o:
02Trying to
yes
02But it's not working so...
it's down for us
May: I know it sucks
14Lemme try...
Flying with the Cranes was a 1950s movie
05Have you seen Persepolis, Darkness?
whoo works!
it beats mostly every movie from 2010
RP: I've been trying to find a different movie, so no
Darkness, I live pretty much next door from Hollywood
I feel sorry for youi
I prefer Broadway
05"Persepolis" was amazing. Yay for French films. Very powerful.
it's not quiet, that's a plus
05BROADWAY!!
05<3
sure
I loved Oklahoma
RP: Come and See could beat it
02Yeah, is it working?
I've been forced to watch some of the classics
though I dont recommend you watch it
yup
05Mrrr. I think Oklahoma is okay. =/
mainly because its such a depressing movie
02Told ya they'd fix it May lol
05But Greenwillow and I Remember Mama are so underrated but very good.
MAH IS STILL THERE
*CAT
05And Aida~ It's very modern but so cool.
I saw a poster of that in Gen. Music
05Aida?
Well
I saw something egyptian with tn ithe word Aida o

03WHY
06.....LOL
12We were just narrating emo phrases the whole way
03Do you LIKE intensive mindrape?
12It was hilarious
04I think the wolves are cool in that and that's about it, never seen it
06^
04I saw trailers though.
03I seriously want to go into Twilight 3 and start shouting random crap
03and then leave
03XD
06lol
12The wolves were awesome but Edward friggin cullen
04I think Blade should make a guest appearance in the next film to slaughter all the wimpy vamps.
12annoys the flying fish out of me
06^
03screw wolves
03there is nothing *good* in that movie
03at all
12Every phrase from his mouth is an emo poem
03besides maybe the fact that it's over
12It was SO funny
06LOL
04When the actor was in Harry Potter, he jumped out of a tree then too hehe
06emo poem
03Sigh, stupid Apache
03why am I getting a 403 on my own f'ing computer
12LOL
06hey, he was cool-ish as cedric
12Seriously the whole film is emo emo emooooo
06probably cuz that was a minor role
04It distracts the emos from making poems for a bit, so it has a purpose.
!lag
03:)
12We laughed SO hard
06LOOOOOOOOOOL RN
06that was awesome

12and he just randomly draws a pic of my "boyfriend" being attacked? ovO by a washing machine LOL
14ohai
12It's creepy
12-s
especially....why "boyfriend" and not "future husband"? It would be more correct
12Because he doesn't know me or anything about me and Xai obviously :3
12Whcih makes it even creepier
06lol
12o3o
12Anyway
if so he's just an average idiot :P
nothing to be afraid of
12He put Xai's name in quotes too.. that's kind of weird..
14HOLY SWISS CHEESE
14NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
but then again....Bush was also an average idiot...
well...ok...panic!

03at work
03XD
12hai :3
humm
what a mess
03indeed
and inefficient,too
12Looks pretty normal for most network hubs in businesses ¬¬
12your hub is from a tub of speghetti?
/me flees
/me hugs ^^
03LOL
03wait
12*spaghetti

03s
LOLz
03every one of those green lights is a hard drive
06that's your hub drf?
06that's....so small
the hubs are interconnected with copper cable
03there's more below it too, it got cut off
03Reshiram, seriously?
not via fibre channel
/me rubbs his head TTÏTT
06the first pic
06unless I'm thinking of something else
12X3
03o.o
06also Kyu
06I don't know if I have any wire around the house
07o3o
06you probably wont have glasses for your plush
06as was my original plan
14Ohai LL ^^
but then again - reminds me of the network rooms we had in my old office
07o3o;
06I'll take a look around
with one difference: We had 12 rooms looking like that - well, similar at least
03o.o
03well
03we have 5 buildings
03that's one of them.
03the one I work at
o.o
03each one has their own server room
14:3
inefficient
03tell them that
why not ONE tower rack with ESX machines on them?
03http://img707.imageshack.us/img707/2046/20100621095239.jpg <-- anyway, this is about 1/3 of our Linux cluster
03o.o
03that's basically a bunch of quad-core workstations wired together
03to get well over 100 CPUs
12figures YOU work at a place like THAT drf o3o
/me hides
just 100?
that's half of a rack
and lol, what kind of retard puts ordinary workstations into a 19" rack?^^
03Dunno
03it's kinda cluttered, yeah
12must...resist...bad joke...
/me hides
03they *told* me it was over 100 CPUs
03500 is over 100
/me hides
humm
awaiting commands :{P
03we have so many comptuers we ran out of space
03and have them all over the office too
03though that's part of what I did today
03is help clean the place up
03so we can put up more racks
03XD
are those just desktop pc cases stood on their sides?
03Yep.
03LOL
03they're Dell OptiPlex workstations
ha
035400 and 5500
03there's literally hundreds of those lying around
thought you'd have like blades or something
03blades?
04hellooooo
03we also have Dell PowerEdge servers, but those aren't used for the Linux clusters
http://www.linux-magazin.de/var/linux_magazin/storage/images/media/images/ibm_p510/72940-1-ger-DE/ibm_p510.jpg
now - THAT'S a server
/me hugs
04Hiya LL
/me also hugs
03I didn't take a picture of it
we got around 40 of those in one of our datacenters...
03not quite as tall
of which we have FOUR :)
03ours is probably have that size
03...LOL>
03well we only have like 350 employees
/me huggles back
03we don't need over 9000 servers
12hai lol
03anyway, bbl dinner
you're fine with just one
12hmm
12bai drf
/me puts a sign on LL "FREE HUGS"
/me hides
because those are virtualized systems. One rack can be either one, ten, fifty or one thousand servers - depends on CPU time you need
04lol
/me giggles

03I have a little table next to my bed

06^sounds like me
04That's what everyone tells me to do but I won't
K xD
I'm using CGI:IRC
Arma
it's going to lag like <censored>
06I did that to my dog whenever she bit me
Where am I nommed
04He doesn't respond to water or shouting
06it actually worked
/me shot
06it's a dominace display
03LOL
03I usually just start yelling at my doig
03*dog
06^that works too
you know - there's a very simple way to get him stop chewing on things :)
03it really doesn't
04Have his teeth removed? LOL
fff LL
03my dog's 8, she still tries to kill me
06drf, how old-
06oj
06oh
12o-o
god damn it
o.o
all you need is a battery, a capacitor and some copper wire
4,1BEHOLD THE POWER MORE EPIC THAN UR MOM
14wft

06older dogs are harder to put in place
04I'm not gonna electrocute my dog :P hehe
12wb o3o
o.o

damnit LL
03you know
Grr
I told you not to post logs
03everybody misuses the word electrocute
12all you need
!setgreet Meow~
03that word means to be KILLED by electricity
it's lagging like <censored>
12to do is shave them
03if you just get shocked
03it's not electrocution
12then they behave 8D
03it's just being shocked
12I didn't see it until AFTEr I did ._.
04lol shave them
12sorry
capacitor is charged by battery, capacitor is connected to copper wire, dog bites the wire or touches it with his wet mouth, capacitor discharges on his tongue
.-.
bet 20.000 volts don't taste THAT delicious
04I wouldn't be comfortable with doing that to my dog, hehe
/me leaves. lol.
04but thanks

03but really, how does that not kill them?

04It might cause him to have a fit - Jack Russells are prone to fits
12LMFAO

12Well night all ^^
12not 20,000
Cya Sneasle
04yeah that's European
03why the .000 then?
04Night
03why not just 20?
/me hides
03o.o?
twenty thousand
04On mainland Europe they say 20.000 instead of 20,000
03that's what I thought.
04and they say 1,0% instead of 1.0%
12NIGHT XD
04NIGHT
06DAY
14AFTERNOON
12who wants to win 1.000.000 dollars
12lolz
03you can't have two decimals
They say 1,0%? Wth.
03in a number
03:P
12i know
yep, we do
12it makes the gameshow sound stupid
04I meant 1,2%
04I am bad at maths :P
and it's more natural in fact
12lol RN
04something like that lol
oh gosh
>:
a , splits sentences, right?
/me nods
scribbling grass all over the place hurts the hand
04I'm going to
04bed*
12night RN~
04Night night!
12i find it hard to believe a battery can produce 20,000 volts
If you're using it in that context, then it'd be 1, 2%, not 1,2%.
03you need a transformers
of course
03-s
03I prefer Optimus myself
/me hides
12i mean most electric fense thingies are only capable of 10,000 volts
I didn't say anything about the ampere used by the charge
voltage is one thing, current the other
that's why I said you'd need a capacitor
12a capacitor only stores a charge
12it doesn't amplify it
this one would be charged by just a VERY LOW amount of amperage, but convert it into a HIGH amount of voltage
depends on what kind you take
!lag
remember the camera flashes?
same function
12o.o
03when I was taking apart a disposable camera
03a single AA did ALL THAT damager
03-r
Were you trying to make a taser?
03No LOL
12nah
03I just took it apart to see how a camera worked
12o.o
12he was making his own youtube show
03and touched the little shiny thing
12"how to hurt yourself"
03and ZAP
03LOL No
12fine
12typical w/e
12"funny ways to be an emo"
/me flees
03LOL what
03taking apart a camera is typical? What?
12nvm
well, if you want to have a fancy shock, open a television (one of the older one's) whilst on full energy and touch one of the capacitors
03I didn't WANT to get hurt ><
you'll be hit by around 500,000 volts then
03I just didn't know better
Lol, a 'fancy shock'.
a friend of mine did it once by mistake, trying to fix a computer
Well, I bet they never did it again - lesson learned. XD
he was catapulted around five meters cross the entire room, crushing his couch and a table
03WTF
what do you expect?
03and what does fixing a computer have to do with taking apart a TV
depends on what you try to fix on your computer
open and try to fix the PSU = BAD IDEA
03yeah but you said TV
even if not connected to the power, the capacitors can still carry a charge able to stop an average heart
14o.o
well, then it was just my bad. Sorry - had quite a stressful day today
which is...welll....over since around half an hour
so a new day began. A new day full of work, full of stress and an even more confused me

I say again, it's awesome. :D
OK now I did it
Oh, I just had a good idea, I can have the flash banner choose from a number of different banners to load one, at random, when the page is loaded.
14Like a style switcher?
Well, it'd be interesting to have people wondering why I have to different banners on the same page. :o
I mean a banner as in for a signature (some of the forums I use allow .swfs).

12I don't have logs that far back myself...
03I might, but what would I even look for o.o
A parent SWF, which loads one of a number of other SWFs at random, which means every refresh of the page could show my banner as a different one, and that even if there are two of my posts on the same page, my banner might be different. :o
06lol
some discussion on gender XD

"I can be tamed"

oh yeah
D:<
That was the first time I've hear heard it
what?
03thanks
yeah
:D
they were in town a couple months ago playing next door to me vs myself
Isn't that guy's voice amazing?
I watched for a bit but it wasn't too intense since I was in the back
and I downloaded their new CD and I listened to it once but I was busy doing something and wasn't paying that much attention...
I don't believe they've ever said how it's pronounced
I'll have to listen to it again when I'm in a hardcore mood
Their newest is Crisis, yes?
ummm idk the one with the bird on it
Hmm
that's what the one guy said was newest he could be wrong
That might be Old Crows/Young Cardinals
I'm not sure which is their newest
xD
yeah that is the one
I like Crisis the best, though
I'll listen to it when I get the chance
hmm
Awesome :3
do you like of mice and men
i've been debating whether or not to get their new one is it good
no, they scream too much
:P
Of Mice and Men is a band?
yeah
the book I like
yes
o.O
but the band is too screamo-ish
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzft8E-RMIY
they did a poker face cover
XD
"Poker face cover"?
there are way too many screamo covers of pop songs, it isn't funny any more it's just getting old
12wb
/me was forced to make a mep part to a rock version of "milkshake" today and is so sick of the cover of it
cover means another band does the same song
O_o
How did this comment ever get 72 thumbs up?
all you mother [censored]ers quit your god [censored] [censored]in you mother [censored]in [censored]er [censored]s. This [censored]ing song is the [censored]ing bomb. and if you dont [censored]ing agree with me im going to rip out your eyes and skull [censored] you then rip off your head and [censored] down your [censored]ing [censored] neck because there's no need for you [censored]ing needless [censored] suckers in this world? to [ce
12oww
woah woah woah
what is that?
...LOL
The highest rated comment
on the Poker Face video
for the humor of it probably
LOL
On a side note, that song scares me
that band scares me
:3
right now i've been on a 90s emo kick hahahahahah
good 90s emo song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FV-HPOHu8mY
i have that album actually it's great
/me mixes it with lambchops to make a health potion
GIVE YAH THIS SADNESS, WAAAAH OHHH OHHH OHHH OHHHHHHH~
/me eats it with its serpeant head o3o
if you dont you need to get it
no I don't
what is the album called?
it's got trophies on the cover
I find it hard to beleive that band is considered emo
most of their music seems happy
because it's real emo, people these days think that hawthorne heights and stuff is emo when it's not
it's hard to explain what the real definition is of it but I know it when I hear it
blarg
blarg?
really good bands

03http://www.lugia.us/Peas/?635
03there
I own games for nes, snes, n64, ps1, dc, genesis and most portable systems.

Nyte \o/
06this is either the most genius or most stupid way to improvise with a glue gun
07o3o;
12o-o
12you mean using a gluegun to help make duct tape stronger?
you just now noticed me here? :P
06lol

06its spewing glue
12you wounded it D:
12it's called a gluegun for a reason roara :P
06well
06I'm using mini sticks in a normal size gun
Bored Proto is Bored
06the feeder trigger wont push them in
06so I use another stick to do that
06but because the trigger cant push them in, it cant stop them
06so its just spewing glue until the stick is gone
12lol
07[21:46:06] <%Reshiram> this is either the most genius or most stupid way to improvise with a glue gun
12you have no control
07so i'm guessing the latter?
12so yeah it'd a bad thing XD
12*it's
06Xd
06XD

07or run to a dollar store and just get a cheapo glue gun lol
12well
12you save on them then
12with what's leftover in the gluegun
12more glue can only be a good thing
06our dollar store is stupid
065 bucks it wont have obe
06one

morning
Didn't get much sleep
Hi Proto!
Hallo
There's plenty of time to sleep when I'm dead
that's not technically "sleeping" per sey
It's sleeping on steroids -- makes sleeping look like awakefulness :3
02o.o
02sorry Drake
02well
02I got what matched my expectations
02but my mum won't be happy with it
02well, almost
02to my expectations
04...
04I hate when parents go "Oh get this and I'll be happy"
02just got a C for Science which is kinda disappointing
02oh lol
02You should see
04Then you get it and go "It's ok but YOU SUCK
02what the school is going to have next term
02Scholaris
04...
04wat
02Basically
04is that
02Teachers etc. can upload assignments onto it
02and you can see your daily reports , progress, timetables etc.
02and parents have their own login
02and they can see your stuff too
/me facepalm
02I like Scholaris but that's the only real downside
:3
02heya

02and tinypic is beeing dodgy
ra
hi
lol hi
planet51 is kinda lame
you also at work?
yep
OF COURSE IT'S LAME
I see any animated movie these days that isn't Pixar and expect it to suck
you seen it?
and usually I'm right
:D
nope, but it's animated and not Pixar, therefore suck
:P
it's flawless logic, really
haven't seen an exception except HTTYD
yeh true
httyd was amazing
rather than going "THIS LOOKS GOOD" and "THAT LOOKS GOOD", I just think it's gonna suk
*suck
like that guardians of w/e movie with the talking owls
WTF is that cra
p
it's gonna suck
:)
have you heard the voices?? LOOOL
yeah, they're stupid
but I know some people on TST are all "The movie woulda been good if not for the vocies"
I'm gonna watch it anyway because I wnt to see if its better than average
NO, absolutely not, it's about talking owls, it SUCKS
I'm sorry XD
but seriously
it's animated and it's not by Pixar, it sucks
end of story
:D
its not about talking owls lol
yes it is
riight
all the characters are fricking owls
and they talk
so talking owls
and lion king is about talking lions
yes it is
/me hides
Lion King is more or less Hamlet with less incest
:P
drf you are utterly stupid
why, just because I don't like stupid animal movies?
no
because you're narrow minded
matrix is about talking people
no, I just expect movies to have something more than just an average plotline
LOL
but seriously
the majority of movies these days suck, which is why the good ones are *good*
yeh ok but you can't just see a trailer and say oh that's about a cat and nothing else
I didn't say it's about nothing else
I just saw it and was like WTF talking owls
you did
OK you know what, nvm LOL
you said its about talking owls
It might not be *about* talking owls
but it still has them
:)
implying thats the plot
lol
yes
no, I'm just saying it HAS talking owls
nvm
you misinterpreted me
or maybe I mis-spoke
w/e
and it looks stupid but the animation is awesome
and I'm gonna watch it to see what the plot actually is
the animation is good yes but good animation with a crappy story is still crap
I'm just not, it looks like another dumb kids' movie
the fact that they only show the preview before kids movies kinda proves it LOL
well, Toy Story 3 is more than just a kids movie but it's rated G so they threw it in there
?
what?
Like
they do what?
if the movie's rated G, they show you trailers for G and PG movies
if it's R, they show you previews for PG-13 and R
etc
they won't show trailers for PG-13 movies in front of G rated movies
I get it
so there were only so many they could show before TS3 XD
LOL
I can't wait to see ts3
yeah
it's really good
I'm gonna see it a second time XD
LOL I saw httyd twice
once ib 3d
which was way better
I saw TS3 in 3D
but I wanna see it in IMAX
imax 3D
?
Yes.
I just saw it in normal 3D LOL
not like red and blue....?
what's normal 3D then?
switch those two sentences around
it'll make more sense lol

Well but it still refuses to work. I just try to make something that makes you say something when you join any channel, but not when someone else does.
How did you put in the brackets, I think if there is not a space between the if, and the open bracket it doesn't work.
there's spaces

12Stupid site
what's up Arti?
12Check out the site..
12It's been down for hours...
/me nods
O_o
oooh there's more spam there now
12LOL
looks corrupt to me
oh wow.... o.o
what the frick happened?
i for one like this new site design
I sure hope you had a backup
14LOL Andrew
and the forums?
12It's not corrupt
12lol Andrew
12Just that it's not connecting to the database
12any idea why?
14<Articuno> It's been down for hours... <--- really?
12@Arti
12ues
12*yes
14I'm connected now
12Ovo
14It works fine O.o
12o.o
12To the site?
14Yeah
12Have you tried F5?>
Clear your temporary files and look again
Why wouldn't it connect to the database?
could it have something to do with the domain host?
12Because there's a problem on the host end
I think I get it
Who's hosting?
arti half the internet is broken atm
12Cyberhostpro
12Lol
hmm
12Not the half I've been on *runs*
i'm serious btw
I guess I'll use the time to train this new UU rain dance team to lv. 50
In fact, I've spent the whole week with little rest doing just that.
:o
Pokemon Addiction?
well, that would be just a bit exaggerated. If i'm addicted to anything, it would be TF2
and I am
so yeah, I'm just struggling to finish these games to prepare for even more
even more?
didn't you see E3?
Plus, I'm going to add a few more games to the collection X.X
ok
lol

yep
that's what Arti's trying to fix
12I can't fix it lol
12It's the hostg

!lag
!lag
[Andrew] Lag with nest.lugia.us is 2.153secs
My cousin is so stupid
14!lag
[Twilight] Lag with nest.lugia.us is 1.124secs
The connection has been ridiculously slow because she's downloading 5 movies at once
!lag
[Absol] Lag with nest.lugia.us is 2.152secs
orly.
!lag
so if it's the hosting... then it'll be out until the hosting is resolved?
<.< And when I told her, "It goes a lot faster when you only download one movie at a time", she said, "I know, but they're hard to find so I start the download on all of them."
12BBL
kk
12BBL~
14kk
And I told her, "Well, you could start the download but pause them so only one is downloading at a time", and ger responce was, "I know, but I want all of them at once" =.=
wow

12Hi
12We are now using litespeed technology to make websites allot faster however this has caused a issue with some sites not being able to connect to MySQL, litespeed should of been a none downtime update. We are investigating this and expect to have a fix within a hour.
12
1222/06/2010 20:42
12this has been fixed on manclinux1. only manclinux2 left to fix.

7Hey, Arti. :3
7Leaving in two days.
7Hope you can get that contest done in my possible absence.
12I was thinking that
12and you can sort out the prize after you return
7Okay. :D
12^^
someone should tell them NOT to test such things on LIVE SYSTEMS
12Lol
12Find me a better host
14http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uHcEidRRiY&feature=related <--- <3
12Because I have to pay £230 on July 3rd if not
I have one. Downside: He costs about the double amount
but this one has decent SLAs
03Jeez, my stupid router
!define SLA
-!- service level agreement; stereolithography apparatus; specific leaf area; Sudan Liberation Army, also known as SLM; sealed lead-acid battery; second language acquisition
the first one
12LMAO
12I'd rather not pay double the amount :3
12I'd just like a standard host that has decent database connectivity
03http://img692.imageshack.us/img692/4184/dsc01580zq.jpg <- my work clothes
03XD
03it's "business casual'
12LOL
12Cool :3
03I think I don't look as overweight with dress clothes
03though they're not that comfortable >_>
12Yeh I hate wearing work clothes, I like how they look on me but they're uncomfortable
you get what you pay for
12I'm sorry but I've never heard of anyone pay such high prices for standard shared hosting
03what's this about?
12Hosting
03which host
12Mine
who said "standard shared hosting"?
12Thats just it, I want standard shared hosting
12I just need a decent host
03Dreamhost for $8 a year?
/me hides
12You KNOW that sucks
03no it doesn't
03I've never had any problems with it
12....
12OMG
12SERIOUSLY
12HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION DRF???
12YOU'RE JUST SOOOO STUPID D:
drf....can you imagine what SIZE TST is atm?
12GET OUT OF MY SIGHT XD
03LOL
I'ma go now
Buh bye
03on my Dreamhost?
03still works fine
12YOU IDIOT
03I don't use *databases* but yeah
12HOW MANY TIMES
12THERE
03Articuno, I SHOWED you a database
12THATS THE PROBLEM
03that was hosted by them
03and you said it worked fine
12Where?
03until I told you who hosted it
and what does it have in common with DATABASE ACCESS?
03...
03but he hosted it on DreamHost VPS and it worked fine
example?
12....
03how am I stubborn? I'm just pointing out that cheap stuff can be good
03ever heard of eBay?
if europeans are talking about a 3-litre-car, they mean a car only needing 3 liters per 100 kilometers...
03I never use the term "3 liter car" so what's the point?
03I use the term 'car"
/me runs
03I could give a crap about that, honestly, if it has 4 wheels and gets me from place A to place B safely it's fine
and requires the amount of fuel of an average development country's day-production
just to drive out of your garage
12Im sorry but I just don't believe that a server with unlimited EVERYTHING can ever run a database correctly
12For 8.95 a month
03I paid $9 for a full YEAR
/me runs
03but then after that it's like $7 a month
03it was a promo XD
03first year for $9
03and unlike PowWeb they didn't bug me about piracy
03they just let me put whatever I want on it
03what?
like General Motors or Chrysler, eh? ;)
03I like my mom's Honda
03n
03they're made in Alabama
03I don't care where their CEO lives :P
you communist :P
03LOL
03Hondas are made in the USA
...and hamburgers grow on trees...yeah, yeah
03what
of course they are...if that info calms the masses ;)
03No I'm serious
so you usually are not serious?
03their *headquarters* is in Japan, but that means nothing
I knew it all time long
03because it's cheaper
03I hate those people who try to make me feel bad for not driving one of the "big 3"
12So where's this site that runs a mysql database on Dreamhost?
03I'm trying to find it in my logs
03I don't have it memorized -_-
12I think I might just leave this till next year considering the host gave me a free 10GB for being a long term customer
0310GB is like, tiny
3Total Free: 4070.50 GB/8333.29 GB
12It is if you pay $8 a month for a crappy host
03LOL
03haven't I suggested OVH already?
12I got 40GB with Powweb..
03I got unlimited with PoWeb...
03*PowWeb
I think it's more like
03stupid 150MB text files
"unlimited!*"
03it's like "We don't keep track but if you start putting 50 gajillion DVDs on there we'll suspend you'
12Havent I told you I wont setup all the server tools and need to have them ready for me to use?
03that's why you have someone do it for you
12Are you offering???
so, why exactly do Microsoft claim Games for Windows LIVE requires the HTTP, HTTPS, and DNS ports forwarded?
as well as some others which we've just got it working without?
12Wtf
12As in the games like minesweeper etc?
12*Multiplayer minesweeper
03sorry, phone
03Articuno, I could install MySQL, from what I hear it's easy LOL
note the LIVE, it's the XBox LIVE service spread to windoze
03but I mean, the reseller can also do it
12That part is Easy, what about Cpanel etc. ?
03you just have to ask them o.o
03...
03it's called ssh
though WLM -does- use the same account
03learn to use Linux you noob
/me hides
12Um no
12I don't have time or patience for it
12I barely have time for TST
03well then that's your problem
12No it isn't a problem
03oh really now
03PowWeb didn't have cpanel either -__
12Yes, because most decent hosts have this stuff setup already
03*-_-
03it has its own proprietary thing
03you're thinking *web* hosting, not *server* hoisting
03*hosting
12No but Powweb had their own alternative and it was actually GOOD
03you need a server for TST
03not just "Oh, here's my personal website"
03that's why
12Wtf? I just want what I have now but CHEAPER
12I don't want the hassle of controlling a server
12i want it done FOR me
03oh that's great
03they removed the forum
03LOL
03the one on DreamHost
03the guy who made it took it down
03I think he was just testing it
03well basically, a dedicated server is like "Here's your login, do whatever you want"
03and you can do whatever you want
12I don't want any of the hassle
03shared hosting is meh, it has more problems since it's *shared*
03um
03I'm quite certain you can install cpanel on a dedi
14Gonna go
12Yeh but I dont want the hassle
03It's a one time setup...
03that's like saying installing Windows is too much of a hassle for you
03that's stupid
12It is hassle
12But I NEED that
12I DONT need a dedicated server
03fine, then let TST go down every 2 seconds, I don't care
drf...what about updates on Linux machines, eh?
03I've offered to help plenty of times >_>
03...
12I am managing fine with this one, I dont care that it goes down once every few months but I care that I pay a lot
they need to be patched like any other server
03why would you need to update a linux machine?
03You can run like, Ubuntu 8.04 and be fine
12DRF TST USED to go down every 2 seconds on Powweb which you seem to think is absolutely great, shows how much you know.
03for that matter I'm still using 9.04
03I never saw it go down at all on PowWeb
03but that one time
12Thats because you never went on the site
03when they accidentally pulled their hosting offline for a day or whatever
03orly
12Yes rly
03I'd go on the forums every once in a while
03just as I do noqw
03*now
12Yeh and back then it used to take over 20 seconds to load
03I just don't go on the *main* site because there's like nothing there
because the services can be exploited easily?
03for you maybe
it happened on TST already
03Linux can be exploited? That's news to me
12Nothing there but all the work I've put in and all the pages I've typed up
12and DRF, it used to be slow for EVERYONE.
we all know you're quite out-of-date
03o.o
03My workstation at work is a computer from 2003 with XP, works faster than most *new* machines
of course you need
03more than half of software "updates" do absolutely nothing
03are you telling me that I need to update my Wii to menu 4.3?
03all that update did was disable homebrew
12DRF it's not a matter of all or nothing you know
03it does absolutely
03same thing goes with like, iTunes
03and any other multimedia programs
drf, you're a dumbnut and will obviously NEVER be able to leave that status
03the new ones don't really do anything but "fix" the "problems", thus being things that are actually useful
Lol, drama.
03like removing DRM from the files
03I said there's nothing NEW on there
he's a retard
03I've seen all the good stuff XD
04hellooooo
12Oh come on we all know that already
03>_>
12He argues about things that he doesn't even know about
03orly?
03how do I not know about software updates
12Like a while back he tried to argue that people couldn't understand how an animal is feeling.
04hellooo
03Articuno, w/e, I don't remember that
03but when it comes to computers I actually *do* know what I'm talking about
Articuno: try http://www.lunarpages.com/basic-hosting/
12Why do you think Powweb is a good host and that TST ran fine on it then?
04Articuno
12Looked at Lunar pages already
04is TST down or something?
12Same stuff, powweb clone
03I never said it was a good host for TST
03I said it was a good host for ME
12I will look at their more expensive stuff
12and no DRF, you actually said it ran fine on Powweb
03but it went down less with PowWeb from what I could tell
12No it didn't XD
03It did
you're on your very first job in a small backyard-fiddle-crap-company and are trying to prove people being wrong who studied computer sciences and computer forensic
12See?
03it might have been slow
03but it was acdtually *there*
that's not just dumb, that's insulting
03I'd rather have slow than *NOT THERE*
12No
12You're stupid I'm sorry but you are
03sigh, if you're gonna go this route... maybe TST just doesn't run on anything and THAT'S your problem
04ooooook I think I'll just go
/me poofs
12Since when doesn't it run on my current host? XD
03you're basically saying there's no server in the world that can handle it
03since it GOES DOWN ALL THE TIME?
12I said it runs fine now, I just want to pay less
7LYON
7D:
12and when did it last go down?
04QUAN
/me hugs
7Hey.
03Articuno, this morning>?
12Um yeh? Thats the same issue that we're having NOW
04How are you?
12Thats ONE ISSUE
03I know it is
7Oh, look, Kel-Al Relish Jr. on AQ.
drf, you're as smart as 15 yards of country road
12and that is happening on the whole host, NOT JUST TST
04ohgod
03I remember it's gone down like 4 times in the past year
12See? XD
04he's is a nightmare
12OH WOW
12FOUR TIMES
03My server's never gone down
03at all
03neither has bayleef, our OVH host
12with powweb I got the "Unable to connect to database" every single week
7You're gonna need a high-melee defense armor for him.
12More than once a week
03well it went down once when some moron rebooted it LOL
12Fyi the static pages on TST still work
do I really need to explain you what the difference between static files and dynamic databases and contents is?
03no
03I know what databases are
03all I'm saying is if your host is so great, why do you keep complaining about them?
12Oh god >v< It's 11pm
03I'm trying to help, forget I even mentioned PowWeb >_>
12I complain that I pay so much for them
03I'm just saying it would work sooo much better on a dedicated server, you just have to set it up once and you'd be fine
12I never said it was perfect either
12Yes Ok so who's offering to set it all up for me then?
03The reseller probably can
04btw Quan
03I linked you to one a while ago
03OVH reseller
7Mmm?
03if not I could probably do it if you gave me the login -_-
12I couldn't find any info in English about their hosting
03installing MySQL is like
03installing any other program on Linux
04are you just entering the contest with that sprite
03you just download the source, build it, and install it
04?*
03it's not really that hard once you've done it
03I could do it >_>
12Do it then!
12and Cpanel while you're at it
7I suppose. o3o
03I'd be willing to...
04well...
12and find me all the specs for the dedicated server on OVH in English
03well I gotta look up cpanel
12and then I'll consider
7If it doesn't qualify, ignore it.
03ovh.co.uk
/me runs
04You're not gonna score well because the contest is mainly judged on accuracy'
7Mmm'kay.
12WTF + Prices
12*@
03yeah nvm that
03Kimsufi is what you want
03http://www.kimsufi.co.uk/
12So all this time you recommended OVH and didn't even look at the price -v- lol and then you wonder whjy I don't take your advise.
03£15 a month gives you 250GB hard drive
12*advice
03No no
03Kimsufi is an OVH reseller
12Thats more than I pay now and thats WAY too much
12Ok, but still too much
it's NOT about the DISK SIZE!
12TST is only about 5-6GB at the mo
12LOL
yes you did
03but YOU were the one who was all "Do you have any idea how much SPACE it takes up?"
035-6GB is nothing
all the time
03most hosts will give you at LEAST 10./..
03also
12I have 20 at the momen
03<usotsuki> we have mysql on Bayleef <-- that's the OVH server we use
12t
12Oh finally a solid answer DRF
03I TOLD YOU YOU COULD DO IT
03We just INSTALLED It
and how much data traffic and cpu time?
03but
03I'm asking uso if you can temporarily host TST on there and see if it works
12No I wanted to know if it actually ran properly or not
12Hmm
03oh
03yeah it runs
03we have a forum
03apparently XD
03I never knew we did
12So.. wtf is Bayleef anyway?
how many MB/s database query, eh?
03http://forum.hoshinet.org/
03there you go
that's the ONLY thing relevant
03Articuno, bayleef is what we named our server XD
03it's like asking what Cube is
03we just called it bayleef
12Right and your server is being provided by......?
03anyway http://forum.hoshinet.org/ <-- that's hosted on OVH
03OVH...
12OVH directly or a reseller?
03directly
12How much?
12Per month
03a ton LOL
12:/
03then again
03we have like 4TB of disk space, a 2.somethingGHz Core 2 Duo, etc
03that's complete overkill for a fourm XD
03*forum
12I'd rather have TST go down 4 times a year than pay more than £230
03we use it for lots more than that
12o_______O
Murrrnapples :3
12So anyway..
03heck, our drives keep filling up -__
03*-_-
03Articuno, anyway, an OVH reseller would be just as good as the normal
03all they do is just sell you an account XD
12Yeh, but I'd need a good price too
03I swear I found one that was less
03as you said it was better than what you paid
03not sure where it was
12Find it again and email me or something with details
03anyway look at that forum I pasted you, that's hosted on there
12I see
12It's fine
03k
12I like the sound of OVH
03OVH is like the biggest provider in Europe
12I just want it somewhat cheaper or maybe the same price as current
03when it comes to dedicated server
03s
03the one I showed you was a "shared dedicated"
03as in they basically just let a bunch of people use one
12Anyway I REALLY need to go now
03OK
12It's 11pm O____o
12I have work and I still have to clean up
03LOL
03cya then
03I'll look around for you
03bbl dinner
12Lol we had to pressure you this much for answers D:
/me slaps DRF
12Night XD
12Night everyone else
14NIght
wow, what a database...
Total posts 209  Total topics 133  Total members 198
I bet my floppy drive somewhere in my archives is fast enough to handle that bit of data :P
04what exactly happened to TST?

the host messed up a technical configuration. Therefore all your browser receives atm. is just a mess of trash data

whew, that's just partly correct to be honest :P
7Goodbye.
HEY
WHAT UP
lol hey
forgot to change my name
NOT MUCH
:P
HOW ABOUT YOU
:o
I'M ON LAST FM LOOKING AT RECCOMENDATIONS AND WAITING FOR THIS HUGE ASS 90s EMO TORRENT TO FINISH DOWNLOADING
IT IS TAKING A VERY LONG TIME
DDDD<
How big?
an LPAR is not just a logical partition, but even an entire independent, logically separate system on one AIX-machine. And there can be up to 40-50 LPARs on one physical machine
idk like 300 mb it has like 4 albums in it
Only 300MB? :P
waiting for it to download before I go looking for more
depends on how much CPU or memory you need
it's taking a long time is my point dude :P
Biggest download I've seen i 70 GB. XD
is*
14Darnit missed Azure D:
I have a 6 gb compilation file waiting on my torrent list
I've seen like 100gb ones where there's a million disney movies in ahaha
10Meep
it's a compilation of anime opening and closing themes xD
oh dear
lol
/me tests this Windows 7 Enterprise disc

03seems to be quite rare, I "copied" it from work XD
ahahah
thats cool
I'm also scouring musicbanter.com for crap
anything I can put my two cents in that comes up :D
lol
because it's been made for companies
03Excactly.
03but not needing a serial = definite plus

as I said: database performance is more relevant
I think the game hates me

5Hi folks.
howdy
Hi rp
and bye - course I'm in bed now
5Oh, heh. All right TS.
INFA ZZZZ
ghrduhgdr
hey
Okay, the game REALLY hates me
03what game?

D;
03XD
03oh
Breeding wise
chat only JUST woke up :D
[censored]ers
It was missing water absorb
:3
So wha do I do? I figure I give it an everstone and reed another one
But no, it has a perfect hp IV
ANYONE WANNA PLAY ME IN POOL REAL FAST HDUFHGDLHUG
^ I love my friends
So I have to give it the weight to transfer that stat over in Ss
wow
lol
THEY said that
I know :P
"I'm not touching you!" "I'm touching me EVERYWHERE."
But thenI would have to breed like 75 more over the next 2 weeks to find one with water absorb and a sassy nature
But

I'm stuck in the sinnojo ruins trying to get a perfect giratina now and I can't escape.
hahahahaah the sound isn't even in sync with the video
Ooh, it works.
Unless I get the giratina, and this giratina has a 1/401 chance of being obatined counting all of my options, the team will be incomplete
So yeah, the game hates me
5Gosh. Tough luck.
5(Like ninety percent of that went over my head. I feel so illiterate.)
All you need to know is because of this little mistake, it will take another 2 months to get this team working
5O-oh. Now I see.
5Yeah that really sucks. x__x
And the worst part is that everything else is set to go except this minor detail of a pokemon.
The team was going to consist of politoed, kabutops, gorebyss, ludicolo (shiny), qwilfish and quagsire.

just away
03wtf is TBB
It's a webstream
03what's TBB?
d
the internet sensation that made those mario paint videos on youtube
he is
03According to Nintendo, playing Mario Paint with an emulator to record videos is piracy, you know
/me hides
He plays it with a SNES
12lolz
03that's still copyright infringement
no
03because the copyrights say you're not allowed to share any game content over the internet
03so by uploading them to YouTube you're breaking the law
03have a nice day :P)
03*:)
/me hides
Well then the whole world is breaking a law
and news flash
03Which is precisely my point.
03which is why I think your arguement is tupid.
03*stupid
if's illegal to use google if you're under 18
it's
2,3[ I am 19.253141 years old ]
03and?
yeah
everyone does
03YouTube even SAYS "NOTHING THAT ISN'T MADE BY YOU CAN BE UPLOADED"
03just because people do
03doesn't mean it's OK
so the world is breaking the law
03*I* don't care
12lol
03but I just hate how you're trying to be a goodie two-shoes here
12I don't think ANYONE cares lol
03just admit that copyright laws are stupid and I'll let you off the hook
Well it's captured from your tv
03:P
12<late>
03not...really
03you plug it into something like a DVD recorder
Just STFU and stop this
03I've made videos like that myself too
/me thinks he's won this arguement XD
/me is no longer away : Gone for 1 hour 40 minutes 52 seconds
12lolz
I never said that
I ended it
:/
nobody wns\
wins*
03fine, take the sissy way out
OMG LIFE!
03Look, I really don't care, I just hate when people try to say I'm a bad person for doing what I do
03as it's not that big of a deal >_>
unfortunately i do have some life
:P
03I'd never actually *steal* something, but copying isn't stealing
06Guesst sounds an aweful lot like flamberge
Well I got over that
03hm
Unfortunately?
I don't really care if it doesn't involve me IRL
so this is nothing to me
i got other obligations to work with as opposed to a beucoup amount of free time

06but it's THERE
06I know it
10last night I was up til 5AM
14I'm just generally finding it hard to sleep at all
How did a rat get in your attic? O_o
03I would have to imagine by walking.
hello everyone!
I mean, I know they're pretty good at climbing, but wth.
03bbl Xbox
oi...jlf
06dari, not sure
06dad says that it coulda climbed our wisteria plant out back
06which I just got done trimming
06so we'll see in a few days when it starves
:)
Lol, we had a large rat the liked to run around our patio, my dad found it dead at the bottom of the garden a couple days ago. I'd assume that one of our neighbour's cats got it.
that*
06with how big ours is, my parents think it could be a possum

10Oh?
I like mine, even though it's <censored> beyond repair :3
14I like that part of my mind Alt :P
14I just hate that part that thinks about certain things
14It gets really annoying when something bugs me and I have no solutions on how to solve it, adding the problem that I can't really talk to anyone about it
that same thing causes me to go from :D to ;_;

I didn't realise they banned accounts for that. :o
10Apparently so
/me sighs
hai
06no not really, but still reeking of awesome
06hi
14They've always banned accounts for copyright
10it's quite silly, you'd think they would actually WANT the songs to stay on there
14Well
10that way more people learn about the song/artist
14^
14I find it funny though
03Copyright laws/lawmakers = stupid and idiots
14Youtube gets ridiculed by copyright, but things like lastfm, internet radio channels stuff like that don't
I think it's more the money-hungry record companies that enforce copyrights, rather than the artists themselves.
10Yeh
14I don't think any of the artists really care
03Capitalism :3
14xD
10They'll keep doing this until it's too l;ate
10late*
10by then everyone will be gone
Meow
03Bark
10the only people that will stick around are paying to keep their accounts lolol
14The day I actually buy a CD is the day I can't physically download anything
I suppose youtube is more in the spotlight, because it's very well known.
03I only buy stuff I support
14last fm is more popular than youtube tbh XD
03Such as games
14Games I buy
14unless they are old and impossible to find
14Emulators ftw
03I could have just downloaded all my DS games on my flashcart but I buy them bucause I support them :3
14I'd rather download them, but that's me
14:P
03Yeah, old games = torrents to me :3
14:>
14hi
03Like HG/SS, I downloaded them to try them out first before I really bought them

Im going to bergen o3o
12blah

04:O
12I g2g ;3;
14To me it's boring as hell

meep
Okies byes LL
12g2g...
oooh
04bai
14Sex, drugs and crime oh yay
okay :3
04D:
14What's fun about those 3 things
not sure why you're not seeing that LOL
14Well
04a lot of thing XD
04things*
14drugs and crime <<< fun? no
10lol
04crime and drugs yes...when u its just a game, its very fun
14Stupid? yes
12bai~
14Even for a game it's stupid XD
bbl lunch
oh
lol
10^
04lol i just hurry up and beat the game, then get free roam and use Spawn vehicle cheats
04xD
14Even that is boring on GTA LOL
04nuu
http://i50.tinypic.com/2iw6rn4.png this is what I'm seeing
14I think the only fun thing is making your character jump off stupidly high buildings to see if he lives or not
14The rest is just pointless and senseless violence lol
04meh, w.e., im just trying to get a 100% complete game
10that's cuz you're on the forums, Espeon
10if you do http://www.lugia.us, you'll get the other thing
same thing all over the site
04i find it like a rediculous level of fun, so...thats just me
but whatever xD
14And I'm saying I can't stand GTA :P
GTA 4 is fun. Physics makes doing stupid stuff far more fun.
to yourself that is
04and last night i just finished like my 14th playthrough of Saints Row 2, XD (love that game with a passion)
14Now, I even found GTA4 boring, it's the same thing lol just with a few new features
Well it obviously is the same thing with a new engine, what I'm saying is that it makes the funny things like jumping off things and glitches even more amusing.
14lol
14I'll just stick to glitching NFS games :P
lol
14Maybe MoH too
the new MoH honestly looks so horribly unoriginal
just random chain of thoughts xD
14Rising Sun ftw
but then again FPS + Original = TILT
I remember that game xD
14XD
dc?

I could try bringing it here.
Not really, you just use sockets.
You can bring it to the server just not this channel lol
#4chan or #spam ideal
Alright
Ooh, spam.
#spam is most ideal
This is how people react
You're tlaking to IRC.

That list came from wikipedia, I think.
for what?
ahh - question: Is something like a volunteer fire brigade/department known where you live?
no idea, why?
just wondering. They're VERY common all around here
and for your previous question, Air horms are awsome. Why wouldn't you want one? XD
because I don't need one :P
o.o
just get the ipod app
and to answer your question again: Most of those volunteer fire brigades are called via air horn
:D
like this here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5Voi53JHJE
06sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeena
Aurooooooooooooooooooooooooooooora
o3o
oh and something more: Do your fire departments also welcome every new year in a very special way - like this? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlWtYD0oTnM
!espeon
14fff stupid autoconnect
14brb again
our fire departments are busy with idiots shooting fireworks off in their houses on new years lol
14That's better
not a single minute to welcome a new year?
06<Altair> our fire departments are busy with idiots shooting fireworks off in their houses on new years lol <-this
xD
i'm sure somewhere in there they celebrate... but not much :P
06but I do run into them at Safeway quite a bit, so they DO have lives
06I see them there the day before new years...so I guess they party in between idiots
quite usual, yeah
our volunteer fire department people have regular jobs and a regular life in fact. They're only firefighters when they need to be
well, it's made to wake people up in fact
06still, it's super musical lol
06ours are so....simple
there's an even more evil one - with a high-power light in it to wake you up guaranteed
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EYdiB6Dw3Y&feature=fvw
06wow that thing would make me deaf
06that's way too high pitched o-o;
at least you're awake then
06it speaks lol
it repeats the radio transmission about the emergency call
in that case "End of test alarm."
06ugh this class is horrible
06and I probably shouldn't have taken it..
06except I need credits
06....oh well WONDERFUL
06the oil well got worse apparently
06the cap was removed
bleh
06it'll be put back on, but fdhuhofdgoidrd
sigh, I failed bigtime
ended up hitting a fence with the SUV and broke the mirri
*mirror
SUV = think slim, drive wide
LOL
well yeah
luckily that's ALL that broke, the thing still drives fine
besides the paint getting a little scratched up, but that's purely cosmetic
06.....LOL
06you hit a fence
yes
swerved into it
06at least it wasn't a Porsche
the official story I'm telling my parents is that I was trying to avoid hitting someone
/me runs
06liek what I almost did
06*like
06and LOL
yeah
that's the thing
I'd rather hit a fence than a car, you know?
06yup
I actually did rear-end a guy once and made my sister swear to never tell anyone
12ENGLAND ARE BACK IN WITH A CHANCE XD
as neither one of our vehicles were damaged
14LOL
06were you making a turn or something?
so I drove away with nothing but a verbal assault
06I mean...you just swerved?
me? yeah
oh
well
yes, I was turning at liek 40mph
/me runs
06...LOL
yeah
probably shoulda hit the brakes a little more
06that's easy with my small car, but an SUV
but I thoguht it would be fun
06LOL
that is, until I hit the fence...
anyway
Articuno
found you some hosting stuff
06at least you didn't flip or something
reminds me of this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QgWRycd7I&feature=related
OVH has normal webhosting (like, cpanel etc) for like 2 pounds a month
I kid you not
breakfaaast
the only thing is there's a bandwidth limit :/, not sure how much traffic TST uses
12Over 30GB a month
2hm
oh that's fine then
2hi Arti
theyg ive you 500GB XD
12Ovo
and for a little more you get 1TB
lemme get the link for you then :)
2TB good
XD
mine has unmetered bandwidth
06TB good unless we're talking disease
/me runs
12This sounds too good to be true LOL
http://www.ovh.co.uk/shared_hosting/
look at the Personal hosting
though it says "Personal SQL: 1x25MB"
not sure if that's what you need lots of space for
12The pro looks better
well whatever suits you XD
12I also need the email accoutns you see
how much do you currently pay for yours?
12More than just 10
12£230 a year, so like £12 a month
12Or so
OK
and 25 megs of database...lol^^
well for 10 pounds a month
you get unlimited everything
:)
basically
12Lame.
06....lol
it's like a shared dedicated server
you get unlimited bandwidth
the space is limited obviously
also 100mbps guaranteed speed
12Surely I'd be able to install MySQL and have it use the normal disk space
and yes
look at this here: http://www.hetzner.de/en/
wait
you mean on the shared hosting? Maybe
12Yes
12I mean shared
oh
You might be able to, I have no experience with MySQL
12I dunno wtf Personal SQL is meant to be XD
and OVH is like the fastest host I know of so yeah
also
lots of their dataservers are in France
so you'd be outside the juristriction of the Digital Copyright Bill or w/e it is
12LOL yeh :>
12Also, LUGIA BOARDS IN 10 MINUTES!
I mean, the one we have is in France
there are a few in English but yeah
wait what? o.o
oh
you mean plane
06speaking of friends on planes :>
I thought you meant lugia boards like forums
nvm
12LOL
06....LOL
Snakes on a Plane?
/me runs
well, Hetzner has one of the biggest and fastest datacenters here
anyway Arti, http://www.ovh.co.uk/products/rps_offers.xml <-- that's the other one
even their cheapest one
would be better than what you ahve SXD
-S
but their shared hosting is more like what you want probably
12lol
well, thinking about what size TST grows, maybe we should think about a small own root-server
/me is still a little in shock
what, you mean a dedicated host? :P
/me looks at cheapest one
we could put IRC onto that server then, too
yep
that's exactly what we do
though the one we have for HoSHiNET is like $150 a month LOL
because we have insane stuff
12http://www.ovh.co.uk/products/rps1.xml
like 4 1TB hard drives, etc
12Can't see a problem with that
exactly
that gives you unlimited bandwidth
you can install MySQL on it
if it doesn't already ahve it, I'm not sure
unlimited bandwidth usually means there's another problem with it
Just as I have to go, *pokes Azure* XD
not if it's a dedicated server
12I could replace the nest IRC server with a proper one so I wouldn't have anymore hassle XD
the RPS is just a dedicated server that's shared among a few people
honestly, I don't trust those "unlimited" offers for entry-prices by experience anymore
which is why it's cheaper
12XD
12Hai
unlimited *Disk space* is kinda bogus yeah
and THAT's the PROBLEM drf
but unlimited bandwidth really isn't
a problem I had already with TWO other servers
you had a RPS?
yeah
hm
12Yeh but OVH is a good one
well I really don't know, all I know is OVH is one of the best places for that
Hai, I'll be back in around a couple of hours
:<
12From what I hear at least :>
I know like 3 people who have servers there
they've all had like 99.9% uptime
if it ever does go down it comes back about a minute later
our IRC server had an uptime of over a year
before someone at the datacenter accidentally rebooted the machine >_>
12Ok >:
12LOL
some routine maintinence crap
but yeah
it came back a minute or two later
we were just like "Aw, there goes our 1 year uptime"
12Well anyway, I need someone to setup Cpanel for me
OK
I probably could, if I find the installer for it XD
I know it exists
12I'd rather have someone do it professionally, so perhaps that is included in setup fee..
MySQL is easy enough too, we have that set up on our dedicated server
maybe
they waive the setup fee if you pay annually :P
I'd either choose Hetzner or HostEurope
I've never heard of either
well then again I don't know much about database hosting
I just stick to cheap ones and they always work fine for me XD
except Cirtex, that place was retarded
first year was fine, then right after I paid for a second year they started having like dialup speeds >_>
and I would either pich quality
pick
... lolwut?
well
the thing with OVH, they're like a professional hosting place, so even their lowest priced one is still good
it's like
we'll see ;)
Bose products
they're all fairly expensive
but even their cheap stuff is good
I have no reason not to trust them
if you want quality stuff, look for Teufel
o.o
also Arti yeah, you can host UnrealIRC on a Linux server :)
12I'm leaning towards OVH simply because I've seen working MYSQL databases on it
LOL these Mibbit faces look so retarded
or Bang&Olufsen
In the 1995 WRC, Toyota drivers had been complaining that they found their cars somewhat lacking in the power department. They were disqualified during the 7th event because it was found the team had been using turbochargers.
How does that add up?
or harman/kardon
12ovo
oh, you're talking about speakers
LOL
I never get anything Bose since it's just overpriced
I like Logitech
but that's besides the point
I was just saying that even their cheap stuff is good
well yeah, but too cheap usually means a lack of performance
Just for fun, I should run speedtest.net on the OVH server
and see what it gets
XD
129.99 a month isn't THAT cheap though
12It's reasonable
a GOOD server requires to be properly priced. Those people don't have anything to donate
yeah
12It means about £100 less than what Im paying now
We basiaclly just added everything we possibly could
including 4 hard drives, a dual core CPU, etc etc
I believe it costs like 150 Euros a month
or something crazy
I have no idea who this HoSHiNET should be, but it sounds retarded
it's a server...
that I'm an admin on
12Thats less than I pay now LOL!
well, suits you
12No wait
12Sorry
I said a month
not a year
XD
12I thought you said a year then XD
nope
12LOOOOL
but the reason we need so much space is that we're an encoding group
we encode like, all the Pokemon movies
TV shows
etc
and store them on there
I found one here - 2GB Ram, 40GB RAID-1-disk-space, 30 databases, 5GB traffic included, Cron-Jobs, SSH-access, freely defineable A and MX-records - everything managed by their staff
availability guaranteed 99%
25/month
then again don't believe everything that you read :P
I still don't see why you're trying to prove me wrong here
Do you just like disagreeing with me or something? >_>
anyway brb
let me phrase it this way: Who's the biggest fool? The fool himself or the one following the fool?
06the village idiot
back
and that's just great
the one guy I need for inventory purposes isn't here
and he took his laptop with him
>_>
hm
I'm gonna attempt to do something crazy
12What?
12Hai
06.....lol
using VNC over a remote access
/me runs
12LMAO
since I have no VNC client here
and I wanna speedtest bayleef
just for fun
ohai
so I'm gonna remote into my home comptuer and use RealVNC on there
XD
just landed in Phoenix XP
EW IPHONES
/me hides
06so my mysterygift arrives tomorrow
06....kyu wtf
12phone
if you manage to test your server with a sufficient big database, we can go ahead
06why phoenix?
now where's Kipi o3o
06that's a huge detour from WISCONSIN
because as I said before: All that counts is database throughput
connecting flight
http://forum.hoshinet.org/
06lol
how many tables, how many mb of DATABASE size?
06so, is it hot over there? :>
I have no idea...
LOL Roara
it's not as big as TST but it still works
Total posts 209  Total topics 133  Total members 198
I'm still in the plane o3o
06and bring me some cheese after the trip
06...lol
06so you literally just landed then
so I dunno the temp
Floof has arrived!
there's not an app for that?
honestly drf? My PHONE could handle a database THAT TINY
/me hides
kbai o3o
eh
I still don't see why you're trying to prove me wrong
06Kyu, 97 degrees
06....
14lol
14XD
I was too obvious
<Omegle> 18 m us
06WELL FINE
15 f us
XD
<Omegle> >> Disconnected.
>.>
WHAT NINE THOUSAND?
/me runs
</random>
06lolwut
nothing
anyway bored XD
TST has around...well....7k users, 40k postings in around 2k topics?
06xD
just waitng for soemthing
*something
plus additional databases for THREE galleries, the news, the oekakis, the cms and more?
so what sort of server specs does the current host have?
as I still don't see why that's a problem
YOU may have around 12 tables with alltogether 2MB of payload - WE have around 400 tables with OVER 300MB of payload in the database
and everytime the size is doubled, the CPU time you need increases by the factor of 4
sigh
I really don't feel like arguing this with you
especially with MySQL, which is terribly imperformant with huge databases
like, it's only because I mentioned it that you're fighting
if Articuno found it on your own you probably wouldn't care
same - I don't like to fight an intellectual battle with unarmed people
I think you just like arguing with me about anything >_>
honestly?
what
first: You don't get the relevant point. You're just unable to get it - no matter how anyone tries to explain it to you. Hell, even my cat has more clue of the topic in the meanwhile than you
06....ok now we're getting a little harsh, guys
Just because I'm not an expert in databases doesn't mean I don't know what a good host is
second: you stay and INSIST YOUR opinion is the right thing. THE ONE AND ONLY right thing. No matter if others tell you other things
and you're not doing that how?
no matter if those people are experienced with it
You're trying to insist that the one YOU found is the one and only right thing and that the one I found isn't
12heh
a little difference between us two drf: I have STUDIED the entire thing and AM WORKING in this metier since more than TEN YEARS
this gives me EXPERIENCE and throughsight - something you lack
having experience with databases is different than picking webhosts out of a hat
FLAMEWARZbant
third: I don't want to pick something just "cheap" or "expensive", I want to pick something the right performance for TST because I think the page DESERVES sufficient reserves for the future. It needs a good reliablility, speed and should be able to grow
10fighting over who has better database experiences.. lol
right, and again, you're just naming random hosts... how is that any different than me recommending OVH?
I know like 3 people personally who have OVh servers and all of them have said it works great
may I give you an example? I ask for database performance, and YOU come and tell me about harddrives and sizes of them
no, I was pointing that out because some cheap hosting doesn't give you enough hard drive space
that's like me talking about an oil spill in the oean and you about a leaking can in your refrigerator
/me stabs his router at home for disconnecting so much
well they both kinda suck so yeah
06holy crap, seriously....this is ridiculous guys
12only Articuno can break this up Aurora
06yeah apparently
06but still
10yeh well, Aurora's stupid enough to tell them to stop
06yeah but sitting around watching these two go at it is really sad >_>
You do realize hard drive space isn't all I mentioned
that was like one thing
I also pointed out that the RPS has unmetered bandwitdh (which is a good thing)
no, I was saying that's the only reason I mentioned hard drive space
and STILL not what was asked
because I was telling her that it has enough space to host TST
...
WHAT exactly was asked then?
Nothing was asked, I was just telling her what I found
topic missed, F, sit down!
I fail to see why this makes me such a fool
/me 7blinks at this discussion.
04heh
thank you
04i don't even understand why arti keeps TS as an OP
I don't start arguements, really, I'll just defend myself if people start making accusations
Uh
what TST needs is CPU performance. That's why Powweb was so damn slow. Because the server was unable to prepare the pages in time
04he's caused so much trouble over the most trivial matters
... that's ALL he does
solution: Just let it pass really
04and when he doesn't get his way
04he takes a long vacation from TST
and I don't understand why she gives half the people op she has
XD
10^
2(Aurora2): Even an ordinary carpet would be smarter in this place
06while I fully support arguments, I support fair arguments
7Wow, across two chats, I spy people arguing about two similar topics.
Aurora and DRF hasn't sometimes made ridiculous statements of the same quality?
06...
06ok why are you an Op then
on a random note
http://img651.imageshack.us/img651/8673/46962646.png
10she picks the wrong people who can't get along at all
06you take things so f-ing seriously
or. rather. she needs to rework her system.
That is probably the biggest waste of resources ever but it works :P)
*:)
with more OPs, and lots more halfops
because when <censored> DOES happen, I swear, NOBODY IS <censored> THERE to do anything about it
Aurora, expertise
12Aurora
12there is no such thing as a fair argument
Articuno realizes this
06which I don't doubt
I really don't think anybody is perfect P
06which is why I want this to NOT be so stupidly argued
*:P
06drf was pointing out his findings
06and apprently that officially means he's FORCING articuno to use it
Aurora, you've also paid attention to Arti and DRFs banters I'm sure
06yes I have
10true
well that's quite true
because you STILL didn't get the point
It's similar really
lol
WHAT POINT? I was just telling her my recommendation!
I dont know why we're heckling on EITHER because of ... argh XD
10she complains she can't find anyone that is a "dedicated" Lugia and Articuno fan
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z4m4lnjxkY&feature=related
..and then ops <censored> to me that I'm not allowed to tell people they aren't allowed to do something
This guy scares me.
10I laugh at that, because there are a few staff there that don't care about that couple at all
06I do't know why you're trying to let them go on like this...the arguing is over some of the stupidest things
06exactly
you mean like all of them?
10most
also Insults doesn't belong in any arguement...
and I tell you out of experience: low prices and unlimited traffic have a catch
Well, Aurora, I'm just regarding this as a similar banter between Arti and DRF
http://www.speedtest.net/result/857146001.png <-- Speedtest results from OVH :D
Just AS silly
...
Just AS resource wasting
but it's common as well
still not understanding what I'm saying
I get what you're saying, I just feel like showing that
DRF is just like that
I'm random, so sue me
/me 7sits across IRCs while waiting for these situations to simmer down.
I would, but as I'm in germany not a single court would accept such a sue here
eh. I thought she was ok
I've been here long enough to know, Aurora
LOL
would be NO PROBLEM there
10she was, until she was modded
also. she only ops people who are already never freaking around
06and now we get into who's been here longer...?
No o.O
06that's stupider than the argument LOL
It was a comment XD
IJSDFHjdfsdsf
06I'm not saying I know them better than you
YOU'RE SUCH A FLOOFHEAD.
10that "I am better than all of you, and will ignore anyone but my circle of friends" attitude showed up shortly after her modship
which adds to the 'nobody's there when you need them' thing
LOL
06that doesn't change the fact that this is out of hand
all the mods are like that though
Really, it's silly
O___o
Espeon is right, I'm rather amused actually
So many random elements
10Kyu not really either
keep in mind I haven't seen their modlist in like. ages
/me 7gets a bucket
just like any other arguement on the internet: It escalates in a predictable manner
or it seems that way, at least <.< >.>
I don't mind Aurora
others I mind though
Espeon: It turns into a liquidy thing of floof
that in the end nobody can keep track of
in a weird way I guess
06I just think that bringing in insults to an argument that really shouldn't have existed is stupid
Eh, I just take it witha grain of salt. In this case, both factions are as ridiculous as the other
He's also German, but I don't know if he's said that. :V
lol
well from what I see he only pops up when he's about to have an arguement but xD
somehow I think I knew already
06I haven't seen anything drf has said as wrong (in this particular argument)
its BECAUSE he pops up
06I know he says stupid things, but still
Maybe not this time, but in general
sarcasm, he says that all the time
Apart from the insults I can't see any of them saying anything wrong
o.o
Hm
oh
still all I want to do is to CARE for TST and the community. And I KNOW what the catch is with too cheap offers combined with "unlimited traffic" and those things. I know it because I tested it myself more than once. With similar sizy communities. And in my business
WELL MY POINT IS that I don't have a point
06that's the thing though, the insults have been somewhat one sided this time around
:V
lawln00b
/me needs to recode his game :(
seriously, all I've done this whole time is defend myself -_-
I should also leave and go get back to work XD
so if it's of any aid and money is the only problem that stops us from picking a performant host instead of a cheap one, I'll pay the compensation out of my own pocket
because I care
10haha, lies
DRF bugger off to work XD It'll all be good in the end~
06again, others DO care
12sometimes more expensive isn't always better
I don't want to see TST run into such a trap like other pages did
yeah, there isn't a community!
I mean
10they're never around when we need them
12i mean look at apples and other computers
I do, but at the "my friends are there and I doubt I can get them to go elsewhere" level
indeed LOL
Heh
lol
10yeh
I'm really there because I see no reason not to... yet
He mentioned IF we have to
He wasn't saying we ARE
mostly its just all noobs now. is kinda why I left to begin with
O-o
12he did state though that cheap hosts have catches
12which isn't always true
06no, but he sure attacked DRF for apparently forcing Arti into his suggestion
no but he seems to be implying that the one I found is "bad"
which is dumb, you can get expensive OVH servers that cost a TON if you want
but it would be complete overkill for what we need
@ attacking DRF - not acceptable, but I was remarking on the actual thing
10I don't really understand why I stay around either
06what actual thing lol
TST has turned into PS to me; a place I really cared about at one time, but then realized core truths about and decided I don't like as much anymore
06I understand both had their ideas
I used to stay for the few friends who refused to leave.
06but there are ways of going about how to say that
the thing which wasn't the attacking of DRF ;p
..but then it turns out they didn't care all that much, so I just left
that or they stopped showing up, etc
04keeping peace in that place
04is a hard job
Or so it seems
06once you start getting aggressive like that, blah
more like impossible
04however, there isn't anything i can do in this situation so i'm just sort of staying out of it lol
set mode +b *!*@*, that should quiet things down
lol staff
sigh
I really don't need this right now
I have work to do LOL
bbl
8D
XD
lol
04i can't +b other mods Quilava
you need the *'s
04well sure i can but they'll just turn them off themselves lol
I love how he's always so happy.
sure you can. it just won't do anything till they leave the chan
Quilava: automatically becomes *!*@*
oh. sweet
04and TS is a freaking admin
06lol
/j #lolz
Kind of like how you can ban a nick by just typing the nick and it'll add !*@*
I actually enjoy the random arguments that occur - though mainly the banters between him and anyone else of his favoured 'I hate apple' topic ^^
04he's taken the personal liberty once for Demodding kyu himself for spamming a word
that one is always interesting
/mode #lolz +b @
no offense, but if he didn't know Arti as well I bet he would be banned for some sort of offense.
yeah, but he's a prick
:/
10?
04i'd hate to see how he reacts if i set a ban on him
04XD
psh, it doesn't matter. say you were joking or something
he would probably make a big deal about it.
and him joking? hah
04TS has no sense of humor :P
TS that is
he makes a big deal of everything
06I don't mind arguments, but I prefer not to let them continue if it's going to end up like that
04Skylands
04i do all that i can
04therefore i have no shame
that'd piss him off more
Arguements doesn't have insults. At least then all respect for the arguement should vanish magically.
inorite
:V
06^
s vs. S
LOL
huge difference
that's what he gets for having a capital letter IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS NAME
04i try to be understanding
to him, at least
Agreed @ Espeon
4 px is a huge difference?
04i try to sit in the other person's shoes and understand their logic and standing on things
i think you're all stupid
06lol
Aurora, agreed there, but the trick is that it's nigh impossible to get the parties to disengage once it's begun
teehee
whiiiich is annoying
How nice
04however
04i've been accused many times
06and so I'm just going to sit around and watch it eat up the channel
06not in my nature
04for arguing just for the sake of disagreeing lol
Wasn't saying that o.O
Was just saying it could be sort of tricky to go it
*go about with it
sdf
aka exactly what TS does?
06nah, you didn't, but I'm explaining why I tried ending it
Fair enough ^^
lol I never seriously argue on the internet. It always just comes down to someone throwing the first insult and floof
*everyone
oh yes
everyone
lopl
04it's only one person who has accused me of that
04but he keeps on accusing me of that on a weekly basis
06now, if this was an actual debate channel, then I'd for sure either get into it (like I did) or sit around
tell them to STFU and ban them
06but this is main, not a debate channel for stuff like that
honestly, I have no problem with discussions and arguments, but this was more like a resume of what was discussed yesterday
04like i said
[19:22] <Espeon> lol I never seriously argue on the internet. It always just comes down to someone throwing the first insult and floof Not always.
04only Articuno is the only one who can jump in
06resuming or not, what was said was said
04and permanently stop this
Aurora: Hm one thing that sort of interesting is
04then TS will get pissed off
06insults have no place in it
04and leave TST for another 2 months
... dude. then get him pissed off
If one topic becomes too dominant in here (bar insults) there is usually attempts to break it up.
him gone = good
I wonder why, personally
04only articuno can piss him off enough though
http://media.fukung.net/images/17647/8056f425d0d61c1bf26c69b735a46e47.gif
oh. what
06BLERUERHGUEHGH, for example
06I know
03ohgod
wait, the first time it was Sky though
04all the times he left was after articuno got involved
04nothing else
o.o
03drama detected.
Anyone else he can just say gtfo b&
BLERUERHGUEHGH lol I dont know how you can spell that right XD
Sneas, its not drama
we're laughing at people who suck
I always lose track halfway through
Sneas: Lawl, e-drama. I don't get involved.
06magic
04i still remember the first time he left
noes
THAT REMINDS ME
06no, I have it saved
oh god, people still find that remotely funny? Like even a single microscopic twitch-funny?
04he had this little art contest
Still <censored> drama to me. :3
06I don't feel like memorizing it
wait, YOU PEOPLE CAN REMEMBER? D:
06espeon, not anymore
oh
good
hax0rz
04where people were supposed to search the forums for how TS's character looked
that would be sad
the drawing thing
06I was pointing it out as one of those huge arguments
04and people were supposed to draw him

Mm
:V
06..
06not as
I remember that.
lul
06wtf >_>
I'm honestly not too involved here anymore
i remembe- fff
Most of you probably can tell
04so he got pissed off and wouldn't even consider the picture
ninja'd
I idle a lot heh
Been sort of seasonal
I bet my script generates more lines than I do myself lol
04TS said he would take it back if he redid the picture but it was a pencil drawing so that isn't really easy to do
Maybes lol
you don't complain about something you get for free
sure you can, you just look like a dick doing so
Oh, he's from Germany right? Wow, true grammar nazi. :o
04eventually we all got on his case and he Nick redid the S, which he won the contest
well true
honestly though, I have a bit of a problem getting over how much my significant other sometimes dislikes the community. He wants to fit in, but feels such an amount of ... exclusion
12o.o
and lol
dari, that's actually not funny for some reason o.O
that I myself become withdrawn. Or so it has been, increasingly
04then TS left TST for like 5 months lol
ever since two years ago
/me pokes Azure and stuff like that
/me ish poked O:
is this a flashback sequence?
AND THERE WAS MUCH REJOICING
No.
aw
I never actually noticed
and by that I mean he was missed
until he returned
this
/me cough
04darnit Espeon
http://i48.tinypic.com/2dl9e2s.gif

04what is that word again?
06!espeon
/me now belongs to Aurora for 15 minutes
what
06GET
meow?
Bird?
04the spammy word that got TS pissed off the 2nd time
Hm
spontaneous combustion?
04the made up one
fwarb?
just look in TST topic :P
yeah
:V
/me facepalms over it still being there
there was an earthquake in the ottawa area
o.o
I'm confused
06lol that gif, @bf
it's like a trophy over making people mad or something
well it's not there actually
oh
it was like recently
04not in the topic
but the BLERwhatever
BLERUERHGUEHGH ?
BLERUERHGUEHGH
04well anyway there was this huge spam spree that got on everyone's nerve
lopl
and if that's quoted as my quote in stats I will rage
04which resulted in creating this word
well yes it did
it sparked multidrama
stats loploplopl
04kyu was legally spamming the word and TS Demodded him for it XD
12Anyways
12raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
wait how can you spam illegally?
/me runs
04articuno remodded him and TS left in a rageful fury
http://fukung.net/v/11444/651a6dda69971b535ba410abf98c70e3.jpg
well the only thing that annoyed me was the fact it was actually the mods who spammed the <censored> out of that word while the regular users mostly just sat there xD
I dislike the whole 'you can spam' thing, but that's SW, so yeah :V
that's how it always is :|
04i know espeon
04Espeon you got to admit though it's funny as hell
No
not at all
I mean. randomly they'll spam about 30 or so pages of text, and expect you to be ok with it
04when another mod gets pissed off at another mod for spamming
oh
well THAT is funny
04then demods them
Hello.
http://www.unf-unf.de/video/Picdump%20-%20sonstige/metalfans-unter-sich-1270041710.jpg
6Hey =D
I remember on SPP there was this rule 'the ops are always right'
:V
04honestly
that is actually hilarious. But I would mentally high-five if TS just stepped in and banned everyone for an hour or something
6How are ya?
04what's the point of spamming
that would be epic
04it doesn't do anything
I dunno, appearently people find it "fun"
04it doesn't make any social progress XD
it makes a wall of text
I mean spamming like scripts and such can be "fun" but just goingashduahdoiusajdoisajd
idk
it's stupid
04script abuse
04isn't equal to spamming in my opinion
04depending on the script
that is so silly that it's funny xD

hiii
04i'm a professor for pokemon TCG
I have no experience because nobody trusts me enough
hiho
04meaning i'm qualified to judge tournaments and make important rulings
4+=1414.32.224=+ <Quilava> I have no experience because nobody trusts me enough <-- this
"experience"
:V
Well, I'm in a good mood, you?
/me goes to level up his authority skills?
lopl
04i heard a rumor POP is starting to do background checks on professors
04that is kind of weird XD
For some reason people doesn't want me to have power in many cases.
o3o
10lol
I'ma go recode my game now <.<; I need to catch up with myself
and nobody wants me in power :| I don't know why.
10Espeon, remember when Aurora said "I think he'd have more fun NOT being a mod"
yeah, lol
I'm just kind of that shady guy in the corner
10tbh I disagree with that
I'm just <censored> :|
for not wanting me
:V
I mean i don't look at being a mod as "fun" xD
but at the same time not as "not fun"
I mean
10you're a mod here and you seem to have even more fun lol
it shouldn't be about mod
fun*
wtf
xD
10and true
I just wanted to be a mod so I could actually, you know, be USEFUL.
instead of everyone saying "STFU UR NOT A MOD"
/me rolls out of her grave
Hey Curly
hi Proto :)
How's you?
http://fukung.net/v/18502/atat.gif <-- talk about rule 34
10or get blamed for "mini modding"
same thing
6Nice.I'm fine,thx.
but you know, if the community can't take care of itself, WHY DO YOU EVEN HAVE MODS
04if it'll make you feel better Quilava
04i can give you an oline on my server lol
lol
04even though nothing much ever happens there anymore
but I don't go to your server
04heh
really, modding shouldn't be about fun or too much about friendship tbh
lol AT-AT's
06why did I even bother to look at that
or wwhatever asjd
I like how people say not to mod friends, because you can't judge them accurately, but that's what everyone does.
um, wondering who Jeremy Jones is
/me eyes the rest of the channel
anybody here know a Jeremy Jones? >.>
04mainly because people think you can't trust someone who isn't a friend
you should trust them based on how they act, not if you like them
04it's a sad corrupt world huh quil?
yes. kinda needs to die
04you mean like he always does?
10most of the current staff are Arti's favourites

04i guarentee i'm not arti's favorite XD
of course they are
10it has never been about doing a job on TST
lol well that's obvious
04i had to work months just to get her to talk to me casually
as a person and not a member?
10regardless of who's good and who's bad at the job
I was never good enough for her. so meh.
I know the feel lol
04she was willing to sacrifice me
04because another mod said they didn't want to work with me
04that was such a long dragged out fight
04x-x
lol. I remember that
04it wasn't funny dude
Lol, I love how drama has died down over there, but is still being talked about here.
04that really did leave a mental scar for a short time

we're just talking about stuff :|
06advice to those who aren't in college yet: do not take summer courses x-x
04i know
04doesn't change the fact how much it hurt though

10who said they didn't want to work with you, if I may ask?
04i'm keeping that info to myself
I already know who.

as I can just do whatever while it's going :)
I was just about to go
xD
anyway I need to redo all of this stuff ><
nevermind
what's up?
Hot food = Win.
6Lol
6Not much..You?
06lucky youuuuuu
04we actually agree on something ;D
same
just enjoying the summer
XD
yeah, this job is cool
06I'm suffering through an unhuman amount of work for this class
Haha.
:()
*:(
04i can't remember what you hated so much
06lolface
04that i'd pick on you about
04i want to say it was the 360
it's a shame I don't have any blank DVDs
or I could burn this Windows 7 Enterprise disc
I dunno, maybe that was it, I just couldn't care less now.
Hello.
6Nice
6Hey
04oh well
04i agree with you now
7hey Malefor
04the 360 is fail
7you know not coming on with your real name is a bannable offence?
04i'm starting to like the wii and the ps3 a lot more
stupid MS Outlook :@
/me stabs it for freezing all the time
I have to say that Nintendo is definitely the most innovative out of all the companies.
this is true
7yeah, but the princess is in another chatroom
6Wb Icy
04nah
and an upgraded PS3 is somewhat meh, due to the fact that it can no longer play PS2 games
6XD
04i never got a RROD
I know, for I have one XD
So.
04but it's just not the system for me
doesn't the wii have like, no good games?
7oh be ashamed. BE ASHAMED.
I like all the consoles really o.o
Prefer PS3 though
7everybody should play super mario bros.
04i'm someone
04who likes online gaming
are you the same Malefor that came on a few years ago?
7I still play it on my bro's old GBC
who was 11?
6Randomness?
I prefer the PS3 for having it so long
04yet will only play a game like every so often
but, oh the irony, I like my vista more
04a month of membership
I'm guessing not
Only because of mods
7DDR: you played super mario crossover?
04might be spent playing a game like once or twice
and of PC games
No, I'm 11 right now.
06you tend to stab everything lol
04that's not good use of money
what else would I do?
12Ew Outlook
well not 'everything' :p
exaactly >_>
but my company uses it
so I ahve no choice
7... super mario crossover. google it. it's on newgrounds
12Same here
04now the wii and the ps3 = free internet play
7is epic win
I'm 15 now don't mean I'm any les creepy.
oh
not to mention it's the 2007 version
04so yeah
which just plains ucks
7mega man is the best character
*sucks
Anyone watched E3?
I'll check it out some time
04E3?
I, did not
04oh
04no
7DO EET NAO
I was too busy playing with meshes
LOL
06oh look arti is back
Haha, I watched Microsoft, Nintendo's, and Sony's.
I can't chat, play Pokemon, AND play a mario game
06after a long arguement so conveniently missed :>
06anyways
XD
04funny enough even though the wii has the least good games
04i think i like the wii more
06I've gotten like....a quarter of my work for this week done
06and I've been at it for 3 hours
04only because 360 you have to pay for internet play
the wii has some good games
but I shall try anyway
and some games that arent needed
06not to mention something I missed last week ._.
04and i have had personal bad terms with sony
XD
3DS seems interesting, but it's quite annoying, because you can't really tell what it's like without seeing it in person.
06and what's horribly sad
06I think I'm going to get the highest grade in the class by default
04like the fact i broke 2 PS2s
04by doing nothing
06because a week later, people are STILL asking stupid questions that basically ensure they've failed the class
Most people have a wii, if they have any modern console, but people never seem to use them.
I still have my PS2, and it still works. :)
???
LOL
04lol Okami
the big one
ahahahah some Mac fanboy's gonna love this
"Severe Thunder Storm Warnings for southeastern Michigan. Stay in doors if you can, away from windows."
04is a very good reason to have a Wii
06and yet I STILL have to suffer through this
"But I already DO stay away from Wndows!"
*Windows
06....LOL
now I had the small one for a few years :p
/me pokes Quilava
that is annoying how you have to jump with z...
I'm bored.
PlayStation Move looks quite interesting, but a lot like a black wiimote with a flashing light bobble on top.
yes?
JK
The major thing I like about PS Move is that it has basically a wiimote and nunchuck, expect the two are wireless.
I've always wanted a wireless wiimote/nunchuck setup, wired is too awkward.
6o.o
)_(
I like the wired setup.
But at one point during Microsoft's conference, part of me died inside.
7DDR: you can change the controls
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va-NXzhciVM
To me, a wireless setup would be awkward
oh nice
The most awkward thing ever.
7ah. pits. my nemesis
6o.o
XD
wat
:V
lol wut
microsoft + nintendogs = kinetimals
:V
The horrible bit is where the kid pretends to actually feel the virtual tiger licking her.
I'd pay to see some more... disturbing applications of that techology
xD
If she's going to do that, they should have the console spray spit at her.
"Bye Skittles I love you". My God. *Dies*
:l
7ah, warp zones, my good friends
This is boring!
skittles? sounds tasty
:\
6...
dear god that is so
stupid
ogod
04skittles
Yes....
04taste the rainbow
http://twitter.com/NMcCoy/status/16832946497
12*sigh*
Destroy the rainbow
ffff
rage I can't think ><
12I just read up all the stuff I missed while I was on the phone -v-
/me stops working
that must have been a long phone call
12Well
12It started off as a long phone call and then I fell asleep after it as well LOOOOL
XD
Nintendo had it's bad points too, mainly the horrible names that were chosen for their titles.
"Disney Epic Mickey"
So you read the stuff that went on after you were on the phone and had a small nap XD
"Kirby Epic Yarn"
12Yeh but it was easier to say the first thing XD
indeed
06fell asleep lmao
6Yes what?
blah disney
they killed my childhood
06I slept for 11 hous last night
06feels SO good
12I was absolutely shattered
12Lolz
7fucking bullet bills
12I cant remember the last time I slept THAT long!
06but waking up was like "heck no, go away sun"
7megaman is too tall
06my record is 15 hours
Oh, Microsoft stole some stuff from Nintendo too, there was Kinect Sports.
12Hmm lets see
06that was after a new years "stay-uo-for-50-hours" thing
06*up
04nintendo
12I went to bed at 9pm when i got home and then woke up at 4pm the next day, which was California waking up time (8am)
04is going to be a really rich company me thinks
12My clock was entirely screwed
06lol
04lawsuits here and lawsuits there
04XD
LOL, the guy doing kinect sports was really awkward too.
06sounds like me when I traveled from California to Italy
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQZgGtMeXXU&NR=1
12XD
12Italy is an hour ahead of us so it would have been more or less the same thing
06got there at like 11am, and I was like "heck...what time IS it?"
06I was soooooooo tired
12Lol
06took me 2 days to catch up
12Aurora, Lugia is on a plane to England right now ^v^
06I was snoozing on our boat during the day, and night time was a stroll-through-town and sit on the boat
06and then I got siturated
06situated
06arti, you're what...6, 7, or 8 hours ahead of us?
06california
06well, what time is it, I can do math lol
I's bored.
128
12And er
06k
12It's 8.22 right now
06yeah I got that after you said 8 lololol
everytime I see that word I think of how in the wizard that kid pronounces it
12After years of automatically converting California time in my head, I'm still able to do it ^^
"CA-LI-FOUR-NI-AH"
o/` CALIFORNIA LOOOOOVE o/`
06I've been paying attention to like....5 time zones this past week
O
I'm messing with people on Omegle with my bot
`O'
Saw a red kite flying around over a Tesco Express on my way home today.
06korea, hawaii, my time, utah, florida, britain
06killing my brain
XD No.
why hawaii?
12The very first time I saw a red kite was when I flew to Leeds for the first time in 2008 XD
12I saw it.. and even though I'd never seen one before.. I knew exactly what it was.
12They're so distinctive
Wow.
Life.
6Indeed
/me yawns
06I saw a live chikadee for the first time just a couple weeks ago
06it was so CUTE
page is still messed-up -,-"

12Last Updated - 22/06/2010 20:43
12That is the absolute worst downtime I've seen from them so far

because they hate you
/me runs
12D:
...LOL fail, Windows XP install CD BSOD'ed
12LOL
man, I could really use some blank discs
06.....LOL
Windows 7 is physically incapable of erasing hard drives
XP CDs are awesome at that but if they use SATA you're screwed >_>
04how funny
04do you think it would of been during that animal one
04if the game froze or bluescreened in front of the little girl
I don't need to explain myself to you! :P
06SATA?
SATA.
04and she thought she killed skittles
12You sure?
it's a type of hard drive connector
yep
6Ok then.. :P
and this is the most current too
12I thought I wiped mine with an XP CD before I installed Win7
XP with SP3
LOL
XP discs don't have SATA
well
it's probably IDE :P
wut
XP discs don't know what SATA is
12No it's not..
06read that as IDIE
so it bluescreens, not finding any hard drives
06I die
o.o
04lol
is your XP CD hacked?
like bootleg?
or is it legit
12Yes
12LOL
that's why
12Of course it's hacked
12Ok
most of the bootleg ones put SATA drivers in for you
12Didnh't think it was modified like that though but must be
this is a company, we don't use bootlegs LOL
*official* XP CDs, otoh
nope, it is
12Oh yeh
I'd totally use DBAN if I could
Yeah, or if the skipping rope decapitated 'Skittles'.
just no way to burn it >_>
I should bring in a few blank discs tomorrow XD
04lol
12I'm actually surprised to hear you can't install XP on a sata drive..
04if the park ranger came and arrested her
04XD
12Ovo
Looooooool
you CAN, you just need drivers from a floppy disk
and th ese computers have no floppy drives
so eh
12Ewww
eww what
12Floppy disk drives
04better yet
04if in game
04a hunter came and shot skittles for his pelt
04XD
12I've never ever had to use one in my life :D
04then started skinning him in front of her
why ew?
Floof has arrived!
Floppy disks are cool XD
I've used them a lot
04!floof
12I hate them
not anymore, as they're outdated
but useful for vintage stuff
eh, why?
12Because I don't do vintage maybe....?
12It's just old trash to me
orly
LOL fail
12o-o

04i'm
12and why waste the time installing it? XD

/me never steps foot there anymore :3

03I has a bunch of those
12I had a Windows 3.1 computer for about a year and a half.. but it had no internet and I just used it for MS paint and QBasic
06I was using a computer for games at 4
"Just insert your floppy disk"
03One has a virus on it. :3

I remember wanting a ZIP drive so badly
"It's like a floppy disk... but it holds 100MB!"
12LOL
06....LOL

o.o
/me goes to make some toast
blarg
/me nibbles people
06ugh o-o;;;;;
06discovered my mysterygift
o.o what
06drf would enjoy hammering it
an iPod?
06macbook pro
EW
wait
what for?
06my birthday i guess
so mystery as in your parents just bought it for you
?
06yeah
OK
so here's what you do
sell the macbook
06lol
buy a really powerful real computer with money
seriously, those things cost like $1500
You could get a beastly laptop that'll pwn most desktops for that
like my MSI :)
or just tell your parents you don't want it and would prefer to pick out your own laptop with that money
06too late for that option
06it shipped from china to alaska, and it apparently on route to my stepmom's work now
o.o
06at this point, after working weeks with macs
you can't just go to an Apple store and ask for a refun?
*d
06my problems were the mouse, the keyboard, and the fact my programs would be limited
06I don't want to do that, in a way I still want it lol
why?
even if you put Windows on it, the hardware still sucks
06explaining it to you? difficult LOL
12BACK LOL
06and I'm not entirely sure
no but why would you possibly want a Mac?
wb
06the BEST way to say it is that my parents just bought me a laptop without me even hinting I wanted it
12I made a soup dish that my dad used to make for me :> sorta half Chinese, half Italian style
06I'm not about to turn around and say no
06I'm going to take it and use it
2bah
12DRF
use it to test your hammers with?
12Sentimental value
what
XD
well
12Like
12We sold our Wii, but I didn't sell SSBB because it was a gift from Nick XD
12I can't play it XD it just sits there
12XD
and I'll be liket his and this
06parents always say that, drf
so they just return it and give me the money
they don't mind XD
06but 99% of the time I accept it anyways
and I take them up on the offer
well make this that 1% :O
06not really
unless you like being a mac using n00b
06hey
06I'm not you ok
12No some people just don't like returning gifts
06I don't care about apple that much
what about selling gifts?
/me runs
06but I'm not purely 100% anti-apple
but if you can get something way better for the same price... why not?
06I prefer PC, but I'm not going to hate on something I really don't have that strong of an opinion on
06what's considered way better
um
12Because she'd have to basically say to her parents "I don;t like your gift, Im getting something better"
at least twice as powerful
06considering I'm not as big a computer nerd as some people
12DRF
what
06it's not even that horrible
12My mum bought me the most horrible dress once XD I would never in a million years wear it but I dont want to give it up
06to me, at least
not to mention the most important thing: a working mouse
where you can right click
12It was the thought that counted and I can't give away things that people give me ^^
LOL
well I can
06I have my tablet for that
06I haven't used a mouse in forever
does your tablet even work on a Mac?
/me runs
12Some people are different
06yes
12LMAO
06it does actually
XD
well
at least put Windows on that thing
if you're gonna keep it -_-
06which I'll have to do
06Paint Sai wont work otherwise
but I mean
XD
well
Yeah, you could put Windows on it
o3o
just going "I don't want it" is one thing
telling your parents you can get something better, on the other hand
isn't that bad IMO
12I'd feel horrible and my parents would too
12:>
06lol if you knew me, that's the HARDEST thing for me to ay
06say
12I know exactly what you mean Aurora
like seriously, you could get a laptop like my MSI for the same price as a macbook, and I guarantee you it's more powerful than your average desktop
06becaus ei know how my parents would feel, yeh
06they were actually REALLY excited about this
so do it behind their backs?
/me runs
06they had fun keeping it a surprise, and they were all so excited
I've seen HP laptops that look really similar to Macbooks for those retards who actually think Macbooks look cool
06excet the apple
06which is very noticable
yeah
06if my computer suddenly lacks an apple
not if you're not looking for it though
XD
06I know for a fact my parents would o-o
well
get one of those little skins for it
that covers the log
o
/me hides
12DRF come on
12She wants to keep it :>
12Let her
06hey, let him argue about it lol
06not going to change my decision
06:P
12XD
fine, I'll let you suffer with it, whatever
12¬¬
06I mainly hated those stupid mouses, and the stupid keyboard
06both of which I wont be dealing with
do me a favor though, install Windows and try deleting Mac OSX with it, see what happens
/me runs
I've always wanted to try that XD
06imo, macbook pro keyboards are better than the flat craps I used before
12LOL
except for the lack of a numpad
bah
which is like the single most useful thing on a keyboard
besides the letters o.o
but ew top row numbers
06which to this day I don't even know what it is LOL
LOL fail
06never used it
you must not type numbers a lot then o.o
12Hey DRF, wtf is the point in making a macbook with OSX if you can install Windows XP on it anyway?
12It's like.. why not just get an XP laptop? LOL
06then again, I've been living with a laptop that lacks the right-hand numbers
because Apple is that stupid?
12Yeh
06I ONLY use the top numbers
LOL
well
06that's all it has
my friends have laptops with no numpads
and it drives me crazy
06which sucks for alt-number commands
I'm like GAAAAAH WHERE ARE THE NUMBERS
exactly
06well
12I have one of those, it annoys me too
06I'm not you
that too :P
I have a laptop with no numpad either, I hate it
06you're not me
06that makes us both happy
/me runs
LOL
12But only since I started my job funnily enough, I used to be a top number user before that
my 15.4" MSI has a full numpad
where most similarly sized laptops don't
12Then I realised that I NEEDED the numpad for work
XD
I've used the numpad as long as I could remember
and LOL Arti, XP laptop... that's so outdated
/me runs
12LOL
12You know what?
what
nah, I have no problem with XP, but I'd prefer 7 XD
12The numpad light used to annoy me so I'd make sure it was always off XD
I'm using Xp right now, since this computer is from 2003
06I'm on XP, no problems
12Now I don't even notice it
but like
this thing sucks
the DVD burner
06except the zombie virus that's been lurking on it
burns at 1x speed
it's gonna take me like an hour and a half
12HAHA
to burn one DVD
>_>
it's not my computer, it's my work's
they just let me use this XD
/me tackles Articuno
12At least you'll get a longer lasting DVD with it
though I'm actually impressed how good it is for being so old
/me explodes!
what?
14^v^
Germany won!
burning at 4 or 8x makes it last just as long
12Nah
not to mention the stupid disc has scratches all over it
12Well
I found it on a shelf LOL
only disc I could find
They did? :D
EW SOCCER
yeah
1:0
06football yes!
EW BOTH KINDS OF FOOTBALL
you don't like sports in general
so shush you XD
06ok, pigskinball is only fun during the superbowl
12and you know we're playing you on Sunday..?
Ghana
OH THAT'S JUST GREAT
06and football....I like playing it, and it can be fun to watch
"DVD media error"
12LOL Ghana
and it stopped burning
DL:
*D:
see, you just can't burn at 0.7x and expect it to work
12LOL
"Is it live or is it Memorex?" It's DEFECTIVE is what it is :@
well whatever, this hard drive will take a while to format anyway so I can just burn the Windows 7 disc at home
03D:
using a good burner XD
I must say, though
06wow...
06I can't explain how happy I feel right now
I'm impressed that this computer from March 2003 has a 2.8GHz dual core and 2GB of RAM
that's actually really good
06my stepmom gave me the approval to drop this stupid summer class
for a second I read that as stupid laptop
/me runs
06I'm sitting here with about 20 tabs open for the class, realizing I could close them all
06hey, a mac with windows as well
06tbh, that's a good deal
06both OSs on it
06and I can't think of anything I'd need to run with so much power that my computer wouldn't handle it
like, say, a video editing program?
/me hides
12I HATE that TST is down v_v I miss it
06I'm gonna go on a limb here, but don't macs HAVE video editing programs?
06or if you're talking about my current one, 1) my laptop is old as heck, 2) my other computer is old as well, and supports files for 6 people, and 3) I'm not as competent as you in computer knowledge
12Not very good ones to be fair
06heck I don't even USE video editing anymore
12Infact Mac only do graphic editing programs good
and by good she means average at best
/me runs
and layouting
seriously, there's really nothing you can do on OSX that you can't do in Windwos -_-
*Windows
you can even use like, Adobe crap on Windows
and yes, *crap*
06Again
12No, most professional graphic editing businesses use macs
it's bloated as frick on any OS
06I've been offerend a mac
06not a windows
Articuno, that's because they don't know better XD
Like
06the mac will RUN a windows
my orthodontist's office uses Macs
06I will be going into the art field, which again, USES MACS
are you gonna tell me taht Macs work better for fixing teeth?
06so
06why not
/me erases that last question
No, they're just stupid and don't know how to use a proper computer
so they buy Macs
14o.o
06no, you're just being stubborn, as usual
no, all I'm saying is
why run OSX
06but again
just put Windows on it
06I don't care
and only use that
:P
06what's happened has happened
06I'm not going to whine, complain, and go around my parents' gift just because someone else thinks it's stupid
06and I personally don't have any oposing thought
I'm just saying, don't bother with OSX
just put Windows on there and use that
o.o
04lol
12OSX is a pain in the DHsajkfhsf for networking ¬¬
04confusion ftw
06I'll have both, that's that
it's a pain for *everything*
you can't even do a simple printscreen LOL
owo;;
without pressing like 3 keys
12Oh I know -v-
get this
I found this iTunes decrypter for iTunes 9 that was Mac only
so I tried it on a Mac
and it didn't work
>_>
12and you can crash it by doing 9999999999999 x 99999999999 on the calc (or you could.. but they may have fixed that because it didnt work the last time i tried XD)
LOL nice
I need to try that
did I show you that one demotivator I made?
12Dont remember
lemme find it XD
XD
I didn't find that yet
but
http://pics.blameitonthevoices.com/022010/ipad_vs_notebook.jpg
12LOL
12Seen it XD
12But never fails to make me laugh
yep
I hvae way too many links on facebook LOL
still looking
12LOL at the quote at the bottom, only just noticed that
12Wtf is that man thinking?
06lol
he's not, that's the thing
hihi
12LOL
12Hi ^v^
Arti, did you see the video of the iPhone 4 epically failing in front of millions of people?
:D
12Sorry but the only thing he's done right is rip off stupid people
Yep
12I haven't seen it but I've heard about it loads of times
06tbh, as funny as that is, I don't see why that was all his fault
12Infact I'll go watch it now
why what was, Aurora?
06the phone not connecting
well
it wasn't, but
if you watch later on
he's all "Everybody turn off your computers and put them on the ground so my phone will work"
that's just retarded
if you can't use the iPhone with someone else on the network, wtf is the pint
*point
06ok yeah, that part was...stupid (lack of a better word)
:P
12What the hell?
12Was he being serious?
and it's also his fault for designing the thing
Yep
dead serious
06everyone did it lol
12.....
12How?
because he's STUPID
Skittles. D:
that's why
12How can you NOT use a phone with computers?
12Lol
well
he thought the network was being overloaded by too many people using it
Not want.
12Oh right XD
12LOL
in reality the phone just plain sucks as all other Apple products to
*do
and that's why it wasn't connecting
XD
06while I don't have much opinion on the macbook....I'm so far against iPhones I could be related to drf
/me runs
12I like how the first thing he mentions is how it "looks" of course
12and how beautiful it is -v-
yeah
12Wow he goes on about that for AGES
Well I admit the Macbook can be decent if you put Windows on it
it's just OSX = fail, overpriced hardware = fail, lack of proper right click = fail, combine those and it's 3x fail
12Only because it's light XD
well that too
then again my MSI isn't too heavy
06proper right click doesn't apply to me
like 6 pounds
06I have means of it
Macbooks are what, 5?
LOL
06so in your terms, it's only 2xs fail
HERE I FOUND IT
http://img5.imageshack.us/img5/3479/poster41329557.jpg
THIS
06and since I'm not paying
061xs fail
12I dont get whats so amazing about REALLY thin phones.. they're so delicate
06and since I'll be getting wondows os as well
/me runs
seriously though, try erasing OSX with Windows
see what happens
XD
06you go do it yourself
06I don't care 8D
on what computer?
06find one
i don't get the point of phones with massive screens
LOL
well
my Droid is cool
they're asking to be scratched
12Yeh droid for the win
06they're everywhere, so it shouldnt be hard
Woo. England is playing Germany in a round-of-16 game on Sunday. Awesome.
that's why you get a screen protector LOL
^
although all my friends have htc desires now
Aurora, but 99% of Macbook users are stupid and LIKE OSX
06hey, my blackberry, while old, is still awesome
XD
well
I've never really cared for Blackberry
06I'm the 1% that doesn't care either way then
I don't HATE them like I do iphones
I just don't like the tiny keyboards XD
06mine's a pearl, so even SMALLER keyboards ftw
Speaking of which my company is throwing out like 20 old Blackberries

which is awesome
XD
12LOL VERIZON

12I heard it just then
the speakers here suck so I don't really care

06I can't tell if my withdrawl from the class went through

06Articuno, your art was what first led me to the site, what first brought me to DA, and first made me realize that I could expand my art talent
06because of that, it gave me a life goal, and you've always been an idol (and soon after, a friend)
06I can't bear to watch my idol and great friend give up on something she loved doing for so long

12i read that as phone went away x-x
14How are you hun? ^^
12What speech?
12Hang on I'll read up LOL
Arti's art inspired many people, to pick the ball from earlier again :)
12Awww.. well..
03well, they basically just gotta buy a new mirror for the SUV
12Aurora you've out done me, you don't need me now XD
/me runs
12You're a much better artist than I could ever be, I just don't have the time to dedicate to it
06what ARE you talking about, you peadge
12But even then I always hated that I couldn't draw details and you can :>
12Thats what makes a better artist
06you don't need that much time. what I'm doing is for my career
06that's my life
03Good artists create, great artists steal
/me runs
06but you can still do it for your enjoyment
12Not really.
12It's not that fun anymore
12Because i can't draw what I want to draw
06because you don't think you can D:
06...
06that
06which is why you can't D:
12Not bad. XD You?
12I always used to believe I was the best Lugia artist in the world, but then I started struggling to draw it and only after many months of that did I start to think "I suck."
14I'm good :>
12It's nothing to do with my mindset, it's just me
12Yay :3
12I'm not really an artist D:
12I'm a cartoonist
12and Lugia became too complicated for me
06complicated D:
06well
06you have something I don't
06your style is so recognizeable
12LOL
06I can see a picture of lugia done by you without any info, and know immediately it was you
12Everyone has that
12They just can't see it themselves
06not really
12I can see your style
06true I can't see my own
06but when yours is dead recognizeable, AND consistent
06mine's not consistant
12I once made a journal saying "Do I have a style?"
06yes you do
12Omg but
12Dunno how you can call this consitant
03that seriously looks like Nintendo promo art
06your coloring style for one
03I didn't realize you drew that XD
12Two completely different styles there
06and you always draw beaks the same way
03take that as a compliment
12See?
06and feathers
06I can tell its yours
06drf is just not art-attuned
03XD
12I can tell your art is yours too believe me
06ok well, that aside
03oh btw
03Articuno
03want to do me a Photoshop favor?
Heya!
03inb4 no
06you have a distinct style, and one of the most well known lugia artists out there
06if not THE artist
12I was one of the most well known, but I haven't drawn Lugia since last year Ovo
03anyway
03Articuno
06doesn't mater
12You're the top Lugia artist to me
06people still know you
03without hurting the rest
03think that's possible?
/me hugs ^^
12People know the old me
12Errrrr
12Easily
06we know you as a person, so we know what you're going through
still I wait for at least a 2-minute-pencil-sketch done by you Arti^^
03that's why I asked if you could do it
12Just go over all that part in black
/me runs
06but for those on DA, they STILL know you
03wait
03but
03I like the stars
03behind it
03:?
03*:/
12Hold on
03k
03:)
06drf, it's not hard to redraw stars LOL
Articuno?
Do you have these logs?
@_o
12Hm?

12Sorry I thought I sent them
12D:
No
12Gimme a sec
Okies

06arti you wanna know where I learned to draw lugia for the first several months?
12The movie lol
06by drawing from your art LOL
http://fukung.net/v/8459/beaefcabab7acd01572fe4b73a172ce2.gif
03<Aurora> drf, it's not hard to redraw stars LOL <-- I suck at art, is the thing
06the movie came later, when I felt horrible referencing your art
06drf....take a mouse
03LOL
06white pen tool
03you wanna do it for me then?
/me runs
06and click a dot in the black
06sure
03that's like me telling you
06it's not that hard LOL
03that reformatting a PC is easy
03it is to me
03but you'd be like WTF
06ok then,we uderstand each other :>
03I admit to knowing nothing about art short of like copy and paste into Paint
/me will do that
03and save
03I do that all the time XD
03and cropping. I can do that too
......
12Well, you can't reference from my art anymore, just look at the latest piece I did LOL
Articuno x.x
Holy crap
06arti, you gotta not be so down on yourself
12When it takes you about 100 tries to make a HALF decent Lugia..
12It kinda gets you down
If you're not enjoying it, just take a break for a bit?
12I have been
12About half a year break
12and then I made a piece of crap and now I'm sad again
12Because I actually really WANT to be able to draw how I used to
I thought you always claimed those drawings were bad though
/me cough]
12No i'm proud of most of them
06perhaps go reference form the video a bit then?
12Like the Soul Silver one, the Wave watchinfg one
12a few others
06and drf
06http://img256.imageshack.us/img256/6813/drfbanneredit.png

03if I knew the font I'd retype it XD
12This
12Is the only pic I am almost 100% proud of
03I acutally don't like that one as much as some of your old one
03s
12I even made it into a poster for my bedroom wall and it's my wallpaper at work
/me adds her name to the biggest lugia fans in that description
/me then runs
06lol
03XD
03that one's alright

12I copied that off the movie
03somehow the comical ones look better to me than the "realistic" ones
03yeah but it was cool :)
12Yeh but it wasn't my own pose
12i just traced it off the movie
03I don't care
12And it wasn't even my background either
03that's like saying photographers suck for not having their own poses when they take a picture of you
03that's dumb
03well w/e
12Um no
12Tracing is DIFFERENT to taking photos
03I honestly don't care, I think the final result is all that matters LOL
03wait wtf

12YES I SAID I DDI

03er
03see, I really like the old style
03than that
03the 'realistic' ones just look weird to me
03and funnily enough
03I like the old photos of you too
12It's not realistic, it's the same style of colouring as the movie posters....

03no, it looks more realistic yeah

hey does anyone know who the produsers r of the spyro movie o where...
Seriously?
XD
yep
fail
I even told him on SC that I was a girl
yeah even though we corrected him ourselves
yeah
In reply to your insults over my intelligence, I have already been told this, and I do in fact already know.
Because it doesn't matter...
Have a splendid day, and next time try not to insult others out in the open.
^ He admits you told him but still gets itm wrong
XD
Lol fail
it's kind of funny
the forum is in complete chaos with no mods around
hahaha, yeah
look at sr's post
Proof that anarchy wouldn't work
Haha, perfect
we should show spyroforum to Nate
hi, thanks
we're not going to purosely wreck havoc on here now are we? :|
np
No
Or at least, I'm not
me neither
But I'm not going to make any effort to stop anyone who wants to either :P
..what?
oh wait
for a second I didn't read the "if"
I'd just sit back and lol as all the members leave
lyon: you have only morrowind right?
...kind of what I was meaning :P
I know
I was agreeing
Yeah
just for being athiest
I can totally see it right now
And he'd edit everyone's posts and fix the chatspeak and typos
XD
Because he has OCD!!!!
A Missionary grammar nazi
yeah remember when he said that he would if he was a mod??
uggggh
Bored.
03XD cool

03and png
/me hides
Ok.
i cant believe the movie was canceled! spyro is my life and im only 11. i got a pro artist to paint him just for me, ive got a screen saver for my phone, pictures, and even huge posters!
and I hate his blue font and how he always pushes the enter key in the middle of his posts to make it look "neater" when it's really just SO [censored]ING ANNOYING I WANT TO [censored]ING KICK A BABY IN THE WANG GRDUGDLRHR
so
pretty much
Haha
:D
I know what you mean about the enter thing
I read it like there's a random break in the middle of his sentences
or like he's trying to write poetry with his posts
*rawr*
I'm in Calculus again
Did you see that some member left because they're sick of religion and dragons being brought up everywhere?
it just screams GAAAAAY to me
yeah I did
It was Starscream or something
I don't blame them
they were mad because the topic would go from dragons /to/ religion
o.o
or I think that's what they were trying to say
Nala!!!!!!!!!!! :D
Oh yeah, maybe
One moment, gotta do a quiz
=]
I didn't read it very carefully
zI honestly didn't mind all the religious discussions as long as they didn't go crazy about it
I don't either
people just need to be open to the fact that their beliefs aren't the only ones
that annoyed me\
I don't get why it's such a big deal that people talk about religion
It doesn't even annoy me that much when they bring it into everything
it's like, I consider my religion to be part of who I am, why can't I mention it
Because that's just part of who they are
Exactly
im gonna call the peeps who tried to make this movie and im gonna give them a piece of my mind!!!!!!!!
my beliefs change every day
It's the same with atheism; I'm not atheist, but I don't care if people want to talk about being atheist all the time
same here
so I don't understand how people get so mad when another person has a different religion
Yeah, it's stupid
so idk why they all get so fried
I just look at atheism as another religion really
04Brother: Yes, I only have Morrowind
If you're comfortable with your own religion, it shouldn't bother you that other people have different ones than you
exactly
Getting upset about things like that tells me you're insecure
Might not be the case, but that's how I tend to interpret it
And on the other side, Raidon Makoto and Fletch_Talon
yeah
he's a bit over obsessed with his atheism
it irritates me
yeah he is
Good?
I think it's because they feel more comfortable being like that onlinen
I mean really there's no reason to insult people in that way about it
for what system?
maybe there are a lot more people who are like that in real life, but they're just afraid to show it
03hm
03looks alright, but for some reason the letters look weird
03for the green text on top
and then they go online and they're a bunch of over obsessed reliious folk
this kind of reminds me of a thread on another forum
what was it about?
Basically this person is getting angry because no one accepts her Buddhism
ah
TS?
Yet she doesn't even want to read about other religions when it's assigned in school
No, GTS+
ah, I see
heh
I've been hanging around there lately
I don't get that
that reminds me of something that Spyro22 said, he said he failed his religion class because "it's so hard because he's not the other religions"
I love learning about other religions
So now one of the mods is arguing with people in the thread
it's like, you don't have to be that religion to learn about other religions
"YOU'RE FIRED, GET OUT OF MY DAMN OFFICE!"
It's kind of entertaining to watch
03check that though
03I think that looks good
http://forums.gtsplus.net/index.php?showtopic=38684
Ok.
03yours was good but the text got kinda weird
03so w/e
Blueflame == me if you didn't figure that out :P
Oh yeah, I see what you mean.
wow
nice post
I love when somebody comes in and tells the OP exactly how it is
03thanks for the effort though
Also, click my eggs plz
:P
03and I gotta run an errand, bbl
and thanks
:P
the dragon ones?
yeah
But yeah, Reyo has pretty much taken the debate now
I don't know him, but he seems awesome
argh, too many long posts.
I didn't read all of them either

/me wonders how to edit .class files :3
lol youtube wouldn't need more regulations than it already has...
also LOL wut
/me no idea :S
03:5
032:
looks like our host messed-up the PHP module or something like that
I made a test PHP document with only this content:
<?php
phpinfo( );
?>
and THAT's what the server responds to it
http://www.lugia.us/phpinfo.php
03o.o
therefore: Module fail
but yet my cgiproxy makes the site work :)
oh?
show me
Hey everyone
hrm - looks like a translation error then
dunno
I just discovered that last night
so I'm telling people to use it
Lol, you can edit anything with notepad! XD
maybe it's a compressed stream
hm
well the forums actually work fine at my house
just nobody else was able to get on
so i tried it with my proxy, and bingo
apparently sometime last night the main site started working too
03lolnotepad :3
....
those pieces of idiotic fools. They really messed-up the config of the server. It delivers the pages compressed and your proxy does nothing but unpack the stream again
just what a proxy would do
oh
so can you unpack it besides using a proxy?
I'm curious, though, why I'm able to use the forum at my house then... without a proxy
Only pieces of idiotic fools? Not whole ones?
LOL
I guess you already cut them up in your anger. :o
that would give me a reason to think about. Meaning: Someone's within your data stream already and reading + unpackig it
that's still optional
what's still optional
unpacking the data?
nope, cutting the host's staff into pieces
speaking of idiotic fools
http://cheezfailbooking.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/funny-facebook-making-sence.png?w=225&h=319
oh.
Hi
plus - the fools are REALLY crazy oO
take a look at the config
/me goes to feed tokey and smokey
/me sighs...
o
lol
hi LL
the caveman editing tool
they installed litespeed without implementing threat safety or even activating the packager function on php
but then again if you know what you're doing = rocket science
/me hides
notepad does it all
12hai...
therefore - all the contents are transmitted via bzip-compression, but the php module has no idea about it. Therefore no browser understands it and receives these data-farts we get if we jump onto the page directly
I tried editing an image with notepad once, didn't end well. :o
that also explains why static pages are NOT affected (see www.lugia.us/index.htm for instance)
hm
well
yeah programs, images and music files don't usually work well xD
I find it annoying the PS always associates itself with PHP files.
that*
I hate programs that assume it's OK to steal all file associations

The code was just supposed to check the first 4 letters of the data coming from the socket for "PING", but it wasn't working because I had it return the characters from 0-4, which is 5 characters, not 4, so it returned "PING ", and I couldn't tell the difference between them in the output panel.

04To dream of your own death, indicates a transitional phase in your life. You are becoming more enlightened or spiritual. Alternatively, you are trying desperately to escape the demands of your daily life.

*level
04plus i look at their summoner skills in pregame
6Yeah
6I wanted to go like hell and the band I really wanted to see is about to finish I think..
04this was why i wanted to get summoner level 14 last night XD
0413 is my unlucky number :P
12bbl everyone
12xD
oh
14:< k
04kk azure
04Quilava i think one time
04they actually walked over one of teemo's traps
04and didn't set it off
the only level i hate is Dantes Freezer
glitch
14http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwA7OW0nRcQ&feature=related <-- Nalex is gonna spazz when she sees this .3.
04i put the trap behind me because that's how i like to escape sometimes, run away and let them get hit by the trap
04they went around to try to gank me which they went right over the trap without setting it off
6I hate that level too..
12tis Xai
12XD
oh
I was close enough
XD
actually that happened to me once, but with Ashes arrow.
7I love the Freezer. I only dislike the canon bits
6Munitions Forge pwns
went straight through me
04lol
04you don't complain when it happens to you though
and for that drf gets a raise :O
then they spent the rest of the game bitching that we hack
/me hides
amen
so does Convexity
6Indeed
tall plains is pretty though cause of the sky
6Crap.
04i'm a bit confused
14Yes, but I cba
well my cannonball wasn't killing anyone I hit with it. even if their HP dropped to 0
04they removed one of ashe's abilities
04and made hawkshot
I successfully 'killed' 2 people like that.
6I loved that level in the beginning but now I kinda dislike it..
which ability?
14whut.
oh
6It reminds slightly of the Freezer..
lol
14@J
they just added the hawk as activated ability...
14This song hurts my ears sung by this lady D:
6The boss is pretty awesome
the passive ability is the same as before
D:<
ok
whoops
I was scrolled up
04yeah
04i forgot what the ability was called before
whats the active?
04basically you have a hawk that plays as a scout now
LOL fail
04lol Veigar
04they changed the heck out of him
sounds.. even more overpowered
14Ewewewewwewew
14Chemicalperfumesmell stuff x-x
6Shizzle.It's till 11:30.. >.<

6Well,on the second bit of the battle..
6Lolz
r u all girls
6I am
mee too
Yes...
7oh god
cool so whats the age limit in here
7it's one of them
dang......... im only 11
6Are you new here?
yes i surf the web trying to get info on the movie spyro and i came here and relized it was canceld i was so sad
6EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK
6Ah
6Welcome :P
i love spyro hes my life i have a sceen saver of him!
6iFail
y the crap did u log of then on again
There's an iFail?
6I accidently refreshed the page..-.-
7C7: uDo
raaaaaaaaaar
what do peeps do in here other than talk
Complain.
7mess with bots before SR bans them
i heard something about a game called spyro the darkest hour
Nala: How's you?
6That came 1,5 years ago
it already came out
6And was re-named TLoS Dawn of the Dragon
oh well that was the first spyro game i played ever and then i herd of the origonal sieres y do peeps like it better
7it's funner. more fantasmical
04sigh
04i hate this game
so what u can fly in dawn of the dagon and the graphics r amazing
i probably shouldve made a name up instead of using my real one
7right, but graphics a game does not make. You should not base your entire opinion of the game on the graphics. Base it on how much fun you're having
exactly but ive nevr playd anyothers ecept eternal night
/me sits next to Nala
6I think Eternal Night was the best of the TLoS..
7I hate TEN
We got no food, we got no jobs, our pets /heads/ are fallin' off!!!!
.-.
woot
jim carry
then don't play?
13!Espeon
find a happy place, find a happy place, find a happy place
04there is nothing else for me to play
whos TEN?
The eternal night
04i just wish for once
04that i could find a game that i actually feel confident at
play 1D tetris
04instead of a game that i practice at for over a year and never get better
oh. it easnt that much fun evn though i havent finshed it
its really REALLY hard to be bad at
04trust me i'll find a way
probably the negative reinforcement
04negative reinforcement?
I havent gotten around to trying DotD
he means: look at everythings bad sides and whining about it will definitly NOT help you :/
04i guess you can say that, it's called karma
you saying that you suck
04i must of been hitler in a past life or something
you know, that you can change your karma, right? :P
04by doing good things?
04that's not in my nature 8D
whats dotd
no... by practicing - learning of mistakes and ask for advice rather then constant whinig about bad luck :P
04bad luck is the only plausable explanation
Dawn of the Dragon.
i have proven you wrong on the "bad luck" part already... but you only see what you WANT to see :(
so... what you call "karma" is just what you make of it
04what proof?
metronom battle...
04i lost more matches than you in metronome battles lol
04it was very close to 50/50 though
u should its the best game ecept spyro,cynder, and ignitus dies but ignitus turns into the chroniclor
thats called "statistic" not bad luck :P
04statistics is luck
04or rather statistics is how luck is measured
12Back for now
7they don't die
04wb
12Ty
04i swear that shaco was a hacker
have u seen the ending cutscene? they give ther life to save the world then in
04he had a godlike by like level 8
7have you seen the epilogue cutscene?
7always watch the credits
04maybe earlier
epilogue? thers a show after the credits in dotd
04and of course i had to argue with my team-mates again that it was a lost match within the first 5 minutes of the match after shaco was decently fed
12blarg
7they're just flying about in some trees
7though how they survived defies all logic
04by the time i could even call out a surrender, they were already beating at the nexus
6Lol.
hi
wb
hey

Yes but I stopped visiting them after they turned so political
SR i dont understand who ember and flame r in the spyro games
They don't really add anything to the game, just filler characters.
o
They're from the old Spyro games, not TLoS.
on youtube thers all this stuff on ember liking spyro
Ember is from A Hero's Tail
and she did like spyro in that game.
whats ALL this dak spyro stuff? is it when he gets mad
Lol, I think some troll is trying is piss off SR, I mean what 11 year-old talks about politics, but types as a 5 year-old speaks?
Its a new form spyro takes on that gives him increased abilities.
Meow
I'm gonna go eat soon

those were the WORST literature-related shocks I've ever experienced
woah, a country :O
hello
(?w?)
thats such a name for a story
like Eclipse or Breaking Dawn
and... first of all, half the class takes a look at the first illustration of the main two characters talking, who are a 40-year old man and a Middle Schooler
and thinks "whoa BL"
LOLPEDO
inb4 pedophile?
/me dies
so they laugh at that
I think even..well yeah drf's class would laugh at that
and later, the teacher asks, "What do you think Zebra wants to do with Mr. Wilson?" meaning, "What do you think that he wants to say by drawing a helicopter for the class"
aaaand everyone laughs at that
for... several minutes
LOL
LOL
LOL
LOL
/me runs
and I didn't get it until they drew a whole PAIRING MAP on the whiteboard during break
grow up
/me hides
that reminds me of one joke George Carlin made
BUT I cant say it
I am over 2500 years old (??` ``)
orly
well drf is OVER 9000
LOL
he's actually 9002 but we dont mention that :P
/me hides
I mean IRL FFS
I don't care how old your imaginary dragon is >_>

04sigh
04the thing that irritates me most about the game besides the people
04is how random the selection is
hey spyro rocks i so ur forum account
GUYS I DID IT I FILMED THE COVER OF EVERY CD I HAVE XD
I think I'm missing a stack though I don't remember seeing one of my placebo's and one of my chiodos' but it's possible I did get it and just didn't notice

Consider yourself warned as to the rest of the site. :P
04i should savethis page for eXAR
04....darnit what's the letter i'm missing
04i always forget how to spell it XD
Evening everyone.
12how goes
Al goes well
All*
12i see
So how did you like ace attorney?
12i'm just messing with my funny deck
:o
12i already beat it
look it me
hey :D
I know
12took me an entire day to beat the 5th episode XD
hehe
12but it was fun as heck
heyz everyone
I was asking if you liked it overall compared to the rest
That's all
I might go back and beat it one day, but I've set that game aside for now
03o/` eat it, eat it, get yourself and egg and beat it o/`
Is that a weird al spoof of beat it?
03Yes?
12this deck i made is so funny XD
03you haven't heard it?
Feeling any better?
No?
03LOL
03it's a classic
I didn't know it existed?
03from like 1984
03look it up sometime
03one of my favorite Weird Al songs
I will
03k
03:P
Eventually
03I made a video on YouTube too, showing how similar it is to the original
03using the track from Guitar Hero
03of Beat It
03and just changing the audio
I already looked up fat just two weeks ago
The song
03XD
Slash spoof
12the strategy
03no, it's a parody of Bad
03that one's alright, but I like Eat It better
12basically get 4 kingdra prime out turn 1
Indeed it is
...
12and with expert belt and hit for 120 XD
O_O
12problem though is that it autoloses to spiritomb
12the build for this deck is funny as heck
Why not add the psudo gust of wind cards to counter it?
I dun remember the name :p
12XD
What happens after you get the kingdra out?
12you keep spamming for 120
124 spray splash
12dragon steam
I mean, the opponent has time to prepare for a machamp at least
With
Not for
12if i come across machamp
12i just use superscoop up to scoop up a kingdra prime
12drop it down again and spraysplash a 5th time
K
12it's too hard to fit crobat into the deck
Now what about the new celebi...
07o3o
12what about celebi?
/me dies
The one that was recently announded in japan
For the new set
eh?
12the deck isn't meant to win
12it's just a funny deck
... oh
Well comical it is
*should really change nicks*
12speaking of funnydeck
12you should see the funnydeck my friend made
12dude
I remember someone using te old kingdras a few years ago
12Delbird and Feraligatr prime
Same thing :p
12you usualy lose the game for yourself turn 2
Exactly
12you attach like 14 energy to your pokemon
12then use delibird's attack to draw 14 cardsXD
Perfect deck deck
As I like to call them
Or just "deck deck"
12if you don't autowin
12you just deck yourself XD
So I went through my gatr lumin deck to find flaws and replacable cards. I found out I needed pokemon communications since I had none ( and rare candies since I only had 2 per deck ). However, NOBODY at league has any to trade.
12i wish i still had UR Donked still built XD
12basically
124 uxie
123 crobat
122 psychic energy and the rest is burn cards XD
12like drawrers and pokedex and blowers
07ohai Beto
What happened to it?
12i took it apart
Thought so
12i personally think spiritomb
12was the biggest party crasher card ever made
I agree
12i bet
12a lot of unlimited players
12have gotten really irritated with these last sets
12first they make deafen dialga
12then they make spiritomb
12the final straw was turning bill into a supporter
12they wrecked unlimited
XD
Eh
I'd still play either way
oh, oops i blind, i feeling a lil better
heh
that's good
twiching more tho
12lol
:(
12i should just play that silly feraligatr delibird deck
12for the entire season this year
12i lost hope in the game after they announced the rotation
12they basically took my fears from last year
night all
12and made them the reality of this year
12if you can find a decent engine for gechamp
12it's not going to lose
mi bf says i should go to doc :P he crazy....
lol
heh
*can't go til next month
:(
Did anyone catch what I said?
12no
2nope

!define code geass
12oh anime

12i thought that name sounded familiar
interesting story actually XD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf6XRk4DmEI
12no
what if you accidently stepped on it?
well semi interesting, to be fair
12lol
i won't i'm used to taking care of baby bunnies that are found in the neighbor hood that the mom's abandoned
at the beginning a bit slow
though near the end it gets at its best
Meow :Ð·
the fact that I'm using IRC on my new mac is quite amusing
considering it's supposed to be incompatible :P
and yet the chat is dead
12ol
12you got a mac Aurora?
2ewwww Mac
2!mac
/me sits back with her coke and watchs the crickets
2!apple
12EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW ITUNES
12Aurora
12IRC is compatible with Mac
12just not some of the clients like mIRC
well even the IRC site says not compatible
but I have crossover, so wheeee
12you read wrong then 8D
I've got paint sai working, IRC (but i'll need the IRC from my other computer first)
no I didn't lol
12then whoever posted that page mistyped
http://www.mirc.com/help/mac.html
first line lol
12you said IRC
12not mIRC
...
where the heck did my "m" go in that forst line...
Hehe
first
dfhjdf
12don't you mean the "m" in all those lines XD
well, I usually say IRC
but I meant to say mIRC the first time to be specific
2*mIRC
guess my fingers didn't get the memo
2or they did and ignored it
12i'd get a mac
correction: I've got mIRC installed now :>
12but i'd quickly install windows on it afterwords XD
2lol
yeah I was going to install windows right away
but crossover works just as well
as I only would have wanted the programs
2Mac OS sucks
12you never know when you'll become a gamer Aurora :P
wut
12then you are going to need windows
not much of a gamer anymore
never was much of a computer gamer
12i agree
12platform gaming is so much more fun
12like with the 3DS
which I'm on the fence about
12try to get a computer to replicate that
/me breaks the fence
I'm dead excited for it, but I'm also scared of the price it'll be
12it won't be higher than 200
well then I might get it
because DSi is already close to that
12Aurora
12the problem is nintendo are marketing wizards
yeah >_>
12they purposely keep the supply low with stores
12so the demand stays high
12so getting one will be close to impossible
hmm....I'll transfer all my files to this computer tomorrow
I'm so tired...
I went to bed at midnight
and for the most bizarre reason woke up at 5
and couldn't for the life of me go back to sleep
12hah
12i've done the samething
12except with 3 and 4 AM
/me mews
ugh I did that once
12heh
anyways
I'm beat
12go sleep now
12or kyu will get you
I'll deal with computer stuff tomorrow
....why o-o;
/me shrugs
lol
12i'm just trying to scare yo
12u
well then
12night
I'll be taking my leve
leave

04heya Shiny
02Hey
/me goes back to playing Raze
02mmk
13Shiny~
02Pokestar~
02What are you doing up so late?
13._.
13It's only midnight
02I know, but you usually are off by 10 or 11
04Hiya
13No, midnight is my usually, meaning I don't have lots of time
13I finished page 2, btw
/me 13pushes Lyon off her
02Hurray~
/me is pushed off
/me crawls under Pokestar
/me 13sleeps on Shiny
02:3
02You getting tired?
13Somewhat
13I'll have to yard work tommorrow, then pack, then I leave for Wyoming.
02D:
02You should come to the other state with W
13I know, but I don't have family there. Besides, you aren't having your 50th wedding anniverisary this year?
02No, but a couple years ago my grandparents were .-.
13Heh, timing
02Besides, there's no stopping from coming out here for vacation or anything
13Anyway, I wish I could but I can't. But I'm excited for this trip, because its the first time we're bringing our dog with us :3
13But, what are the chances that we'd meet up, Shiny? xD
02Hmm
02Not very good
13See? It would be worse to know that I'm instate but we couldn't meet :/
02Depending where you guys go
02I mean...I'm guessing the first thing that pops into people's heads when someone says going to Wisconsin for vacation would be "Why would anyone want to go there?" XD
13:/
13My town isn't exactly what you would call a popular vacationing spot for Californians
02Not the point
02At least there are people who like going to your state for vacation
02Heck, I LIVE in Wisconsin, the first reason I think of when I say vacation here is cows
02Next would be the Wisconsin Dells
13Wisconsin Dells?
13Sorry, heh, never heard of it ^^;;
02Again
02That's probably why people would say "Why would we ever want to go there?"
02Ah speaking of Wisconsin Dells...
13Hmm?
02We'll be going there in a few weeks
02Coz my other cousin from...another state...is coming to visit

13I need to know what season it is to finish the last box
02Hmm...summer sounds good to me .-.
13xD
13Would that be Time of Running Prey or Time of no Sun?
02Running Prey
13K
13Btw, what's winter called again? Time of Frozen Waters?
02Time of No Sun
02Because winter there is hardly any sun
13So there's only two seasons?
02For ArcticSun yes
02And I feel like drawing them
13What about Fall? Would that fall into Running Prey (even though its cold) or No Sun (but there is Sun)?
/me 13pokes Shiny to draw them
02Um...naturally winter in very far north places have snow all the time and only summer/spring for about 2 weeks or something .0.
13Yeah...
13But No Sun only occurs for a short time in the cold season, what do we call those extra days?
02...

how so
that's just a bunch of comic characters
they're hand-drawn so it's not illegal :

That's like if I mention McDonald's I can get sued

you'll notice: The title is NEVER said entirely - therefore they couldn't be sued :)

you can't sue yourself for your own movie
so that's obviously not why

how did they get it?
well, Harry Potter was produced by Warner, Monsters Inc. by Disney Pixar
lawl at the trailer
therefore they COULD sue the other
yeah but saying Monsters Inc in a trailer for Monsters Inc...
..
look at what's not entirely said in the trailer

whatever the case is, I'm just doing it manually
http://friendsofirony.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/129056569656350354.jpg
advantages: You SEE on ONE CONSOLE which computer has which patches and is in which group
well the thing is all our computers have different OSes
some have XP, some have Windows 7 x86, some have 7 x64, some have 7 Enterprise oen or the other, some have Linux, etc
and?
so it's not like you can just shove updates on there
I don't see the problem
XP has different updates from 7
still don't see the problem
as do the x86 and x64 versions
o.o
whatever
this computer isn't even on the domain yet
as my boss didn't give me admin rights
so I have to get him to do it
well, if you had read what I posted you'd know: WSUS supports ALL Windows versions - from Windows 98 through Windows Datacenter Server 2k8
didn't Windows 7 come out after Server 2008?
Windows 7 and Windows Server 2k8 have the same Kernel architecture
oh
that's why the Service Pack 1 for Win7 will be released together with the Service Pack for Server 2008 - they're almost the same
but yes, Win7 is also supported by the Service
o.o they announced a 7 SP1?
of course. You can download a Beta since about a month
wtf is the point of a beta service pack?
for developers?
o.o
sigh, I love when Windows Update freezes
this is why you shouldn't install like 200 updates in one day LOL
that's what a beta is for - so big developers like those for Antivirus Software or hardware driver developers can fit their software for the future service pack
how do you think game devs can make games for consoles that aren't released? the same way as this, they release betas with the same functionality
and that's why you should use WSUS instead. If a computer's registered in the domain, you can monitor and administrate it through the console, knowing exactly which computer has which patch and is allowed which patch
well I just freshly installed Windows on it yesterday
then opened Windows Update and hit install all
big mistake I guess LOL
as it overloaded it, it's frozen a few times when downloading
http://friendsofirony.com/2010/05/08/ironic-photos-would-have-thought-prepared/
it not frozen, it's just too busy :P
XD
still, it's just taking ages to download the updates
I think the network's being overloaded or something, usually the internet here is fast

hrm - am I too rude for a support ticket?^^
LOL
as this PHP file is causing the SAME hassle like ALL OTHER pages I suggest you failed in configuring the PHP module correct for the server. Therefore I summon you to fix that error ASAP - preferably yesterday.
If you see yourself UNABLE to apply a fix so this PHP file is prompted correctly (which any even free host should be able to do - this is the LEAST I demand from you!) I see you not fulfilling your service and ultimately request to IMMEDIATELY back-out to the previous configuration. It's not my problem HOW you do it, but DO IT NOW!
Furthermore I set you in default by now!
heh
I saw the funniest hampster at petsmart

Thank god
I was getting ready to kick you LOL
I told the bot to ignore Kyu beacuse he kept abusing it
seriously, it's a fricking hassle to use VNC from here, please don't intentionally kill it...
hey, is it my fault your server is responding with swearing words if it's ask for explanation of common phrases on the net?
he could have answered "shut the f-word up" instead
for intentionally defining things that have swear words in them, absolutely
...
it just uses google
!define miserable failure
-!- During the 2004 U.S. presidential election, Google bombs were used to further various political agendas. Two of the first were the "miserable failure" Google bomb linked to George W. Bush's White House biography and the "waffles" Google bomb linked to John Kerry's website. ...
!define %

o.O
eh?
what are you talking about?
Oh egh
I was about to say something
but then I forgot what I was about to follow it up with!
Sorry x.x
d'oh
How are you though+
?
been kinda good til now....but now I see there's a new Twilight movie coming out....
http://friendsofirony.com/2010/01/25/ironic-photos-dont-think-ctrl-alt-del-can-help-with-this/
if I had three wishes - one of them would be to eradicate this kind of stuff from this part of the universe
by the way - it seems this Cyberhost Pro-company is a small one-person-shebeen....
ugh ok...do I have to pay for windows OS?
of course
how much
depends on what you want to do
and what you want to have
honestly, something that will get my art program running like it should
http://thereifixedit.com/2010/05/13/epic-kludge-photo-more-refreshing-than-recycled-air-at-least
around 80 dollars for a System Builder version of Win 7 Home Premium 32Bit ?
windows xp
XP is not for sale anymore
fffff
well, XP is 8 years old right now
I know
have you any idea how old that is in software-years?
I really just don't want to deal with this right now
really depressed me
I thought you got a fancy Mac now :P
why you're asking for Windows then?^^
I want people to shut up about this ok?
I didn't ASK for it
my parents just up and bought me one
and i'm sorry for being the one who's too nice to say no
take it and swap it for a real computer then^^
...
I love how understanding you lot are
>_>
/me cuddles Aurora
I CAN'T swap it, it would hurt their feelings
and you think it won't if you just put it into a corner, unable to use it like you want and smile over it?
I'm not going to put it in a corner
my old laptop is pretty much useless for now
virus wont go away
and it needs to be completely erased
my dad didn't do it the first time because he had bought me a new one that was being shipped to me
but my parents are gone for 2 weeks, so I'd be without a computer for that long
wish I was living closer to you. I'd fix your notebook within just a matter of hours^^
see that's just it...I don't want to say "oh thanks for the laptop that was more expensive than my car. I'm actually just going to leave it here and use the old crap I've had for 2 years"
once my dad gets home, he does still owe me a serial number for a legit photoshop
but I still want my old program...
unfortunately, not all windows software will run on a Mac
not even on a virtual machine
Hey
yeah so I've seen
it runs, but wont combine the tablet with the program
that's why there's a Wintel-Universe and a Mac-Universe
again, yes I know
still, if you have any problems, I'll do my best and help you
so, which program are you trying to install?
Paint Sai IS installed
usable via CrossOver
but wont recognize my tablet
which is a widely seen problem, according to the numbers of people on google asking for help
-_-;
....k, did you take a look at the Apple support forums then? Maybe those guys know a solution
maybe you just need to install specific drivers?
did you go to the tablet's manufacturer website and look for Mac drivers there?
it works just fine on a mac
but combining the two doesnt seem possible
so did my Bamboo on Windows 7 - but it was just a mouse. Additional functionality was only added when I istalled the drivers
so that's what I'd recommend here
give it a try - what can you loose?
which drivers?
maaaaaaan this is frustrating
for the tablet?
I just need this all to be transferred and settles
settled
and I'll be fine
it's just getting there that's the problem
whilst the first step is the hardest and the last step reaches the target, the steps in between those two are the best of all
as for with each step you learn, see new things and grow by doing them
well that didn't work
lets see....
oh
I also need drf's portable irc
I forgot this one is unregistered
I saw it by the font colour :P
yeh
http://failblog.org/2010/06/22/epic-fail-photos-product-fail-spree/ <- What is this I don't even.
welll.......
even GIMP doesn't recognize the tablet...
very interesting
indeed looks like a problem with the driver
may I ask for the model name?
I'll try and help you searching then :)
6lets see
6CTE-450 bamboo fun
6I dunno why the driver would just up and not work
6unless it takes issue with macs too
6but even then I don't understand, because it worked fine on the macs at school
you downloaded and installed it already?
6yes
6I installed the tablet last night
6and reinstalled the driver when you mentioned it
with the current drivers from the website?
tried these her? http://www.wacom.com/downloads/driver-detail.php?id=202
6yeh I tried the them
after you've installed the drivers, try plugging the tablet out and back in
6did that too
even on another USB port?
6yup
6once photoshop gets installed, we'll see if it's not just the programs having problems
as far as I read, Photoshop seems to also have that kind of problems
6yes but it worked at school
6so if it works here, then it's not the tablet
...
and again my cat's sitting on my lap
6yay pantry raids
6just found some girl scout cookies

most-useless-feature-ever-done
that's old news
so this other IRC i'm in has a vuvuzela bot

12Lol Lugia says he's heard the vuvuzelas in real life and they're annoying XD
but - if you say "banana" instead of any other key words, you get monkey cries in response^^
is lugia with you now arti?
12Yeh ^^
can i come say hi? :P
if I was in southern africa and someone next to me had such a thing, I'd either push it BEYOND his jaw and down to his stommach so he can learn burble with it...or push it up the other way so he'd be vuvufarting....
or both if another one has a second of those, too

looks like a kick into the nuts of a staff member sometimes helps ;)
I've gotten enough ï¿½'s for a few years now
04hmm
04i'm not surprised Espeon would have a pic like that
admin's not working, too. But looks like the admin's got to the problem now

12asdsgfmkg
1 month free, do that LOL
that's what I did with dreamhost
got a free month, it was nice, so I kept it
I'll see what I can do
12Because if Im testing hosts out, I will not have time before my contract runs out
you could probably put it onb ayleef too if you want
I don't think usotsuki minds
since we already have the database stuff installed
12Permanently or temp?
12Becuase I could pay you guys a fee
um
I dunno
I only mentioned doing it temporarily, heh
12Ok lol
need to update the system first
12Sorry, Arti is AFKand will be going out soon to buy food, and this is Lugia signing off til later ^v^ *flies*

12o.O
04the super buu AI in BT3
12Wb
04refuses to transform
@drf: Know what's a good thing about the host I looked for?
14Thanks Azure :>
these two points:
99.99% uptime guarantee
FREE comprehensive 24/7 support
12Yw :p
12*:P
pretty much all hosts will "guarantee" 99% uptime
04he likes to spawm genoicide blast XD
until it goes down and they say "whoops"
04*spam
and they all have support too, LOL
there's a difference between 99%, 99.9% and 99.99%
still
guaranteed really means nothing
it can still randomly die for 3 days
call it wishfull thinking
well, 99% means a page can be down for 3 days 15 hours and 36 minutes of downtime per year
/me squeaks very late
99.9% means 8 hours and 45 minutes of downtime per year
yes, but guarantees are pointless when *their servers go down*
it's all just statistics IMO
You missed an orgy the size of Mexico City
or well not really
nope, they are not
those are SLAs
04hi Quilava
04how goes
okay
SLA?
!define SLA

See, Cyber Host Pro says its uptime is 99.98%
._.
where?
and I say that's complete BS
:P
lol WUT
Espeon
WHAT
but they don't have 24/7 service :)
:O
http://www.webhostingstuff.com/company/CyberHostPro.html
that's not my point
and they're not in business since more than ten years
my point is any place can say they have whatever percent uptime
but that doesn't eman they DO
*mean
03Damn. That's pretty huge. o.o
/me hides :3
They can say they have 99.9999999999% uptime because they've lucked out and their connection hasn't gone down
Until that one time it does and they compeltely screw everybody over...

^ truth
i lost an old $1200 laptop in the attic, so why not?
12LOLwtf
in addition to another computer
so why spend more money than is needed on a crappy computeR?
when you can get a better one for like half>?
basically because i don't need two laptops
that are the exact same
so why not just go find the one you have/
Hey Proto!
because it was made 5 years ago? :P
lol
hey red dragon u come here often
and it's probably 3x as good as a current macbook?
me runs
*/me
XD
i'm getting a normal laptop anyway, i'm just getting this because that $1200 cannot be used on anything else
12lol
what do you mean "on anything else"
it can only be spent on a laptop
insuranc
e
yeah but you can easily get a better laptop for $1200
like, with a quad core and some decent RAM, etxc
-x
maybe a Blu-Ray drive
i am
so then why mention Macs?
[3:36:02 pm] in addition to another computer
one i'm going to spend on a PC, the other i (might) spend on a mac
yeah but why waste money at all?
just keep it for something else
i cant... lol
your parents are letting you buy two computers and only computers?
otherwise i would, but i don't really have an option
read lo
[3:38:06 pm] insurance
insurance is paying for two computers?
ok let me rewind, we had a fire
yes I heard
one is gone, the other is not working properly
yes basically
we *have* to buy laptops with the money, which is kinda silly but eh
so get a desktop and a lap...what?
I got an idea then
buy a Macbook, then sell it and buy a really good desktop
/me runs
LOL
you actually have a point xD
just played a 19/0/3 game
http://graphjam.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/funny-graphs-stepping-banana.jpg
lol
04lol
04that's better than anything i've done
04best i've done was 15/3/15
is my best game so far
but no deaths is always good
04i'm trying to get used to TF
04but playing him gives me a massive headache
why?
04well TF is about being hard hitting
04you know what stacked deck and pick a card does right?
yes
04basically early game the strategy is to setup stacked deck so the next attack does the bonus damage
04then pick a card and get red, then hit the champion
04then if you get lucky ignite them
Im out, will be back later.
honestly ignite is only really useful in the beginning of the game, lol
04well yeah
its how I tend to get my early kills
04it's supposed to be how you get first blood
04if they run
04you flash over to them and finish them of
04f
I use ignite/teleport
04tf almost needs flash
destiny does the same thing, but with unlimited range
and its not quite instant
04flash just helps you get some distance after you destiny
04or escape if things didn't quite go as planned
I have rocet jump for that
04TF doesn't have rocket jump XD
04anyway i'm trying to learn TF
WELL HE SHOULD HAVE IT D:<
04he's so hard to play late game though
04you have so much attack speed that it's hard to keep the deck stacked at 3 for your kills
I usually would use yellow cards instead
04yellow is great for ganks
especially later in the game
04red is great for farming and damage
14I misread ganks
/me shot
lol
04Altair
04there is a character in this game with martydom
04literally XD
:D
03ur
04actually Quilava i played against him yesterday
04that ability is no fair
what about the ult that hits EVERY ENEMY CHAMPOIN
04the body actually runs around and chases you
*champion
oh, what
04after he dies
yeah that's not really fair
04the body just sort of squirms over to you FAST as heck
04not to mention it does a decent amount of damage as well
actually Anivia's passive is pretty good as well
04the egg thing?
04yeah
yeah. its like that armor thing
revives every now and then
04anivia can play really aggressive early game
04because that egg is hard to kill
yeah. but it doesn't fare so well in mobs
04well yeah

04mobbing is the only way
04or if you die in tower range XD
04the turret will easily kill you
yeahhh. but they always do that
unless you're a tank with your 3k health
04it'd be so easy for a tris
04to like rocket jump behind them
04then ulti them into the tower
see ya later spyo rocks
that never happens. trust me
maybe against noobs, but still

a lot of them really suck to fight
like ashe's freaking ult
hate.
04his ult is so cheap though
04i'm just going to magically damage all you champions
04it's like the easiest ulti to get a double kill with
I'd say master yi's is pretty easy too.

well.. yet
04probably shaco or twitch

04it takes too much thought
04i dunno
04i want a non-squishy as a secondary

6UUUUUUUUGH JUSTIN BEIBER
/me 6hisses
03thought you'd like laughing at that though :P
Didnt he hit puberty or is he somehow still evading it?
03Hi :3
6my friend (who loves his music) and I went shopping yesterday
6and we had to listen to it on the way up
6and then we went into a store...where they had it playing
speaking of justing Beiber, yesterday I was watching a review of one of his latest collab songs, and guess what. He was wearing pink shirt, red belt, and lip stick
6I was like "ffs REALLY?"
"the justin beiber circle of hell"
6^doesn't suprise
10Hey Sneas :3
6hard choice though
6Justin Beiber
6or John mayer
didn't think it would. And damn, his voice is so horribly girly. Dang, if he had needed auto-tunning, I swear, I think he'd sound like Ke$ha
6LOL SKYLANDS
J: that reminds me of "MIM" talk XD
6I remember making a joke about the same thing
6...
10He would look better as a Bibarel tbh
that's insulting to all Bibarel! D<
/me 6never noted Ke$ha compared to bieber
/me 6now notes the similarities
/me just notes of the funny MIM talk J made :O
04omg Quilava
04that boils me with rage
hm?
04when they destroy your nexus
04before you can even call a surrender
wow.
6hmm...
were you doing the whole sit in the corner thing?
6I might be needing to buy some new tablet nubbs...
04no
04but 3 of the players in our team were
03nubbds?
03-d
041 from the very start
hey carie!
well there's nothing you can do about that
6the tip of a tablet pen
03go buy a stylus LOL
Well, it gets them more points.
04i don't give enemies the honor of destroying the nexus
04that's my motto
6meh
lol
6are they expensive?
what up/
6pens are WAY expensive
04but of course if you cant call surrender before that happens
6like...over half the tablet cost
03styluses are 3 for $5
03:P
03like, the DS ones
6...
6um
04screw this
03you can even get like, Pokémon tipped ones
03for $10
04i need to find a tank character i can actually play good
6tablet pens are way different than styluses
03orly?
is spyro rocks on?
6this isn't a touch tablet lol
03it's just plastic at the end, right?
03....
03wtf kind of a tablet do you have
03in the one I used it was just touch sensitive
03and it was literally a stylus LOL
6tbh, I've never heard of a touch tablet
04only question is
04who is a good tank
6but it makes sense I guess
03the ones we had at camp were
03Wacom tablets
03this pisses me off
nice first episode here
6^
03there was even a mouse you could put on it LOL
6wacom bamboo fun
03erm
6that's the kind I have
03700 new emails mostly spam
03that was just a normal stylus o.o
6my mouse is shoved in my drawer though
03you could touch it with your finger
6...
03and it would move
try dr mundo?
6oh well
03try it LOL
6this one isn't touch
03try just using your finger

6I love my tablet, never had a problem
ohwait
03it was such an annoyance, I was like "Who the frick actually LIKES these"
wrong guy lol
03it was so hard to use, as it was way TOO sensitive
04because a team of 5 squishies
6except when I messed up the drivers once
hey
thats the guy who sits near turrets and taunts
04does not make a good team
6that's why i don't use the mouse

6that was random
nassus is actually pretty easy to kill
he's just annoying in combination with people who can stun/slow you
was it because of Justin Beiber? :P
04yeah i've played him a couple times
04Rummus seems to be hard to get kills with as well though
6ugh
04or rather he's just plain hard to play
/me 6burns him
taunt near a turret.
04usually they don't let you get close
Man, they show alot of people in this first episode
I'm currently working on the forum. That's why
no, near YOUR turret
04you have to power spin into them, then taunt them into the turret
oh.
yeah makes sense at least
need to do MAJOR tweaks now
04because without it
04they will just stay out of your range
04and attack the turret from there
unless they're melee too.
6major tweaks?
www.lugia.us/forum
6what happened, exactly?
that link should work by now
04i wish i can well you know
04start the game with Nassus
04with Q having like a +4885002 boost or something XD
6oh hey it does
just use it all the time on weak enemies
looks like whatever they changed does conflict with some entries in the .htaccess-file and the url-translator we had installed
6so does the main site
04mathmatically
04you should use his one ability spirit fire i think it is
6ok just kidding
6the main page of the main site does
6content doesn't
04at rank 1 it does just enough damage so that you can one shot minions with Q
ah
10Same with the forums, if you try accessing your profile, it won't work
04hmm
still that would require other minions to not kill them
04i haven't seen very many Amumus
6mhmmhm
04maybe i should learn to play him XD
profile will work - but not through this messy url
10It appears there's no reason to get hopes up at this point, heh
XD oh look even King Bradley is in here
oh just cut it out, will ya?
04that's what i'll do XD
04he has fantastic health
we just found the problem and all I need is a bit time to get used to this pile of mess and get things sorted. If you just wait an hour or so so I can figure out where I need to tweak what everything should bein apple pie order
04and his abilities are annoying
10...
03bbs
04http://www.leaguecraft.com/skins/57,Spider+Man+by+Madrox
04LOL
meh night
I hate anything that stuns.
k, a few links fixed, PLENTY more to go
oh so thats its name; Ouroboros
the switch to another server really messed up almost MOST of the links oO
04Quilava i agree
04stuns are so cowardly D:
04why does Amumu have so many funny skins
6O-O
04http://www.leaguecraft.com/skins/756,IronMumu+%28+Ironman+%2B+Amumu+%29+V1.1
they're cheap too
especially considering when they're LONG stuns
04i'm referring to the customs
04oh stuns
like.. 5s long ones
04many things about LoL is cheap
04stuns
04some ultimates are unfair
mine looks worthless compared to most others :(
sure it hits hard.. but so does every single other one
04honestly if you ask me Quilava
04i don't think destiny should have a teleport option
04knowing where they all are is already such a huge advantage
still
same with pantheon though. he teleports and attacks for lots of damage
oAo for some reason it says my session timed out when I try to post
04at least Pantheon
even though I just clicked on the button to post
04his teleport becomes so obvious and gives you lots of time to escape
6lol
you can see twisted fate's cards before he warps
and I never have enough time to escape >.>
I wasn't lingering on the 'post reply' thing either
6ok so...I should go now
D: bye Roara~
6actually no, I should get my music all sorted
04i escape every once in awhile
XD
04you can see TF's cards as well
I only do if I rocket jump at the exact moment as it starts
04but the thing is is that it's usually goes by so fast
6this'll only take forever
posting works for me
6woah
6that actually went really fast...
:/
12zzzz
6my old computer would have taken eons to work
12Lugia and Andrew have only JUST left :3
6Arti
6~
Heya Arti~ :D
:D
12Awesome night, wish Xai was there
12WOAH
12LOOOOOL
12YOU'RE HOME ALREADY LMAO
YA
6lOL
XD
that was a fun evening thanks arti ^^
12LOL in the time it took me to put the dishes in the dishwasher XD
12^v^ no prob, thanks for the lift
6wait
6yall had the meet already?
12No
12XD
12Just Lugia and Andrew were here
6oh LOL
Aurora - i live near arti
12...
12TST is working ovO
O_O
6Arti, some of it
awesome!
12Oh great :/
12Wow
12Hi
12we did some tests and tempory renamed your htaccess to htaccessold this then allowed your site to be loaded, we changed the filename back incase anything was required backend wise that we may of broken etc, its something in your htaccess causing this that is not compatable with litespeed.
12God the guy can't even spell, that's pathetic
looks like openNEF ENTIRELY messed up everything
6err
6copypaste fail
12I mean at work when we write our support tickets we make sure to use proper spelling and punctuation....
12LOOOOOL
04pantheon i notice the circle rather easily
12Great :/ my short urls aren't working
04pantheon is so mean
I just can't react in time I guess
that or my ping kills me
03o.o
03what short URLs?
03the site appears to be working fine now
04my reflexes are horrible
12http://lugia.us/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=40&Itemid=112
12http://lugia.us/about-me.htm
04in shooter games
03oh
03yeah it 404s
04i usually die by grenades a lot
03I thought you meant like /forum which works
04my reflexes are that bad XD
oh yeah
umm arti,
do you know what "SQL" is?
12I cannot believe htaccess can cause so much hassle
12Of course I do Ovo;;;;;
12I use it every day
12At work
oheytstorm
12and on TST
because when you said lunar has a "crappy SQL connection"
I'd be more likely to not notice till I'm dead
!weather 54650
12MySQL I said, and it does
that doesn't really make sense?
04you know what i hate most
03lunamr?
12Connection from pages to Mysql databases
03-m
04is when you are in a gigantic crowd
12It's too slow, same with most "all you can eat" hosts
oh
03all you can eat hosts are awesome for just plain data XD
12Yes
k, top bar is fixed
12Agreed
04i can never piece together what the heck is going on lol
03I still love how I got a Dreamhost account for $9 for an entire year
I just activate rapid fire and pick a champion to shoot
and if my HP gets low, jump away
12But when you have static pages, unless you host media, you don't really need all that space..
03I even run like, torrents off it LOL
or if I notice someone weak, kill them
03I gave myself SSH access :)
04rocket jump is too good
03no duh, of course I host media
03I have gigs of music, videos, pirated warez, etc etc on there
03:P
12Yeh but most people don't
04offensive, defensive doesn't matter
12They just host their personal website or whatever
I have a hard time hitting with it
03LOL that's so lame
03why would anyone pay for that?
03besides a domain name?
lugia.us/forum is mostly fixed now. All Arti needs to do is fix the Gallery preview in the footer
04i know what you mean
03I think the point of having unlimited bandwidth is to use it XD
but I think that's just a small tweak on the source file to modify the web address contained
04http://www.leaguecraft.com/skins/278,Sonic+the+Hedgehog+by+Jamesio
04lol
04fail
6Korean HTTYD poster is awesome
12We're not supposed to use /forum though :/
12It's supposed to be http://lugia.us/component/option,com_smf/Itemid,129/
:o
When did you come on here? :o
You snuck on!
:D
/me didn't see
hey so arti, you bought all the pokemon soundtracks from japan?
I just wonder why
03<Articuno> We're not supposed to use /forum though :/ <-- why?
12No haha
03I always use it and never had any problems
http://fukung.net/v/843/060410_hair.jpg
same - plus this /component/...is as intuitive as a fusion reactor :P
12DRF I told you why before, you agreed, Im not explaining again, it has taken me many years of work on TST to come to that decision
:|
03isn't that technically the host's problem? :P
12No
12It's actually the bridge between the forum and the main site
03so you just failed in writing the site? LOL
12I didn't write the bridge
12It's a bit of software
03o.o
:P
03still, I don't see why you should tell people to use one or the other, they both work fine 99.9% of the time
03and you could just make /forum redirect to the long one if you're that concerned
i good
12No they don't ok?
03or better yet, iframe it
03if it doesn't work than how come I have never had a single problem with it?
12You dont see why because you haven't worked on the site backend
12So don't question me
03and for that matter my proxy was the only thing that actually worked for a while :P
03with the short one
12Thats nice
03so it's not that broken IMO
anyways - the page is working atm. - the essential things at least
u?
12I can't login
03anyway Articuno, if you want to force people into using the long URL, just iframe it inside the short one
12Hold on, it'sok now
12I don;t think I can move the site over easily unless I try tomorrow night
12So apparently this litespeed is so much better than apache..
03bbl dinner
03and what, apache ftw
just tested with IE - which had zero contact with TST until now. I could login properly over the main page and switch to the forum
the Logout button of the forum seems to be broken right now - one thing to be fixed on medium priority
the Logout-Button on the main page works
04Spell Effect
04lol
12It works for me
Logging in via the Main Page also logs me in on the Forum
12*sigh*
vice versa, too
12Did the host actually announce this litespeed then?
12did you find anything?
nope, nothing
04i like this guys logic
04step 1 - turn on, step 2 - stand next to enemy, step 3 - watch as they fall over and die
12No me neither ¬¬
another reason why we should think about moving to an own server. Especially because of all the size TST is taking over the time
12phone
on our server WE have control over what's installed
12Yes
04Spell Effect
04Amumu entangles surrounding enemy units, causing them to be unable to move or attack for 2.5 seconds, dealing 50 / 100 / 150 (+0.35 per ability power) magic damage to them each second.
12I'm seriously angry at this but anyway..
12*sigh* I have to go round and edit every single theme index file now to get the forum link to work on the top menu
12I can't do that now because it's too late and I'm tired and need sleep
sou lots of stuff is hjardcoded html?
12Not loads of stuff but a few tings
12:>
I did already
12Problem is there's a million site themes to edit lol
lihttpd/nginx?
12What about it?
12Oh sorry you're asking which one?
the main thing about lightspeed is: it compresses and prefetches different, throttling most clear-text-pages
oh
12I actually think my host are using the paid for version which is litespeed
12Well anyway..
12I'm a bit worried now, if Litespeed is the future of the web, I don't know if TST can keep up with that :/
12*sigh* I'm logged out of the site again for some reason
ugh, i bored :( i going to go do something
ttyl peeps
it's scared of you
doesn't look like the future for me. In fact, Lightspeedtech is amlost entirely unknown in the EMEA region
12Ok
the "most recent" version of Lightspeed is from January 2009!
the host just bought some pre-configured tins with this up because they wanted to boost performance in exchange for features...
12Yeh lousy host. I can't believe they just DID it one day
12Anyway
12Im off to bed
you actually profit from the killing them. lol
/me hugs
12Couldn't have done it without you
/me cuddles back
12I'll try and sort everything out tomorrow
I told you - TST is an important piece for me
so are you
12^v^
12Well night and speak to you soon
I hope so, yeah
12you will
12night all!
good for now the page's fixed mostly
Wb Aero
I think when I take vacation I'll try and rework the ENTIRE page so it's more easily to administer. Currently it's more like a giant mess of patches glueing on each other without giving sufficient support
Alright... after that minor delay, hello people.
04Quilava mercury treads might be my favorite item XD
I actually tend not to use them. lol
04what the heck is up with this guy's reccommended item build
04heart of gold (975)
04Ninja tabi/mercury treads (1200)
04Banshees veil (2715)/ sunfire cape (2850)

044 sunfire capes XD
hi and urgh - either I go to bed now and end this day full of stress and work OR I open my first bottle Afri Cola and ignore my body being tired and forcing me into bed
04come near me you super die
The answer to that question depends on what you wish to do.
that's the problem
my brain says "go to bed you fool! I need to rest!" but my heart says "stay here and continue working!"
Also, 04<insert expletive here> you Honduras! :|
with the brain insisting "I can't work without sufficient sleep!"
and the heart countering "and I can't sleep with still so much work to do!"
hi hi Night
heya Nyte
Compromise... do your work in the half-sleep mode. :P
I love Merc Boots. <3
@calc 40*4

(Unfortunately... your work may end up equivalent to work that was "penned in a drunken stupor." :P )
04nevermind found it
04when using a character
04i like having a notepad open for notes like item build and blahblah
lol

04Quilava
04my amumu training isn't going well XD
04the first match i get into the team-mate was all "NOOOOO AMUMU!"
04decided that wasn't a good time for me to start my first match with him so i quit out, had to wait a couple minutes to start another match, this time the screen glitched up so i had to quit out again and this time i had to wait 9 minutes
4W5ell 4D5one7!!! 5You just tried to cheat by typing loads, it LOST you double what you hoped to make.

14I was soooooo looking forward to Roulette (splol?) being on HGSS, but instead we got Voltorb Flib D:
14*Flip
14LOL
I know, right
Why did they have to take out the slots for this?
14And you can't even buy coins anymore.
Did parents complain about the game teaching kids how to gamble or something?
04the worst part is that the community with this game is fantastic
14LOL
04i've seen very little jerks
Because that would be bull if they did
14Well, I admit, the slots WERE addicting
14But I know better than to do it IRL
I played Mario 2 and pokemon sapphire when I was 8, and did I gamble at all irl? No.
12hmm
14I mean, I don't even think there are any casinos around her
14e
maybe you should play something more fun.
14And I dont bet at school
04fun doesn't exist to me, unless if i actually feel like i'm good at it
04no i'm not connecting doing good with winning
04but if i do horrible in a match i feel very down
04sadly horrible is how i do with everything

what id you typoed typo? :p
*if
Tipo
play 1D tetris.
Typo*
Like that
you did that on purpose XD
041D tetris isn't multiplayer
04at least i don't think it is XD
It would be hilarious
Yep :p
someone should make multiplayer 1D tetris then
04what is 1d tetris anyway
its tetris in one dimension
its as many blocks tall as it would normally be, and one block wide. the new pieces are a 4 block line, a 3 block line, and a 2 block line
041d doesn't exist
yes it does
Sooo...
04sig
What now?
04h
04either way i've played tetris before
04i sucked at it 8D
14Your face
/me flees
Well I'm just talking about how much I loath this one kid at my school
14LOL
you can't physically suck at 1D tetris unless you're hacking
who called everything 'gay'
14Well, I just cleared Voltorb Flip Lv 1 XD
14LOOL
literally
"this homework is gay, congress is gay,etc"
Well that's everyone at my school for you.
and a tea bagger too >>
And that's why I'm here
14Whee~
http://www.tetris1d.org/
what all of your classmates are tea baggers?
14Tomorrow is a picnic thingie at my dad's workplace 8D
if you can suck at this game, I'll believe anything you say
14And Nalex can come LOL
Oh wait, I have to rp now
Later
14It's only been a week since I've seen her LOL
"I havent seen in you in FOREVER"
"you mean a week?"
14LOL
14Holy snap
snap is holy? :O
14I just cleared a row of Voltorb FLip cards
/me dies
14And I didn't choose the card with Voltorb under it ._.
04now that i know what you are talking about
04the main question is
04"is this really a game?"
yes
it is in the same way as 'don't shoot the puppy'
03LOL
03Twilight, want a Voltorb Flip cheat site?
oi drf
drf: you know cheating is wrong :P
03and sigh
03I need longer speaker wire
03stupid ones that came with it are too short
03it looks tacky LOL
ive gotten about 10 downloads on average for each Mythbusters ep I encoded
why so?
03why so what?
not too bad eh?
03I guess
03also EW
03but it has some funky plug, I wonder if I could get some other sort of dock as well XD
03http://esper.vacau.com/voltorb/index.php
03yep
03just put in the numbers and try it XD
2 seconds :O
a new drf record
032 seconds what o.o
for the site XD
04i keep forgetting what mia stands for
04missing in action?
yes
04maybe i keep forgetting because it doesn't make any sense
oh yea, drf
03what
i found a 800p of the pacifier, but it's on emule =\
03LOL
03eh, not that big of a deal
how does it not make sense?
all the other sites have a crappy 536p done by REVILLE
dem cocky boys
03hm
03is it on Blu-Ray?
it is
I cannot mount correctly
03so then why is it so rare LOL?
This is angring me
its old
and noone bothers to rip it
03I could get it from Blockbuster
03if you really want that movie
02o.o
The files dissapear
nah, ill just download a 536p and reencode it
PowerISO is the only one I can use right
but aren't ALL boys cocky? that's what makes them male!
03w/e you want
:S
... Lawl
02that's the point lol
04well this game has no action 8D
04sigh Rammus isn't good
I thought you quit
03LOL wut
04he can't do anything without a turret and/or against a range
04i'm still trying to get banned
/me is away: afk
you're seriously getting yourself banned?
04i wish i could
why don't you just uninstall the game >.>
04meh
04i don't know Quilava
04why haven't i installed WoW yet
04*uninstalled

because you aren't desperate for hard disc space
but you can solve that by downloading all the porn you can onto your coputer
Meow :3
04I find it funny that Chime spoke right after Quil said 'porn'
/me hides
LOLz
psh, he's looking at some RIGHT NOW.
04heh
04the thing is that i downloaded this game
04only problem is now i'm miserable lol
Heya pplz~
you tried :| if its making you miserable you should stop
04then i'd feel guilty
ohai Aero again
hello
00:50 <Quilava> psh, he's looking at some RIGHT NOW. <-- orly
04yarly
what time is it over in Korea?
04well...
04that's the 8th game in a roll i lost
12probably around noon
lol
It's about 2 PM
LOL 2 PM
04why is my luck so bad
/me asplodes
bah, Korean boygroups are still weird to me
04it's not that i get paired up with bad players
you need to level up more
04but the fact that i keep getting paired up against pros
04i'm level 14
04almost 15
04LOLWUT AERO
w00t, caektime

/me shot
12happy birthday aero
12:D
04i don't know what to do with rammus anymore
12nah just kidding happy birthday Lyon
happy b-day lyon :O
Aero: Korean wut
Sadly the Cake is a lie
04lolwut
So we made you emperor instead :D
04Brother, it's not my b'day
04i think i have an almost perfect item build for him
04but i can't do anything unless i'm near a tower
yeahhh.
Steel or Daedric? :P
04neither
04for rammus i think i have it near perfect
04apparently someone doesn't understand taunt
sweet.
04well we could of killed someone but my friend runs while he's taunted
04summoner skills i need to put reconsideration into
04i think he NEEDS teleport
04i can't do anything with rammus
04i've gone the first 20 minutes of this match 0/1/0
sounds AWESOME.
04how dull
there needs to be a game where all champions get 0/0/0
04now that is being an ass XD
04i call a surrender
04i get 4 against
04someone else calls a surrender they all approve
you've already got a reputation
04i should be gaining respect
04i'm always able to look at the game 5 minutes later
04and say who is going to win
you mean surrender the moment its possible
04i've been 100% accurate so far
04i never made a wrong prediction lol
04i'll have to get more Riot points to buy more tanks
I thought you said you were going to get yourself banned >.>
04i am but why not spend more money on it
..because if you get banned you lose your money
04true
04still
04i'm so conflicted
how about earn IP and spend that instead >.>
04i just want people to know for once that i'm more than just a failing idiot
a failing idiot with money?
04can you just forget about the banning and money for one second?
sure
04i don't really want to get banned
04but with how my attitude is right now and how much i'm restraining
04i don't know if i really have a choice in the matter
04i just feel like i'm a bomb that's going to explode and the only way to vent it out is to complain my head off
you could just stop playing and do something else
04i need to practice
04..
04or i won't get better
04hmm
04i wonder if i can take poppy
04and build a tank out of her
everyone does that already
04it's funny because the game itself
04doesn't really list her as a tank
04but she has incredibly high health
and a <censored> jump-to-the-enemy=and=stun-them attack
04lol
04i like her ulti
which does?
04basically she chooses a target
04while her ulti is in effect no one else can harm her except her target
lolcheap
explains a lot though
04it does?
when I shoot and they don't take damage
04lol
04i have to agree with you though
04dr. mundo is mean
yeah.
04dunno if he's what i'm looking for
04i'm looking for someone who is hard to kill
his ult is crazy like that.
his health regen goes up to like 50~100
so he drops HP a bit, lures an enemy, by the time they can get get him low he's regenerating, they die, he goes up to full HP
04sigh
04think think think
04lol did i mention last match
04one of the enemies scored a triple kill
04that was the only reason i died >_>
sounds fun.
I've only gotten 1 triple kill ever I think..
04i've never done it
actually.. I might have gotten two. not sure
04i'm still sad no one has thought of a Nasus lucario custom skin XD
but one was as master yi, so that doen't go on my main character's stat card >.>
04lol
04master yi is nasty >_>
04i've seen him work away at towers
04just not fair
heh. back when I used to use him, I took out both nexus turrets with one ult (thats less than 12s by the way) without minions or friendly champs with me
04there is so many unfair aspects about this game XD
but that makes it balanced!
what I really hate
is when someone uses a knockback skill JUST as I rocket jump. so I actually go BACKWARDS
04i was afraid you'd say that Quilava
04XD
04it's not the first time someone has told me that
gtg Going to my cousin's house
04i need to find someone else i'm good with x-x
I can't tell if its ordering errors or what, but it really pisses me off ><
especially when I could have easily escaped
04lol
04i've played Tris once
04messes can occur
yeah.
I like that I can knockback people through walls.
or jump over them
04Quilava
04i've been meaning to ask
04what does killing the dragon do?
.....no clue
look it up on the wiki?
04didn't really give io
04*info
04of course that can always change
04it gives global 200 experience and 130 gold to the killing team, as well as 25 gold and additional experience to the killer.
04hmm
decent
more gold than a turret.. and easier too
04finally logic i love
04your character is weak to stun
04so equip clense
lul
04so...
04let's see if i can lose 10 games in a roll now >_>
lol suicide
04yep, from the looks of the matchup
04i say we lost
lol.
matchup means nothing
04it can go either way
04but they play more annoying champions
04you are right though
04what does mean something though is setup
04a comanding setup means big troubl
04e
keep an eye out for which guys suck. and kill them
04you don't have to
04they come to you
still. if you switch lanes near the begining and they're somewhere else, hunt them down
04olaf omg i hate his axe XD
thats how I got my best game >.>
and yeah. me too
dr mundo has a similar attack, but without the splash damage
/me yawns..
/me colapses and goes to sleep
02RETARDED PIANO LESSONS ARE RETARDED
eh?
/me is back.
02also I hate being PMed constantly

02I was helping him
04lol
02So I decided to chat etc.
02well, at one point
02he was like "How long do you play (piano) each day?"
02And I was like "At least an hour"
02And he was like "Only? My son, who is in the Conservatorium of Music, played for 4 hours every day after school"

04loool
04hey
04NS, if I made an RP on HoR, you reckon you, Xeli and I could keep it alive?

02stall teams take forever
04yeah

hiya
Proto: Everyone's so mean to Wesley Crusher :(
Because he's arrogant and annoying
there's only one time I've felt bad for him
He always saves the ship though, but that's never good enough for anyone
Because he's arrogant little ass >_>
And he only saves the ship once I've seen
when Data's brother first came into the show
He saved it lots in Season 1
Or had a strong role in saving it

Auroa: wat XD
6I didn't see the blu-ray ones...
same, kind of bored though
over 300 DVDs?
6maybe i missed them
03where'd you look?
03try like Target?
6we have so many dvds here
do u think they will make another spyro game?
6yeah target
i hope so
03wtf
o
03AMazon?
6but I easily coulda missed it
*i'd like to see another one
12Hi.
what DVDs on all things from the Matrix to Disney?
/me calls a friend
12No.
rly? cool
03LOL sex references in Toy Story
03this is precisely why these movies are good
6LOLWUT
Which reference? XD
03they're not just "BLAHBLAH THINGS ONLY 3 YEAR OLDS WOULD GET"
03with Bo Peep thanking Woody for saving her sheep
03"What do you say I get someone ELSE to watch the sheep tonight?"
XDD
6oh loool
6I think I remember a blunt statement like that in the 3rd one
That reminds me of the animaniac references
6can't remember which
yup
03yeah
03"Nice ascot"?
/me hides
04hi Quilava
hi
04:)
04how goes
shame they didn't have a spyro movie
gine
*fine
they did they just cancelld it...
that's what i mean, shame
04great
04i had a couple interested matches after you slept
04i tried getting used to Nasus
i wanna give those peeps a piece of my mind!
lol
04i can't get his Q to be super charged though
04the highest i ever got was like +80 something
that takes a lot of time.
and 80 is pretty decent
200 on a regular hit
03you know
03there are so many toys in this first movie, that aren't in TS3
03like the little microphone thing
03and the snake
03etc
Or the Fire truck
03XD the toy soldiers using the baby monitor
03that too
04yeah
ive been waiting 4 that movie to come out sinse 2008 when i herd about it
04i learned the trick
I rememebr those :O
my win rate is almost up to 50% yay
same
I still have those too XD
:( stinks
04since ranking up Q makes it cost more mana
04the trick is to not rank it up until late game
wouldn't a new beginning be more fun if they got rid of the annoying levels?
04i usually get spirit fire first, then that ability, then i rank spirit fire upto 4 then get wither to 5
the first blood record doesn't work D:
hey if they make a new game there should be a 3 player co-op w/ sparx ,spyro, and cynder
Isnt it hilarious how in Toy Story 3 it got so dark?
04first blood record?
on your personal page
click on the champion you've used most on the right
and it'll say 'total first blood = 0' even if you've gotten some
04what does Penta kill mean
12You really can't do much with Sparx...
5 kills in a short time
aka, kill the entire team
12But, whatever....
04so an ace?
no
true
ace is a kill without taking damage
04btw
03yeah
04my prediction was almost wrong last night XD
you know how a double kill works right?
04i had a feeling were going to lose this match but everyone is like
if i had made new beginning i would of gotten rid of dantes freezer
and tall plains
its like "You got a friend in me-BURN BURN IN FIRE MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAH"
03XD
and put in two cooler places
04"we've come back from worse" not beliving them i continued to do my best only to prove them wrong
04the game came down to who can kill the nexus first, we were both damaging eachother's nexus's XD
What is it with kid movies and being Dark XD
03aww, poor Woody, just got knocked off the bed
04they won by a mere split second
Lion King, his father dies when he's a kid
lol
Bambi his mother gets kid and no one to even guide him XD
04i really got a kick out of that
That elphant is lost from his mother
04i thought we actually won the game so i'm like "NOOOOOO"
04then the screen starts scrolling over to our nexus so i'm thinking "what?"
NEEDS MORE ATTACK SPEED
04actually
04we would of won
i'd put in a electric world and a castle world
04but i didn't notice they were at our nexus so i took my time to finish an inhibator
they would have won if you weren't their teammate is my guess
04i was the one who were there
04*who was
04along with a teemo
04everyone else was dead lol
darn...still only 62
out of greeting ideas so hi
Hi
04still though, i didn't think it was even remotely possible to get a game to be that close
^^
its very possible.
happens quite often supprisingly
12Or a longer flying level...
04i did my best, like i promised
04actually it was my mistake we lost that one
04if we attacked the nexus earlier we would of easily won
03XD more grownup humor
that too
03"The word I'm looking for, I can't say, because there's preschool toys present"
XD
04btw yeah i see what you mean, i've gotten first blood before
ok... but say in a new game w/ sparx u have to light toches to move on and u have a power to kill enimies( would be electricity or light)
04yet i don't see it counting
I've gotten like.. 3 total
12If anyone knows where to get a god shoutbox html let be know
12good
04i got 1
could do with a bug report there, as minor as it is
hmm
u could fly to
04was the first blood stat always there?
w/ sparx
probably
04or was that brand new with the update
no I've seen it before
03LOL god
04ok
04that rules out my theory then
03and here comes my favorite scene in the movie
12oops
03o/` Straaaange things, are happening to me o/`
12*godly shoutbox appears*
and I think I might actually be starting to get good
04btw dont' tell lightning this but....
I just need to hit level 21 so I can overpower myself
04i slayed the dragon D:
who hasn't?
"And you will know my name is the box, when i lay may shut apon thee"
04at level 6
*my
sounds overly time consuming
03LOL, the little pink haired troll is also not in TS3
04actually with Nasus's ultimate it's easy
6little binoculars
03yeah those too
hey im gonna go have lunch talk later justin ill send u a pm on spyro forums.!
03XD
6but didn't the voice actor for his die?
12what movie are you watching?
03no
03Toy Story
oh, I thought you meant with warwick
123?
03and Aurora, the VA for Slinky Dog died
03no, the first one
03but I do have a bootleg of the 3rd :P
Ah, thats why the Bum review did that XD
6so the slinky VA in the 3rd was different?
"Hey why is your voice different?"
12when i first watched that movie, my mom burned a potato and the potato exploded
03yes
03but he sounds a lot like the original
"well umn aofgwslfbsofgaofgvdkagbdaghdoiahgdikagdlshndk"
"oh~"
6yeah he does
03but you notice how he doesn't have many lines?
03I think that was intentional LOL
6yup
k
ttyl
04WW it's possible
03but yeah, the few lines he had DO sound a lot like the original guy
03...LOL
04i've heard of people doing it
03"You know Andy will have a special place for you" "Yeah, like the attic"
it sounds too time consuming. other things would be be better
12:)
6RC is gone
Back :D
6that was one of my fav caracters
03oddly enough in the third movie they actually WANT to go in the attic :P
04i don't think its worth it
03yeah
:D
12I like Jessie
03I liked the binoculars
04like you said it takes too long
6same
at higher levels maybe, when you can kill it fast
03if you weren't a girl I would make a joke
/me runs
12and the bo peep doll *shot*
the 130g would be really nice
04which is a disadvantage in more than one way
6.......lol
03Jessie isn't even hot, I mean seriously
/me runs
04it means you are likely to fall more behind in laning
thats 675 gold with one kill
04and more time means higher chance of an enemy spotting you and taking you out while jungling
03I love how bad the animation looks in this LOL
03even the toys look kinda crappy
if its in the begining of the game nobody goes into the jungle
04at level 6
6drf yeah
04some people will probably be trying to gank
6the VA for the binoculars died
04not to mention TF willy easily spot you
yeah
03hm
03oh
6same for the penguin
04*will
03the binoculars are Lenny?
6yes
03I'm trying to figure it out as Debian (Linux) names all its releases after Toy STory XD
03hm
03so who is Squeeze?
6squeeze wut
04that's why when i jungled with WW
the pengiun I think
03there's a character named Squeeze, apparently
03ah
03that makes sense
04and played against TF, i told my team-mates i want to know the very second TF hits level 6
03...
03woah, Lenny DOES talk
03he has like ONE line LOL
:O
12jessie isn't hot, just awesome
12and i am a girl, so... ew
6he's lighting it he's lighting it....hit the dirt
XD
12LOL
6and I dont know of a squeeze character
"hfosflshgflahfkasvdkab You Damn toy" < that would be his real response
6I know of Wheezy
03oh yeah, Wheezy is the pengiun
03<Aurora> he's lighting it he's lighting it....hit the dirt <- what?
6that was the penguin
6^lenny's line
6one of em
I should probably play another game now
03oh
03he was like "Right here, Woody'
04:)
03that's the line I heard
03XD
6yup
almost lv 15
when there was a toyocide D:
04i think i might learn to chill out
04before i play another game
12wheezy is loosing his squeak
03so where's the other line?
03oh
03right
6pretty close to where you are
03yeah
03I just heard it
6lol
03that's why I said oh right
/me rewinds
you're overly sensitive to losing :|
6xD
03I never got how that thing could talk
03it has no mouth
04you think?
its just a game
03LOL Virtual Realty
03I misread that as Virtual Reality when I was little
04everyone uses that line, think more unique
6._____.
03whee Pizza PLanet
03and ._. what
doesn't make it less true
dissapoint face? XD
6it sounded like whatever's been living in my attic just fell through the ceiling
04i'm just saying that if that line would of worked on me
03Wilhelm scream coming up
04it already would of effected me by now
6wil-wut

Lol No videos on Dante
04hey
04:P

04some people will just think you are fat
6oh that's what it is
04others will see you as someone they don't want to mess with, because you'd probably sit on them
03yeah
6I know what it is, but now I know the name
03it's used in ton of movies
03*tons
03including Toy Story
eh. never mind
6yup
*s
starting a game
14heya
14I'm mashed XD
03wow I'm stupid
03I accidentally closed WMP when playing this DVD
/me reopens >_>
XD
03as much as WMP sucks, it's the only program to properly play videos full-screen with two monitors
03so I'll use it occasionally
Thanks Curly!
12hmm
heya
heya
03XD a113
03LOL two toys fighting with each other
03you know
03how come Andy doesn't hear that
03the random "Buzz, buzz, buzz Lightyear to the rescue!"
03that Woody keeps pressing the button LOL
"oh well it must be one of this corporation screw ups on the toy" , andy's thoughts :P
03yeah but I mean
03how come he doesn't notice it's UNDER THE TOY
03*CAR
03not to mention
03he thought Buzz was at home
03not at the gas station
XD
its funny how he doesnt notice at all the toys are gone
and Pride is one sadistic guy XD
03Pride?
"Now Greed why should you be worrying about others lives when you're close to dying"
"You monster.."
"now you're being rude to your brother...May I eat you?"
03what are you watching o.o
"If you ate me, I think you'd get a stomach ach brother"
clips from Episode 47 of FMA Brotherhood
03oh
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FDV0CvHXvI&feature=related
though its all mirrored
03I'm watching a movie...
so its at the wrong place XD
03I love how the Pizza Planet truck has "How's my driving?" on the back and that dude drives like a maniac
"Hows my Driving?"
"fantastic..can I leave naos?"
03LOL, yes, a walking cup, NOBODY will notice that
"NUUUU"
03LOL "Astro... turf"
03Pizza Planet is so awesome
03I went to the one at Disney World, shame it was kinda lame compared to the movie :(
6wow.....
03what
6I used to love this movie
03I know right
6now that I watch it...it's super creepy
03what movie o.o
6Brave Little Toaster
OH
I have that series XD
03How come Sid doesn't get banned from Pizza PLanet for abusing all the machines LOL
the good one movie
and the other stupid ones
6like...that was the ceepiest scene I've seen in an animated film lmao
12lol
Yeah I know right? Remember the beginning of it?
It seemed..so bizare
6http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc5D6qxAGpo <-that one
03I'm already watching something >_>
6I wasn't pointing that out to anyone in particular :P
6but yeh, that AC scene o-o;
Hello ARi
03LOL "I <3 Explosives"
That was strange
6lol
How he just spontaniously died
6spontaniously exploded, you mean
6but lol
03LOL SID HAS A WAFFLE MAKER IN HIS ROOM
6talk about overreactions
12that's drfs nickname
03o.o
"ITS NOT MY FAULT IF HE COULDNT REACH IT, ITS MY FUCNTION ARRGRGRGLABFAHBFSBDKSBS *explodes*"
03just because I typed in caps doesn't mean it's overreacting
6not you, you feesh
03k
6TALK ABOUT OVERREACTIONS >:O
/me 6runs
/me puts Aurora in the room with the exploding floof AC :O
/me dies
04lol Quilava
04i just learned of /joke and /taunt
he sounds like a 60s hippie
seriously XD
6I thought that too LOL
its like He finally admitted he's Square :O
/me runs
6this toaster makes me want to punt kittens
Again? XD
03you know what I've never been able to figure out
6yup
03when Buzz is in Sid's house
03and he seeds the commercial on TV
03how come it was dead silent before and after? LOL
seeds?
:p
6xD
03XD Al's Toy Barn
:O
03...
03This song
03sounds a lot like this song in Phantom of the Opera
03"I Will Go Sailing No More"
03the notes are very similar
6phatommmmm
I Will Go Sailing...
I'm on a boat
/me shot
03XD
drf: whenever I see phantom, I want to destroy something XD
03why
Phantom Menance
^^
03I love that movie
Wut
6Dennis the Menance
sounds too...dr seus
so take your greed eggs and your green ham Sam I am :p
03so another thing that doesn't make sense
03if the toys can actually talk so humans can hear them
03like when he calls Hannah
6well duh, woody talks to sid later
03how come they don't just talk around people?
03like is there some "law"
Or when Sid reliazes his life will be torrmended by toys? XD
Yes
6breaks the rules of nature
03that they can't come alive in the presence of h8umans?
6:P
03-8
03XD
03but I mean
03why wouldn't they be defiant and just do it
But then heres a more interesting fact
03like even Buzz
03even when he thinks he's a real space ranger
If toys could talk, why didnt they talk before these new toys :p
03he drops dead when Andy walks in
6well, if you're supposedly on an alien planet
03*training
6and something 20 times your size walks in
6you'd drop dead too
03I'd be like "PLease don't hurt me"
12i'd run
actually he'd use someone as a distration to escape
03or that
12apparently toys
12are like fainting goats
12they see something that scrares them and fall over
Ok,y ou
03XD
6LOL FAINTING GOATS
6Those things are awesome
I misread that was
Fainting Ghosts
12*scares
lol
sounds obnoxious
04i tested it out on nasus
04his joke is "who let the dogs out woof woof woof"
/me coughs
I know lol
I just noticed
Hi
Pride's eyes are now purplish
yay lv 15
04just like me
048D
04i can't wait for level 20
I've gotten 2 wins today in less than 25 mins each
04i'm just going to go wild on buying tier 3 runes
04i wish people would see it my way more
lv 21 is better. you can get a mastery point into the best skills
04if a match looks hopeless
if it looks hopeless, win, and rub it in the opponents face
04they should just get it over with and start another match that they have better chances of winning, it's not so much as calling it quits as it is saving time
03OK how do like 9 year old kids order explosive rockets?
its like the phieus and ferb thing
03I don't watch that show
04the time you wasted turning the game around or just losing more
also I'm probably going somewhere soon so I gotta uh. clean myself
03I have somewhat high standards for the stuff I watch
so afk
"Arent you a little young to handle a intercontiental balistic missile?"
04could of been spent on another match you'll win
"Yes, yes I am"
04kk
"oh well OK, done start a nuclear war now"
*dont
04someone made an interested point
04that you don't get as much experience if you surrender
04but that can't than 10-15 experience lost
03still, SId randomly gets that rocket
03I doubt they had AMazon back in 1995 LOL
03so where did it come from?
12why are you talking so much about toy story
12it's a silly kids movie :P
03because I'mw atchin git
03*watching it
12hmm
and he needs to be serious now thats he's an adult watching a childrens movie :P
03OK what
03Buzz ripped the sticker off his arm
12you are just like seto kaiba
03and it comes back later on
12you are grown up
6...it does
only it isnt a children's card game
6?
12but you sit around and waste your time on a children's card game
03Yes
6LOL
6I never paid attention to that
03You don't notice how in Toy Story 2 he has the sticker?
03yeah me neither
03but now taht I'm wathcing it again
03LOL Binford
03Home Improvement reference XD
that's a third of losing experience
45 to 30
03since Tim Allen was in that show
03and they advertised Binford tools
also I'm not leaving quite yet.. still gotta wash some clothes >.>
poor fu
03I love how Woody is strong enough to fend off an average sized dog
04oh
04even if you lose half experience
04i don't think its worth it
03"We're going to have to break a few rules"... I don't get what makes the toys want to follow those rules
03about not coming alive around humans LOL
14XD
meh
04:)
04surrendering a match is a polite thing to do
I thought you just did it to spite them
04it saves time so you can start your next match and your opponents don't have to waste their effort finishing the match
6forgot how epic this movie was
6free willy
6music <3
SHINEN
04there is more than one reason for it :P
02o3o
Free Willy
That movie premise was so used it was original but yet its I love it XD
6That movie was so awesome
I think I still have Free willy 1-3
6I-
6yeah
6I've got all 3
XD
DVDs?
I bet you dont have totoro :P
6but I bought the 10th anniversary as DVD
6the last two are vhs
6brother, I used to have totoro on vhs
6lost it
I have all VHS
6....
:O
6oh crap
6I was going to say I have it on file on my laptop
XD its hilarious you seem to have mostly all the movies I have
6which is now unusable LOL
XD
6brother, I have so many movies lol
meh
"Totoro DENIES YOU"
Same
Mostly Disney >.<
ironic that I hate Disney to my very "soul"
6once they started dvds, we got dvds, but the earliers are still vhs
6early disney <3
Wait
I'm thinking of this one Movie..
NEMO
not the fish one
the other Nemo
the..dream wisher thing
02Speaking of early Disney
02I watched Lion King 1&2 the other day
I still have those
But Ling king 1/2 was a dissapointment
never got around to buy it, I dont like most disney sequels
or prequels
02I like how some sequels are prequels
02Like Tarzan 2
Or that Little Mermaid 3 movie
Yes I'm that sad of a disney hater/fan
02I've seen the beginning of it XD
04it logical and evil ^^
Why does Fu die so sadly XD
/me shrugs o3o
then Greed gets Wrath's eye XD that was epic
03sigh, headache
USA GOT PWNED
k?
and?
usa sucks
lol wut
At soccer?
derp.
02OhEspeon
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzvZz3ff8ks&NR=1
drf: what part are you on now?
6its
6a
6SA
/me 6tackles high-speed
14It's a Roara!!
its a SA roara :O
6it sa roara
6:3
A sora? :P
/me dies
6LOL
Mrr
6sora was one of my camp nicknames
XD
6skittles was first though
WUT
6which was ironic, cuz I hte skittles
6*hate
why did they call you skittles?
14I luv Skittles...
Was it become you went over the rainbow?
6lmo
6we had a skittle fight first day of camp
and thats how you got your nicname skittles?
6so many skittles got stuck in my hair and clothes, we kept finding them all through the day
XD
02I read skittles as kittens
02...
"oh look its the Skittle machine that walks! :O"
I keep watching this scene over and over again for some odd reason..
Maybe its because Father is one of the only villains that actually succedes in his plans
for 10 seconds
3 mins!
14I've always wanted to spell Roara's name like Rawra. <_< Because it has rawr in it...
then gg usa
:D
"hey RAWR"
14I'm just saying. That's how I would make people do it. XD
1 min!
/me 14hides.
lopl
onoz?
3 more mins!
:D
Then Father dies. *nod*
Father is first God, then demi-god then dies XD
02Aka: The little friend from the flask
in the anime they alwaycall him "little thing in the flask; homonculus"
02That's because those are all his names XD
02His actual name is Homonculus
02But goes as Father
LOL remember the time he mocks hohenhiem?
3 more minutes to show the world what everyone already knew?
k.
"wait..you're not to bright...maybe Hohenhiem?"
02And Hoenheim calls him "My little friend in the flask"
he is very little
he makes Pride look big
kinda ironic how Pride in 2003 kills Pride in 2009
USA GOT PWNED!!!!
I've really only been paying attention to the WC at all because of /b/ going "ENGLANDFAGS ARE BUTTHURT OLOLOLOLLLOLOLOLLOLOLLOLOLOLOL"
02Pride wasn't Pride though in 2003
02Pride was Wrath
/me pokes Quilava
02And Wrath was Izumi's kid
and sloth was a woman :O
02While Sloth was Ed and Al's mom I think
ah, well
we lost
o3o
yeah the main thing I never got with the 2003 anime, is the names
6wut
14Well I won't be reading FMA anymore... :/
Sloth isnt slothish
6...
6LOL
Wrath seems whiny XD
6Brave little toaster references the pixar "A113" joke
6well, disney I guess
hi quil :)
14Whut?
whats up?
wanna play some ? :)
Dante sucked
YES
she did
she wanted "imortality"
can't right now. need to keep up on laundry and then I have to bathe. we're going somewhere later
okis :)
though kinda funny at Ling reference during that civil war
Yessss, haha. Anyway, I'd much rather Father, though he seems kind of DBZ-ish as of late
She meant the FMA manga has ended
Shame it has XD so many things you could do with it
there's probablly a few more episodes left
14If you're counting the whole "Brotherhood" series, then I'm not talking about that.
If you keep going with something, it gets gross. *coughBleachcough*
I dont even think Bleach is even worth continuning XD
seriously, nearly..what 200 episodes have gone?
14I've only read up to volume ten in the FMA manga, and Bleach comes on too late at night for me to remember to watch it, so I almost never do. ^^;
(though that doesnt beat one pieces 400 freaking episodes >>)
02I've read all of the FMA manga
02Bleach makes no sense to me, I ask hundreds of questions about the logic behind it
though it takes a few things out of the manga
Still follows it better than the first series
like the mrs bradley talking about romantic things with King Bradley
02And I think One Piece is one of the longest mangas I've seen yet, but I still keep up to date on it
02Same with Naruto
the 1st series will never come close to Brotherhood
Naruto is almost over hopefully
I use wikipedia to make sure it is XD
02Why hopefully?
Mostly because After Pain's death
It seems boring again
Pain was like the evil person that almost revivaled Father
the only epic parts are when Sauske kills..that person of that secret organization
02Some parts can be a bit tough to get through, but I believe it's a great anime/manga
dont know of Dub yet
02For One Piece?
Yes
6so
02There's over 500 chapters in the manga XD
I check funimation to watch FMA Broherhood
02I think it's 539
6is this articuno or lugia?
XD
well their close
12Arti
12:3#
I just hope thye chose the best voice for Pride
Wrath
02Funimation redubbed it and it's much much better than 4kids lol
and Greed
6it'sablueburd
/me 6nibbles artitail
6ITS TAIL
its a blue burd at the night, during the nuclear wasteland of DC~
Brother, they've released the dub a while ago, probably not on their site
I know
I've seen the dub
though they're probablly at episode..20
maybe
Selim Bradley comes at episode 32
Pride comes in later
near the late 30s
earlt 40s
Yeah, they aren't far in. I didn't bother watching because Al's voice was disgusting
Eds voice is the same as the old anime
Yes, Vic <3 I love him, ha
thats probablly the only thing I remember XD
I remember the old Mustang
He was cruel XD remember the dog scene? XD
6this movie traumitized me when I was little
6I remember this part x-x
Sliiiightly, you're testing my memory on that one :P
"I LOVE DOG! They're the loyal, and if you are jerks to them they dont ask for a raise or demand you stop. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH"
Oooh, I thought you meant the Warehouse 13 thinger
"jeese mustang you sure are manic today"
No not that XD
Aurora: the near death scene?
12What movie Roara?
little toaster arti
the BRAVE little toaster
12Wtf
6brother, the junkyard scene
Yep
6I've been terrified of magnet lifters ever since
that scene was the moment of "ARG Not this again"
well it beats getting chased by a cow that just gave birth :|
6how the heck is this movie even called a kids movie LOL
ask Disney and their depressing movies XD
6it's so stupid to be an adult movie, but it's horribly dark for kids XD
go watch bambi, tell me you dont cry when the mother dies
6fff I cry at everything
02Maybe a teen movie then?
6although
OK dont watch Come and See
Old kids movies are so much better. They were dark and had meaning
By all that is emotional
6bambi had a silent sad scene
6I actually don't cry when the mother dies
Now a days they're all about silly things
6because there's no music
02Ff, I almost cried when I saw The Lion King
D:
Monster XD
/me dies
I cried for it was the perfect atomosphere
02Brother Bear too
6lion king still makes me cry
02No matter how many times I watch that scene I always tear up
Come and See made me cry for several reasons
1; showed dozens of people die
2; its just depressing
Homeward Bound for me :P
3; its Byelorussia during the Great Patriotic War
6hmm....while this movie is creepy, they got quite a few good voices for this song
What wont make you cry in that story?
6HOMEWARD BOUND
6FFFFFFF I was crying buckets
I have never attempted to watch that movie, EVEr since I got it
EVERY TIME SHADOW RAN DOWN THE HILL IN THE END!
for I knew I'd cry
6that yes
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFfDhXXoP0k
6but also when he fell
This scene is the most traumatic for me
6and when he stopped climbing back up
6and when sissy went over the falls
6and when she met back up
That, too!
6and when they were left at the ranch
6pretty much all through the movie XD
whats other movies that are depressing at all levels..
anyone watch dumbo/
*?
Of course
I never liked it as much
That one scene with the mom was the only sad moment for me XD
6I hate dumbo
6scared me when I was little
oh the backward history scene :D
very emotionally hatred this scene is
Not a children's film but Enough made me cry
which?
Was about this girl who was running from an abusive husband. Anyway, thry put a twist at the end that's rather emotional
ah
So far Come and See is the most depressing movie I've seen
addicting though
Flying of the Cranes semi beats it
Fly Away Home, too
wait..
People say it's stupid, but I loved it
is that the movie with the ducks
and the girl
Yesss
and the flying machine? :O
I've seen it
Based on the true story
i think I have it
6hmm
6what shall I have for lunh

02I think I found a wormhole
Paradox!
02Roara's head's underneath me, but her body is on Brother's head
:O
6it's like portal 8D
02Portal 2 *dramatic music*
But then we must get Portal guns :D
03=o.o=
/me 6shoots a portal under brother, and a portal above, sending him into eternal portal-dom
/me falls forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever..

14Green
14The Gym Leader
12o-o green?
wut u doin
14Yes.
14In HGSS
12but
12blue is such a cooler color
14That's why they gave it to a girl
/me flees
14Red is the main male character, Green is the rival, and Blue is the main female character
03You'll see. :3
12i think they renamed
12because green wasn't very common in the US
12pokemon green version
14Yeah
14In Japan, they release Red and Gree
14n
14In the US they released Red and Blue
02But then gave up when Fire Red and Leaf Green came out :P
14XD
04LoL server seems to be busy a lot these days
its summmer, thats probably why
12lol
14LOL
12Fire Red and Water Blue
14XD
12now they are making black and white now though >_>
12what odd choices
02Which will probably be renamed when they come here
02to avoid any racial remarks
14Hah
12japan has troubles as well
12no place is perfect
02except for Canada
14LOL
XD
02I already know lol
12i think some think we should invade france as well
why xD
12dunno
02My friend said that a lot of people think that Wisconsinites have a Canadian accent
12probably the same people
12who changed the name of french fries to freedom fries
12after france wouldn't get involved in the war
which war?
02But I don't like freedom toast D:
the oil war or the resources war?
12iraq
/me shall attempt to get to Mewtwo in teh dark
ah the resources war

02You guys are reminding me of so many comics XD

Well, this will be the first thing I type on my iPod with ios4
And let me tell you.
dem cocky boys
03Hi :3
If you upgrade from a bottom line iPod touch, you are getting a brutally butchered version of it.
I mean, the app store crashes every other use for gawd sake.
And no background wallpaper? Why not
02heya :3
And no multitasking? Well that ruins the whole reason to upgrade.
/me snugs
12lol
/me snugs back

04so they can try to catch santa
04then woke up in the morning and found their father or something with the glass of milk out cold by the chimney XD
LOLz
Imagine this though
02yay
02I won 6-0

Say Santa exists (I believe for reasons I can explain later which are legit)
Well
The kid druggs the milk
Santa drinks it
A bajillion kids don't get visited

TRI-FAIL
D:

the college that i want to go to has the things i want
Well if it's a landline

02you have excellent timing Drake

04how so?
02I just finished my battle on that server
/me flies off o3o
04lol
02XD
02that was record time
02well
04inb4 not trying
now I want to listen to Watcha Say o3o
02except for your first try I think
02nah
02you're good xD
04only because you basically built my team
02It's just that my team seems to counter most of yours
/me hides
02Oh how true
02But Gengar is good
02Espeon has better stats though
lol
02
04I need to give it Thunderbolt and Focus Blast instead of Ominous Wind and that other move w/e it is
04?
stop making excuses ;P
/me hides
wait
who won it?
ok
04Gengar also have a better movepool
04LL
04I suck
04I know I do
ah
04but that fact is idc
I see
02Yeah
02Gengar has a better moveset
02lolwut
better to try+fail than none at all?
02you have OMINOUS WIND in your MOVESET?
04the reason I don't play Pokemon anymore is because it's basically impossible to win with your favourite Pokemon
04gengar has good stats
04and is unpredictable
02Actually it is possible Drake
04there is so many different good ways to play him
agreed <late>
02I guess
04basically
04espeon you are stuck to maybe 1 or 2 different good ways
02Drake
04like
04infuriatingly hard
04so much so that it isn't fun
02Espeon, Lucario, Leafeon, Houndoom are my favourites
04NS
02I've pwned entire teams with them
04Dark types are my passion
02Drake
02I could probably beat you with a dark team
04yet you complain
02if I tried hard enough
04you really can't expect me to kill everyone with an all dark-type team
04when you lose to a weavile
02XD
02Point is, Drake, it is possible
04and keep in mind I'm no hardcore gamer
02Hang on
02I'll go make a dark team now
02then I'll battle you with it
04meh
02I'm going to stick Umbreon in it just for the sake of it being a dark type
02keep in mind that I HATE stalling
04most of the dark types are frail
04>_>
04of course you need a tank for support
04probably make him a mean look baton passer
02XD
04play spiritomb or sableye
http://objection.mrdictionary.net/go.php?n=4035380
04so you have someone who isn't weak to dark but in fact can not get hit by it at all

Can you use an irc client on it?
it'd be interesting if he did
Thought so
Lol
03iPhones suck as well though
03so it's not really even a point
03your arguement is "Why does everything Apple makes suck"
/me runs
and drf's response is;
7So, Lyon, got the hang of the game?
"because Apple just SUCKS"
04yup
03indeed LOL

14Beam Struggles yeh

:D YES! my friend just got me 3 packs of Silly Bands :D
04uh
04dunno
04and this game is starting to get freaky
04that's the first i've seen it happen
7Hmm?
04just watching it looked so funny XD
lol
yes
14The general outcome is that both characters get blasted
14xD
in the last few levels, it gets creepy
04i always put the same computers against eachother XD
I STILL hate those hands ><
7But the ending totally changes all of that. :D
:o
04end goku, end vegeta, goten, trunks, and frieza
04vs SS4 goku, SS4 vegeta, cell, super buu, majin vegeta XD
14SSJ4 Gogeta vs Hercule
148D
04._.
04it's pretty much team fusion
7What ._.?
04vs fusion with a bunch of computers who have specials where they blow themselves up
oh BLAH
Okay, this is bull
04ARGH HANDS
Eversion's ending...
/me shivers
lol
04i switched super buu with Tien's little friend though because the computer AI just loves spamming Genocide blast XD
14I hate characters that have suicidal finishers
7Really?
The connection rate sucks too
7It's actually kinda cute. :3
Yep
7In an eldrich way.
Oh
Not me

Quan

/me wants to smash this iPod against his wall until it's nothing but a metal case for an iPod
7Zero two?
14I'll stick to using Goku, Vegeta, Goten, Teen Gohan, Brolly and Cell :P

02And I'm tempted to use /shun but baww
14Ohai NS
/me sniffles

I'm talking about the princess in Eversion
/me randomly pokes fun at a TV ad

wb again lol
I think I know why I'm depressed now.
Facebook
/me lols
that site is evil >:|
you're depressed because of facebook?
I can't be myself there because all my "friends" would think I'm too nerdy, which I am.
That's why
and yourself would be..?
And it makes me realize how boring my life is without mentioning anuthing related to technology
ah so you're like drf
Yep
But there, I can't be
Why?
I have to be like everyone else is
So I don't hurt my image
being a mindless robot to society is a bore
but I understand the 'image' concept though I dont go by it
Well I'm 15 in a school filled with mindless jocks and very few who are like me.
I'm 15 too you know >>
The ones who are don't have a facebook profile
So I don't even know why I'm even on facebook anymore
It's useless
And that's why
Erm, how does facebook be = to you having to fake yourself out at school?
I don't know
then they're not connected
But if my real friends aren't there, then why am I?
What's the point
Because you either chose to be or were forced to
the point is something entirely different
Well, both really.
How were you forced to join a site?
let me guess for him:
peer pressure?
I chose to after one of my teachers made me join because she thought it would be good for my own social life
o.o;
wow....THAT is unusual...
I know
Then it isnt forced
your teacher gave you a suggestive
*suggestion
ARG
I dont think I need a facebook to be social, though. I have this place and about 10 other forums and 20 other websites to be who I am
Then close your facebook?
Well, I might keep it to keep in touch with an old friend or two when needed, but I will leave it for awhile and check it about every two weeks or so.
Maybe less

04oh
04:|
well...actually 2 Dante's
But I'll rent it sometime
Is it that good?
04lol
04I wanna play it
04but I don't have a 360
04that's why i asked
I've only heard that old, poem
12hmm
04well, there is a game about it
12Dante's Inferno?
Yes, I know
12looked interested
12*interesting
12not really the game you can play at church though
Not a game you can mention at the church
12i'm going to do it :D
04lol
12one day i'll walk into a church, yell "DANTE'S INFERNO"
12and run away
2o-o
kinda interesting they never do talk about Dante's poem in church
04probably because their view of 'hell' is different
I thought it was always based on a 9 circle ever since then?
oh, I'm here now. didn't see the news but I heard a bit about it. didn't realize it was that bad though o.o
2not always
what other ways did they think up hell?
2it's becoming more popular to say that "hell" is eternal separation from God
other then a firey pool of suffering
2o3o well it was originally just a giant black pit of isolation
yes, yes to place lucifier in for he had the sin of pride and wanted more
2no, just of isolation
02heya Darkhunter
02:3
Seems dull
2separated from everything
2exactly
12hmm
04I heard that the church's idea of 'hell' was an individuals worst fears being realised
2o3o that is another belief
2...
04and I thought Lucifer was imprisoned for Treachery, not Pride
04yes
04wai
04no
04I don't
large, but sure isnt unified
2o3o that's because it's really debatable what the Bible is actually trying to say
depends
do you mean the old or the new testement?
2both
2if I only meant the old testament, I'd say the Old Testament
:L
Hi
/me shrugs
2the New Testament is an entirely different situation because of Jesus's sacrifice, so there's no longer a need for "oh you sinned *zap*"
2so both
04and lol
04I saw a poster
2... what the HECK am I doing
04that a fan made
the debatability if someone wants to actually go in depth to that thing
2I was going to write about a library
2._.
2...
2LIBRARIES
Lyon: Dante's inferno or something else?
/me 2OTLs
uuugh
04I lol'd so hard
LOL
2LIBRARIES ARE WHERE THE MAFIA MEETINGS ARE FROM
/me draws Key x Tomai
04or rather
2...
2lfjiao;hgis
2ODSHOV:DJS
04Tomai hitting on Key and she's like "BACK OFF"
2THAT SAYS
The Mafia meetings?
2THAT
2KEY IS THE SEME
2OTL
04seme?
2KEY IS NOT A SEME
2yes
04what're you talking about?
2Seme x Uke is the standard
2ANYWAY
2...
04oh
04LOL
04HAHAHAHHAHAHA
2lol she wouldn't even realize he's hitting on her
04well
04he's an enemy
2ABSOLUTELY clueless
04so naturally she's cautious from the start
04so meh
04so I drew Key with relatively long hair
04otherwise she looks like a boy
2...
2............
2I got a haircut yesterday o3o
o3o
04lol
04and WOW
04I just realised something
2I always have the kind of hair that's long for a guy and short for a girl
2:B
04us three (or more you two) had a debate about Religion
2... not really
04that didn't disolve into a flame war
04milestone achieved
Not really
2._.
04well
04I classify it anyway
2I'm just saying that there's isn't one single vision of what hell is
2ANYWAY back to writing about LIBRARIES
/me 2freaks out'
04lol
2just so you know, Lyon
04?
Lyon: what do you think of that new fallout game coming out?
2It's impossible for me to do anything more than hints
04lol
04Brother: I haven't played the Fallour games so I am ambivalent
04Fallout*
2otherwise I won't be able to
it "might' be good in gameplay
04lol
04I've noticed
not so sure on story, since they decided to make this new fallout game a van buren of their franchise
04when I'm just sketching and not putting much effort into a drawing it turns out better
2?
04than if I try really hard and concentrate
2... huh
moral of lyons story; dont focus and you'll do great?
04lol

LIFE WILL STILL BE THERE TOMORROW!
You heard Pride's theme :D
02o.o
02Can I battle you though?
04fffffff

<censored>
04?
02I shouldn't have said that
02It gave me BAD memories
04waitwhat
02Made me think of literal mindrape
04I don't want to know
02Like, dreaming of getting raped or something?
/me runs
02I don't dream of that
02But
04lol
02It just made me think of it
:o
Hi b4 :)
Lyon: whats the game morrowind like?
04uh
02And some of the concepts in Reminiscence could point to that as well
04very detailed
hi.
02Such as something in chapter 7...sorta like virtual reality or something
02XD

04!readquote 20
:3
04fff
02XD
04that still haunts me
04I wonder how many times it's gone through YOUR head
I see
04also
04the main quest is LONG
04and HARD
Yeah..Oblivion's isnt..o3o;
04but the final battle is more epic
It's more tedious like
04in Morrowind it's...a letdown
04it's difficult, I'll say that
04but it lacks epicness, mainly because of the music
yeah, but then after oblivion it gets rather boring
just not enough sfx?
04and the fact that HE LOOKS UGLY
04yeah
but it has good weather,etc
He?
04there is like, 3-4 battle music clips in the whole game
04and they are used in all enemy encounters
04yeah
04the main villian
get all the mods to enhance Morrowind and it can look pretty damn impressive
04I won't say anymore because of spoilers
04Brother
04I only have it on Xbox
not sure if anyone's overhauled the final battle though
04wait
:P
04fff
04you both have the same colour text so >.<
XD
04I finished that pic
04lemme upload it
yeah mods make anything better
Lyon: oblivion isnt much better with sound XD
the old fight music gets repeative
04:|
04they need more music

02Welcome back, Arti. ^^
lolfail
wb Brother
ty

lol what word?
12lol
anyways in 09 she says "I'm a HOUSE WIFE!"
12singing
p
i
ss
ed
that word
LOL its a swear in england sorry
wb^2 Brother
02Where are you travelling to, Arti? O_o
/me is back.
Arti: HOW XD
my parents housr
It used to mean "drunk"
e
and the word hell
I'm on 118 channels, across 20 networks. I have 16 olines, 25 owners, 47 admins, 56 ops, 3 halfops, and 24 voices. I have abusive power over 725 people.
hell is never a swear :V
DRF
12arti
04wb NS
12there are cities named hell
12apparently XD
what? since when? XD
drf's mum goes nuts about the word "hell'"
more like one town
02I'm going to see my dad, older brother, and my nieces in 2 weeks. But geez! D= I am so going to be flooded with messages on DA when I get back.
!weather hell, MI

since she's a Pycho-logist
/me runs
Arti: A.D.?
02thanks
02XD
but then thats 'kid' shows
and, probably
but then kid shows various
12it's a mild swear
from mindless/stupid propaganda that has no worth or mean to exist
lol well I was told off for using it on tst forums and people replace it with stars a lot
XD
but how does peess mean drunk? Never heard it used like that before :V
thats because people seem to be so senstive
(AKA 1940)
it used to mean such
lolpoliticalcorrectness
we use it as drunk all the time here
kinda like gay?
:V
No
@brother
its common to say "we're gonna get peesed tonight "
that term has a different story
though, kinda same thing
/me plans to draw more dragons over vacation in 2 weeks
also pees means urine
I think 'gay' used to mean burning sticks or some form of that
04dragons
and then somehow got into what it is now
lingistics can be complicated
dray-gawns
02O_o
Dragooons
nice is an example of a word that changed meaning
04ovo
and ironically is used in its original way now :V
http://vimeo.com/12858526
/me listens to "Ocean Soul" from Nightwish
4:41 Am
04o-o
AM*
derp
but nice is one of the best examples
04I'm on 118 channels, across 20 networks. I have 16 olines, 25 owners, 47 admins, 56 ops, 3 halfops, and 24 voices. I have abusive power over 666 people.
most used examples as an example, that is
02XD
so basically make own server and idle in own channels
:0
02nope
or get friend to make small server
or etc
02no
02XD
more like yes
:V
02*yawns* Actually, I think I should get to bed. =_= I haven't been sleeping so well for the past week.
sleep is for the weak
stay awake like a pro
02I'd rather not. =.= I'm exhausted.
lopl
02There's some small servers
02But I don't go and idle in my own channels mostly

04soon enough this place will turn up like SW

02How likely is it for us to end up as a couple?
/me is offended and storms off
04uh
02[/torturing Drake is fun]
04dunno
02I'm sure we'll be a couple one day, if we don't fall in love with someone else first XD
04considering the chances of actually meeting IRL, plus the chances we'll see each other for an extended period of time...
04not good
02I hope you know whether I'm joking or not
and what was all that <censored> about "I'M THE ONY ONE FOR YOU" back a few weeks?
04yeah
04I know
04that
04you're joking
02It's still true ya no
04oh?
02:)
02I'm still the only girl good enough for you.
04haha
04'good enough'
04gack
04please, if I'm to get ANY girl I need really low standards
04romance
/me adverts eyes
04considering how I seem to repel anyone who comes near me
04now that is spam
02and Drake
02You ATTRACT everyone
04hahaWUT
02See it this way
02You're the negative charge
02boys are positive
02I mean
02girls are positive
04oh boy science
02see
02XD
02FFF
04loooool
02[19:31:42] <Drake> 04oh boy science
04I expected that
02that damned pun
04lol
02.-.
02And in our school magazine quotes last year
02this asian teacher was like
04!setgreet [19:31:42] oh boy science
02"Negative charge is attracted to positive charge like girl attract to boy. But there are some girl who are attract to girl and boy who attract to boy..."
02It made me lol
'ror'
04lol
02XD
04NS
04girl x boy is so much more complicated than negatives and positives
04that's just one factor
04and besides, we see plenty of people proving that factor wrong today
04I mean, really
04how would you define 'love'?
04(hey look I'm getting phylosophical)
some convoluted system I want nothing of
02Depends on HOW you want me to define it
04what do you think it is?
+=05.34.46=+ some convoluted system I want nothing of
02Do you mean the 'word' or 'feeling'?
04the feeling
02Well
02I haven't really 'felt' 'love' before
02Okay
02I'll put it this way
02Everyone's meaning of love is different
04love is just spam
/me uses /clear
02I'm guessing it's the euphoric feeling when you suddenly have a desire for someone and some side effects are lightheadedness, constant thinking about them, and generally getting distracted
02And no
02That wasn't really intended to be funny even though the way I worded it makes it sound like some disease
02Which you could put love as
02a disease
02@ Drake
04hmm
02Though really
02'Love' is very vague
04Considering that, I personally don't have a definition for it
02You can't really define love, Drake
04true
02It's a "feeling"
02It's not a solid object or thing
02It's not something you can "see" with your own eyes
04but then scientists will come up with all these theories of chemicals, hormones etc
04but I see where you're coming from
02lol
04I also find it funny that this discussion came up from you torturin- I mean joking around
02Love != chemicals/hormones
02maybe it's what causes it but it's not really what it is
02lol
02o-o
04lol
o.o
i don't "love"
unless love is the feeling i get when i make chaos, that joyful heart warming feeling i get when 300 users d/c from a server do to my spam
if that is love, then i do "love"
04oh the cliche
04Artificial Intelligence + Love = does not compute

04Ok, England have been humiliated enough, quit the replay.
;D
I like england. Some of the food may be odd, but the countryside is wonderful. Plus I know some good friends on this continent :)
04It's full of anti-social behavior, especially where I am.
not when the original shot was done. That's the only moment relevant :)
04In fact in MY STREET, and I'm not kidding, some jackass was having a cannabis farm...
lol
if you're standing right, the ball is played and one of the players can run faster than the rival, it's ok
04And as for the motto, 'Come On England' Wth? What kind of motto is that?
04Thats not motivational.
04It's like England fell flat on it's face and are being yelled at by the guy who yells at his cats.
to be honest, anti-social behavior seems to be "in" in the meanwhile. Plenty of those here, too
I mean - a man was beaten to death by three kids at a train station in Munich about half a year ago. Know why? Because he protected two girls from being robbed by those guys.
sidenote: About 50 people stood at the train station and watched the thing happening - without even calling the police
04*facepalm*
04Eitherway, we live in a messed up world.
04Where the good never did, and never will win.
really? Guess I missed that scene here.
04Oh surprise surprise
04England lost already
GOOOAAALLLL!!!!
12F***!!!!!!!!
04Don't be so surprised Arti.
now THAT was NOT offside :P
12no that was a good goal
04Well, I cant watch anymore of this torment.
04I'm gonna go on my Xbox

12:((((((((
I saw it, yes
04HAHAHAHAHA!
12They just did a replay and it went in, perfectly..
04I thought some dumbass would come with an excuse
12why do we always be cheated out of a win
12i woulden't mind if we lost fairly
04Cos Football
04SUCKS
04BALLS
12we're always cheated
04That's why
04We're full of unsporting jackasses
maybe it's just a counter for what happened in wembley. Dunno. Was definately in
12i bet someone has paid the linesman they are crooked as hell
mabe he was just sleeping or enjoying one of the south african ladies at this moment?
or he suffered a brain damage due to this constant vuvuzela-crap
04Im playing Halo
12LOL!!!!
haaah - found the second sound channel on my television transmission: They run a filter over it to get rid of this sh*t
04better than that football bulcrap
definately NOT
12XD
honestly: If any south african would be insulted because I say these things are the biggest waste of being EVER invented and should be forbidden globally - so be it
12XD
You know, all I can say is GAY
12this is so out of order - why can't we have a fair match
04Never could, never will
04Cos Football is scum of the world
04The football fans, (most of them) are the offspring of scum
04Damn right they do
04Anyway
12You shouldnt base your likes and dislikes on other people
04I just had fun
04Playing something else!
You really should've seen the major disappointment at my place when England's 2nd goal was disallowed even though it clearly went in >v>
12i don't know why we even enter the world cup - we are cheated in every single tournament
04Football should be forbidden
nah, England wasn't cheated on the last world cup
12i mean how can they be that blind?
12they must be bent.
how can a team be cheated by watching the others play?^^
12we have been cheated out of many
12remember argentina?
maybe you're calmed when you hear all the german fans think it'S 2:2 now and request more effort from the team to prove a victory from being deserved
rofl
12that is good. Germans have good sportsmanship
^
12i would be happy if we were defeated fair and square
12but if this ends 2-1 or 3-2 we will have been cheated
12that linesman needs firing
Over a foot past the line in the replay <<<
12how can you be at that level of playing and be that inept
12over a yard actually
That's what I just heard from the TV so meh XD
12bbc did a freeze frame and it was a yard
Either way it shouldn't of been disallowed
Anyway I'm off to the pub for the second half, laters all
I hope the result will be fair, too
04It wont be
04Football is never fair =3
04Im having the time of my life playing Halo
04Lmao
what other game is fair, hm?
12master cheif needs to kick that linesman's ass
04Pokemon
04Yugioh maybe
12it is a bit like tennis if it went out by almost a yard then the guy saying it was in
12or snooker and the ball hitting a red and the ref calling a foul
12it is so immensely poor it is not believable
Heya pplz~
a game is a game. As long as humans are involved, errors can happen
12that magnitude of error is not acceptable
Talking about the football match? Or something entirely different?
12if 50,000 people, germans english, everyone can see and 1 linesman cannot then he is not suitable to be a linresman
12in fact i think he saw it fine but is bent. i can't believe that he missed it genuinely
did you see the second german match in this world cup?
12no
I'd like to refer to it as "the card game"
the referee called for a foul every(!) time another player got close to another
~60 fouls in a game or so
and not a single one was a real foul
12TRhat was REALLY close..
12we're really going for it
Still remember there was a match in the last World Cup in 2006 where yellow and red cards just flew everywhere
GOAL!
12noooooooooooooooooooo
Apparently, the match turned into a mass free-for-all wrestling match
Germany
Vs. ?
England
Ah
12Ok I'm going to admit defeat now..
12xai's not
No wonder I can hear the "AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW" from my neighbours XD
Singapore's nuts
*Singaporeans
They love England more than they love our own team
game's still going for at least 25 minutes
if we count the overtime
AFTER that we can admit defeat or victory. But not before this
I don't really care who wins the World Cup anyway
As long as it's not someone who is a sore loser
*was
Italy flopped big time this year
Like France in 2002
another GOAAAALLL!
Though I could love to see England lose just to see how many broken hearts there will be in Singapore
/me RUNS
at least the victory will be clear now
and the not-counted goal is out of discussion
who is god lol
12true, but still, will ruin the mood for the rest of the day this side >> I hope not, but I think it will...

LOL SOCCER FEVER
/me RUNS
it shows just how much we suck at something half of us are pointlessly obsessed with
/me cough
12that is very true, I would have thought that England would do really well, since it is supose to be one of the few sports that the English actualy have any real interest in, that and Tennis
11 HOUR + TENNIS MARATHON MATCH

FINAL SCORE 70-68

YA RLY
"On the second day of play, the courtside scoreboard stood still at 4747 and later went dark. IBM programmers said it was only programmed to go to 4747 but would be fixed by the next day. The on-line scoreboard at the official website lasted slightly longer: At 5050 it was reset to 00. Users were asked to "please add 50 to the Isner/Mahut game score". An IBM programmer worked on the computerised scoring system until 11:45 pm to accommodate the match'
IT CRASHED THE SCOREBOARD

12Heya Andrew ;>
though i might tweak this one to select how many results to output
nowdy Andrew
and congratulations. England was a very dominant and strong second winner in this match
did you inflate him before?
i'm already deflated u____u
Deflated him too many times to count
lots of nearly-goals
14England's defense was terrible
14I left the pub after Germand scored the 4th goal
14Germany*
hey Lugia
12I don't even want to go outside..
hey, at least you lost against friends
12Everyone is going to be suicidal D:
12Yeh
lol
i actually find it funny, since i don't care about football
i was tempted to chant "VIER - EINS" when i was at work
14The England flag that I had up in teh window is already been taken down lol
12You would have had your head cut off..
12D:
ya
12All our England flags are going down.....
12LOL
14England were crap throughout the 4 games they played,
england have always been crap, apart from once 44 years ago
I forsee productivity here in Singapore, which is England-crazy, dropping like a rock tomorrow
Anyway, bed soon
i wonder how many people worked overtime during the world cup
i worked 10-5 today
was pretty dead all afternoon
12*sigh*
well performance usually has something to do with the economy
and half the staff were upstairs in the cantine watching tv
12The roads were dead too
12Easy drive down
you're in devon now right?
so I reckon if instead of watching the football, people just worked all through the world cup (afaic it's OVER now), we might have performed better
12Yeh
:)
is it hot and sunny there too?
04what
04that bot is too scary

14I'm floofy as usual
10Though it's starting to storm :<
14It's still boiling hot here
14eep
Skylanddddsss :D
just for the log: Unpacking this gz-file on my server would definately have KILLED it....
even my home-quad-core takes almost half an hour to unpack it
14I've just realized I haven't worn a short throughout this entire week </random>
14shirt*
14It's been that hot XD
upload of TST to backup site in progress
10Yeh, I've been wearing a cami all week, it's so humid
14Hot and sticky D:
10and my parents are the people who are cheapskates, so they keep the thermostat really high to save money >_>
10Then cold for winter
14x-x
Hot and sticky here as well
We actually had a severe weather warning last Friday
we had to hunker down in the basement until it passed XD
10Whenever I complain, mum says "When you start paying for it, you can change the tmeperature to what you'd like"
Running the air conditioning is expensive, though |D
10then I'm like "STFU"
10I know, but it's like a volcano here x_X
So it sort of makes sense from their point of view
Where do you live? o-o
California was like a volcano when I lived there xD It was insannnneeee
10I don't give out where I live to most XD Sorry
Oh, that's fine. I was just curious |D
10Although, I can assure you I don't live anywhere near the equator :P
14I live in England so :P
10Yes I may be over reacting about it feeling volcano-ish around here, but meh
10I naturally complain about things I dislike/hate lol
14lol
10In moderation, that is

04Heya all
It's still poisonous
D:
lol
itsa ninetales
When did explosives become a taboo/
?*
/me points to fireworks
banned in a bunch of states
um
Not here :D
astronauts breathe pure oxygen
but it's not poisonous because of the low pressure environment
They have pure oxygen spas :D
hehe
04Yup
I think those are called hyperbaric clinics
The guy who discovered pure oxygen said that it made his "breasts feel light"
/me hugs Curly
/me huggles

/me nuzzles everyone
I can make "grenades" "mustard gas" and napalm
I've never done it
heya
But it's so easy it's sad
lol
PS :D
you could make a grenade with dry ice, gravel, and two containers :o
I'll go idle now
04ok
wouldn't be very effective though >.>
You can make a grenade with C-4 :D
You can make a grenade with a tennis ball, fireworks, and a crapload of patience
:)

I've decided guitar is a painful instrument to learn
LOL SNEAS
2Roara; it definitely is, but with practice you'll make perfect
yep =)
looking at my fingers....massive pressure lines and redness
lol
I've only been at it for an hour :/
2oh, I see.
2well, all I can say is dont give up~

/me lets the fail be with her
X3
Roara, after the first 3 months, it gets better
lol
Title: 400 Bad Request
Unless you've got an acoustic, then they'll toughen up faster
what type were you referring to before?
Well, based on my experience with an electric/light gauge strings, I've played for 3 months and I can still only play for about 2 hours before I need a break'
fail ai
lol
all the electric guitars in the house are my dad's
I've got an acoustic
My dad never played his anymore, so he let me have it so I didn't have to go out and buy one. You're supposed to learn on acoustic, but ah well
yeah that's why I've got one
:)
Yeaaaah, dad-moochers, unite!
Oh wait
I just realized what you meant
Nevermind ):
lol
we;ve got like...10 guitars in the house
I'm not entirely sure if he'll actually give me this one
Oh wow... spare one for the poor?
but he gave it to me to learn on
this is actually a nice one, his other acoustic is a 12 string
03False_ai
as for the 3rd acoustic...I haven't the slightest idea where it is
12 string, wow
yeah
it's pretty intense
Wouldn't it be hard to get your hand around, too?
I would imagine
I strummed it once, just to see what it was like
all 12 strings together sounded awesome xD
14,15 Welcome to the Federation Starship SS Buttcrack.
I'd think so! It'd be so intense to play, so cool *o*
:D
14lol
Good relative evening peoples. And sorry frans of England and Mexico.
...wut
england lost?
lol fail
14Auto ID script :P
Yes, to Deutschland. (Wooo!)
/me is back
12m/e is back
Also, the loss to Germany was quite an impressive one. 4:1 (though technically it should be 4:2, but FIFA doesn't have anything to verify stuff).
I need to get all my scripts back n' shiz
13wb
but I cbb really
13Fffff
/me blows a vuvuzela
04thx
12o-o

Ironically, a friend of mine is a brass player... he managed a rather passable rendition of both the German anthem and "Moon River" on the vuvuzela.

Hehe
Proto
there
A friend of mine was paging through one of the old AN/FSQ-7 manuals on BitSavers, and after reading about the "Marginal Check Panel" asked: "So what... the purpose of these buttons are too... try and break the computer? On purpose? Why dear Jesus, why?"
had to reboot my mirc
lol
Lol, tab-fail.
14Blah to this silence D:
drf: hey

yeah I fully agree with you that DBZK is stupid XD
the english opening song is just..blah
and they make the intro better then the whole series
14Night all
/me failed
04hmm
I just checked that post on the forum in the topic
and downloaded Pokemon Online and shiz
o.o
We have a tournament script on the server
and now I'm building my team, but I can't figure out how to make Hidden Power be water type for the life of me
but there's usually not enough people
Um
Tern
well
There's an advanced thing
I understand the formula
and such
Advanced, Side Window

then you can change the type of the hidden power there

I like Pokemon Online [/wasting time doing random <censored>]

hi Shiny
SHINY
/me hugs
02hiya
02hey
Can you do me a favour?
02I guess
Post in that Pokemon Online topic
02I'm not psycic
02Just letting you know
And say that I said that we already have a tournament script set up
how's you?
02pfft
02I posted before I came on
02And said that I won't be going on there really
/me checks
02Really really warm
04o-o
because my proxy is officially retarded
proxy = retarded
fff lag
and gtfo Rover
what?
same =/
02When do you get out of school for a few weeks?
hi
soon
about a week
o.o
02My mom has the AC on but it's not helping much
but I have a camp on and I'm going skiing during that time
no auto act script back
02not awesome
oh, that kind of warm, my humid warm
so I'll be away for about 10 days during that time
12hmm
and Presea
I'm like actually burning up
I'm on CGI:IRC
oh
bleh
02No, it's really really humid here too lol
No mIRC scripts
XD
no, it's not humid here
i'm just burning up, temperature wise
Bloody hell
02For some reason a lot of people were talking a lot about the old Spyro games that
i prefer connected over proxy via mirc
connecting*
Rover can shove a dick up his ass and piss off
02I actually rehooked up my Playstation and...
02Ah I see
/me is currently pissed
/me is gonna get some dinner
02Mmk
/me wtf
02Well then guess I'm off
03o.o
D:
Sneas
03nu :<
Rover was on >>
I killed him twice
03oh
then glined him
i'd just abuse his client with my spam scripts
more fun
XD
If he comes on again
you can do that
actually
02What's more fun is saying something mean and then watching him get butthurt
I could ungline him
and you can PM spam him
heh
i could, though without oper it'd lag
:x
anyways
i need sleep
so gn

lol
XD
you could of killed him, and set a server redirect to some bad server
derp what did I miss
ohlol
Wow. I didn't even talk and you gline me. >.> I was minding my own buisness making my own channel and you gline me. I knew after that 1 kill you didn't want me in any channel, so I made my own. I don't like talking to you on email. And part of the reason I came on #true-flame was to see if you were there.
02http://i35.tinypic.com/v46wdv.jpg :D
LOL
He's an idiot
and LOL Shiny
I recognise that url
it's that no picture
XD
02Yes, yes it is
/me byebye channel o.o
Oh, hey NS
What about a tournament script?
02This is the only reason I don't like giving out my email
idk about my email
I only use it for newsletters and signing up for stuff, really
02I only use it for signing up on stuf
02stuff*
Yeah
it starts a tournament on the server
Ah
that people can join via /join or !join
02Even in competitions, when NS says "Email such-and-so to Shiny and me" they STILL only send it to NS
I was thinking of some official type of tournament in the forums
Yeah
I've seen how it works before
I was thinking of that
But we need moar people first
Something spread out over a few weeks
You should make it so it's disqualified if it's only sent to NS
and Shiny
I intend to make the email philosophy@ho-ohrealm.net
that forwards to both our emails
btw
Can someone send me the text color script?
because I am far too lazy to look it up
and also have no idea where I would look it up XD
Hm?
02You go to the magical fairies and ask them to paint your text for you
OKAY.
/me skips off happily~
02also
LOOOL.
o.o
02Also because this is HoR I have another comic I can show and not worry about NSFW crap
14Really, screw this heat...
02Ugh I know .-.
14I'm in serious need of sleep -v-
/me is back
14Blah to this weather
02wb
14Also apologies in advance if I snap at anyone ._. got quite a short fuse, I've had less than 20 hours sleep in the last 3 weeks :|
Rover is annoying
No <censored>
02on the first statement
02.-.
thanks Shiny ^^
02np
14No just stupidly hot and humid
/me gives everyone an umbrella
12comes with an installed shower that you can't turn off
14and the fact that my pillows and sheets are sticking to me when I move, it's a perfect sign that it's too hot x-x
02I shouldn't even be on
14I should be sleeping
14:<
02Get a fan
o.o
14Haven't got any, and have no money to buy one
14Got no AC either
14I'm practically living in a oven right now
If Rover comes on, gline him
02I'd say sleep in the basement but you probably don't have one, or it's not as "luxurious" as ours
ident is fl
14I live in an apartment
host is ip98-166-241-195.hr.hr.cox.net

14But I don't check my emails
he doesn't know your email lol
14You never know
14but anyway brb, need a source of coldness
he's not smart
/me hides
02That one in the yellow with the red things coming off its face is pretty cool
02Though a few of them I went "wtf" at
ugh, I hate it when my sheets do that to me -.-
12at least your bed doesn't smell like hospital
10Yeh, he's the only cool one
o.o
14Meh

14Already had that done
and then pull it out after a while and rub it on your forehead
Oh okay.

You should prolly make Shiny an administrator as well
or moderator, w/e
up to you
I really don't mind
ask Shiny
04i thought shiny said she had no intention of coming
14He*
14:P
/me lols

He?

I remember that
yeah :/
14Greedy money grabbing scum that company
14Oh well, not like I care much anyway
14I speak to everyone I played Mabi with here so
10Mabi looks so similar to Runescape lol
it isn't XD
It's really different
14You would actually take that comment back if you played it
14lol
10:P
Runescape is <censored>

^this
14Mabinogi is awesome

10That's just discriminating of sexual preference tbh
10whoever did that is dumb
14eh
14I dunno
It must be the default thing for the censor script or something
or some dimwit requested it added at some dumb point
10I wonder if b loody is censored lol
bloody
14No it isn't
did that censor?
10Nope

And he responds to his fans/insane fanboys all the time
12what about critics?
12you know
He just deletes those XP
12the ones who are actually polite
12not like drf
Or doesn't respond
LOL
12ones that actually give advice instead of saying "YOU SUCK!"
He is currently responding to thousands who are complaining about iPhone 4 problems with the signal.
03OK, so my advice then
03"Stop sucking"
/me runs

04fff
6oh no
o.o
04I can't believe that The Lion King gave me two ideas for my FF
g2g ;.;
6probopass evolution o-o
02yeah, my schedules was messed up
I love how they're overcomplicating pokemon even more
02schedule*
wat
Roara, if you think the new Pokémon suck, well
6it sure looks like it
/me gets into the same boat as Aurora
6look at that color combination
not even nosepass needed an evolution
02I would stay up all night then go to sleep in the morning an then wake up in the afternoon
:V
oh :(
TRIPLE BATTLE
13Well, that's good Lyon :3
that explains it a bit...
Next thing you know, they are going to have six-on-six at once
but anyway, I g2g
02Well at least the evolution gives Probopass a reason to get
04hurr
:(
/me shot
13Cya LL
03next thing you know there's going to be over 9000 at once
02...
/me hides
04cya LL
:V
02I'm not too fond of the evolution though XD
I'm talking on a non-player basis though, I don't care about your stats and EVs and all that stuff
13Gaaah....
04?
02I don't either .-.
02guys
13Just having a fight with myself
13Yes?
02wb
The graphics and online play capabilities seem to be the only reasons for getting this game thus far
/me 2just realized that both those pictures are flipped OTL
you whippersnappers and your EVs and stats and tiers (TR4Q), back in my day pokemon was battle to win against the elite four and then you basically did nothing with it for the rest of time
graphics pfft
13o3o The Faries are ALWAYS watching
02^this

04i want to go there so badly XD
02Drake
02join the tournament via /join
04this doctor themed burger joint who names his burgers after heart surgeries because you probably are going to need it after you finish the burger
04?
02nwo afk
04I don't really want t
04to*
02come on xD
02I'm not in it
04too late
12why do you think its called a bypass burger
12you are going to need the surgery after you eat it XD
XD
12actually that is a real burger from this real burger joint i'd love to go to
12it's a doctor themed place basically you either order or you can have your appointment with the doctor and he'll check your vitals and tell you what to eat
12and as you noticed all his burgers are named after some sort of heart surgery
12the best part is that they walk you out of the building in a wheelchair lol

Quantum Physics is a <censored>
02and so is string theory
02god damn philosophy
Quantum Physics is not a bad thing.
04np;\
04ffff
04freaking up key
04:|*
02o.o
02well it's annoying, Xeli
02especially when you have to 'accept matter doesn't exist'
02which I don't get the point of
02I don't have an opinion of matter anyway
02and when you get down to string theory
02and you find that people believe everyone/everything is made of tiny vibrating strings of energy
02and a calculation that solves everything
02you go 'wtf how can a maths equation solve everything as well as determine extra dimensions'
02so woo, my mind is on a rollercoaster
well I find it fascinating
how everything is determined on a scale that we can't comprehend
02and hensh was like the other day "I don't really care about my physical wellbeing so long as I have a healthy mental state" or something like that
02I think particle theory makes moar sense
04..wut
02and whee, bouncing fabric of space and strings that can HEAL CUTS IN IT YO
/me sticks to the fantasy theory kthnxbai
/me shot
02lolwut
02that typically IS fantasy
02in a way
02but it hasn't really been proved
02and that large haedron collider that's supposed to make a black hole if it works
02just makes me wtf
02it makes sense at least
it's supposed to recreate the big bang among other things
02but seriously, are people trying to kill everything in the name of SCIENCE?
well the world didn't poof when they started it
02yeah but apparently there's a theory that the big bang was created by the dimensions going bang against each other
02and it happens every now and then or something like that
04[19:31:42] oh boy science
02so wonderful
02I personally don't find it that funny, Drake, lol
there's so many theories
02course there's a lot
02but that's kinda crazy
04like plenty other things I turn unfunny
02I still like the idea that we're 3 dimensional creatures and can only see things in 3 dimensions
well I do think there's more than one universe so Â¯\(Â°_o)/Â¯
4 dimensions if you count time
herpderp
02well yeah, 4 dimensions
02but then there's other stuff that can see in 5 dimensions etc.
04._.
02More than one universe makes sense
02string theory does not
well too bad our brain can't comprehend more than 4 dimensions then
02yeah
well it stops being logical once you enter the realm "quantum physics"
that's why it's not just "physics" |D
/me shot
02true
02walking through walls would be fun
02but technically
being able to watch everything would be better
04Omniscience?
02Quantum physics is alright
02I don't like string theory that much though
02I find the idea of AUs alright
lolol
02but really
I actually find the whole theory that every choice creates alternate universes quite interesting.
whoever comes up with random <censored> about OUR universe is a loony cock
infinite universes = the word "x doesn't exist" is invalid
02ok
02disregard that
lol WUT
02I'm ranting
02BUT
02there's stilll some really retarded theories out there
02compared to them, string theory actually makes sense
02well
02not really
02but there's also this quote "If you think you understand string theory, you don't"
02which I think would be quite true
the theory that the world is an advanced computer simulation is weird.
02but then again
and that is quite true
04for some reason I had an idea in my mind that every thought in our minds creates a new dimension or something...
02Drake
Well that's pretty much what I said
02Apparently that's one of the theories
but better elaborated
04:|
02Every choice you make creates an alternate dimension
universe
02in which you would have made a different choice
02well
02universe yeah
02AU
02which is an alright statement
tl;dr there's a world where Hitler won WW2, a world with dinosaurs and even a world with <insert anything here>
because infinity really screws up logic
02yep
04ah
04well
02that's sums it up really
04this entire convo is screwing up my mind
02Drake
04so I'm just gonna idle
02you DON'T do philosophy like I do
02hell, I don't even know why I took the class in the first place
04no
04I don't so philosophy at all
but it rapes your mind so <censored> hard it's not funny
04do*
02Anyhow
02That also reminds me of time travel
04my school is catholic
04Religion replaces Philosophy
02apparently the further you go
LOL
In Norway that sort of schools = illegal
04great
i never understood why. they try too hard xD
It's fun when the parties that rule have wildly different meanings on immigration
04lol
really, they're obviously forced to find a compromise but one of them basically want to lock down Norway while the other is like "Come to us! Our country is a refugee camp!"
02o_O
02lolwut
and then they want to put a ban on ethnical clothing in public services and stuff
DRAMA
sleeep well
04I have a feeling this convo will spill into my sleep

12o-o
12i still don't know if i want AVG or Avast
I prefer AVG myself
10I wish I could get back into the TCG :/
Avast is too... simplistic
it's just like one giant scan button XD
AVG gives you more options
also be sure to get Malwarebytes for any heavy stuff
12heh
12hijackthis
12was complex
lol
/me now belongs to Espeon for 15 minutes
and why not get back into it? o.o
hijackthis doesn't actually fix your computer though
all it does is show you what's running and stuff
also yes
12i know
12but who wants to do that
10well, it costs money to collect the cards
LOL indeee
d3
10I'd rather be spending it on other things
04not if you use a program like redshark
well true lol
04XD
o.o
what is that
12i guess one thing that irritates me with avast
well merp gtg
12is that everytime it gets a really important upgrade it makes you restart
04i mean what i mean
heh
I didn't use it long enough for that to happen
04http://pokebeach.com/tcg/redshark
10I don't mean to actually play though lol
/me just collected the cards
12what about AVG?
04oh
AVG only made me reboot twice
in the past year
14AVG sucks
orly
it's better than Norton and McAfee
and Avast is just eh
14No it isn't
my work uses Trend Micro, but that's kinda retarded
it blocks my flash drive and say sit's a virus >_>
because I use autorun
to give it a custom icon and whatnot
14Norton and McAfee are a TON better than AVG >>
EWW
no they aren't
14Bs
AVG works about 95% of the time, that's better than most stuff I've seen
McAfee is a plain failure
It lets viruses by and blocks everything else -_-
12i think
12out of all the people i asked
14AVG Killed my laptop at one point
LOL
12everyone said AVG sucks
12except DRF
ATI killed my desktop at one point
but everyone says ATI is good
so like
yeah
12apple killed my computer at one point
LOL
14AVG deletes files that aren't infected
yes, but you can get them back
and I'd rather be safe than sorry
12drf no joke
14Tell that to my laptop
McAfee deletes them *permanently*
12i used to have an ipod
AVG just puts them in a virus vault
you can restore them
14McAfee gives you an option
14>>
orly?
no it doesn't
14Yes
not the new one
12it glitched on me one day so i thought it had something to do with the batteries so i plugged it into the laptop and itunes just wigged out
14It does
we had it at my work last year
I plugged in an external hard drive
12since that day
bam, half the drive got deleted
14It's a setting
12my systemtray has permanently vanished
14Wow drf how fail are you :|
yeah but if you're not an admin
and the computer has McAfee
you're f***ed.
14...
12until i reinstalled windows lol
point being
no antivirus is perfect.
12that's why
14Antiviruses are just useless anyway
12you download and install 3 Antiviruses :D
14I don't use any of em anymore
LOL no
I disabled AVG LOL
It's just there as an on demand scanner
as is Malwarebytes
it's nice to ahve them installed, but not running
12i dunno
so don't do that XD
12avast has helped me plenty of time with its realtime scanners
so has AVG
12like when websurfing and blahblah
but I got mad at one point because I got a keygen that kept getting deleted LOL
so I shut it off
easy way: find a keygen that doesn't get deleted, or even better, a key.
12yay
12so much for AVG
12it's worrying more about your software being legal
12instead of being safe from viruses
LOL
12its like your mothr
so I just shut off AVG's realtime scanner
12*mother
and never bothered to turn it back on

/me hides
/me humps Sneas
04lol Quilava
hm?
04funny thing happened, >_>
04i'm sitting here near the end of the match
04the person i laned with was a gangplank
hi and ew - still no Cuno here
04and he complained about someone stealing his kill
04guess what
04my record was 4/2/12 because of him XD
lol
04i love that irony
she was here earlier looking for you XD
04the guy who took like 8 or 9 kills from me
04complained about 1 kill being taken from him
SOUNDS AWESOME
04i didn't care
04i just laughed it off
...
...and I was at the airschool
learning to fly...well....all the technology so I'm allowed to
though he could have been trying to get a new highest kill count
learning how an altimeter, a turn indicator and such works
but still
04i'm starting to get used to nasus
04he is just mean as heck
04the fact i can easily dragon at 6
04wither and spirit fire
good for teaming I suppose
04spirit fire has so many uses
04keeps them away from farming while helping you farm as well
:o
good vs ganking groups too
04perhaps
its got a pretty large area
04wither has a LARGE area as well
is it AoE?
04no
04i'm just saying it has a lot of range
thats what I meant
hey Ari ^^
04i know
04really
04the only problem i have with Nasus is that i'm never sure when to whip out the ultimate
that goes for almost anyone though.
just get cooldown reductions so you can use it more often
04not really
04i mean look at teemo
ALMOST anyone
04i think nasus is among the hardest though
use it when the enemy is slowed/stunned? or when they will be?
2 o-o
04i usuall use it for defense
04like if i think i'm going to die, i whip out the ultimate with hopes of surviving
doesn't work well against anything with range though
04i wear boots of swiftness
04plus i usually get zeal mid to late game
wb quil :P
04to help build trinity forc
04*force
04then i have wither, with that build, nasus has plenty of escape options
04then to be even more safe i equip clense
/me pokes Quilava
04that has helped me out of so many tight spots
04:3
/me runs
04of course run, like you always do :(
hi

/me blinks
<.>
you feel like playing a match or 2 now? :)
just say if yes or no :)
04i think they shut off 5v5 battling for a few minutes
5vs5 queue is up again :P
they do that
04plus the server status is busy lol
oh.
well if I can log in I'll play
04good luck Quilava
04show them what you are made of :P
dot. server is unavailiable?
oh
wow yeah its really busy
strange
im on :P
04i guess they like european people more :P
it took the patcher a minute or two to register that it was actually online
and it doesn't effect anyone who's already online.
i gues i was online BEFORE the log in server was busy :P
it just doesn't allow more to connect
aaaaaa
anyone wanna talk?
im 12
ill wait a few more minutes
04does the server status
04err how do i say this
04is it keep upto date
04or does it have to be shut down and started up again to see new status
the patcher doesn't update it automatically
04ok
04thx
maximum upload rate?
/me :|
:(
still trying
ill just wait a little longer, if you wanna stop - let me know, then ill go and try to kill the cat-dragon on monsterhunter 3 :P

maybe its just luck then >.>
04When I watched this video, the person told me to imagine this problem I had, wrote it on a journal, crumpled up that paper with the problem and put it in the fireplace
Was about to do Oblivion LP but with a storm I dont want the computer to blow up in my face
like the server is marked busy if X people are online
04And when that feeling came, I thought I was laughing in an evil way
dont think so
"throwing paper in fire; another way to the dark side?"
so i'm just going to watch Deus Ex
it was only ever busy/unavailable if they are restarting or have troubles with it
*were
04No, I just imagined banishing my stress into the inner pits of Hell.
me is in :P
usually 'busy' means.. the server is busy
04Then again, it could be
just dont sing hellfire then
04I kinda had the background music of Hellfire from Hunchback of Notre Dame in my mind as well.
:p
04WHA!!!
04Brother, you mind-reader!
04How did you-----But I----Did you---?

Now plz change your nick
my netbook screen has optimized tiny xchat
14.
14Seriously that isn't helping
14also for those that actually care my server is back up and running
14irc.starlightdragon.co.cc 9001
disabling is exactly the same as just leaving your account alone
14Delete waht account?
If you want it to actually go away, you have to delete it
facebook.
which is sort of convoluted
14I disable it
and yeah.. 'disable' is the same as 'log out and don't come back'
14Yeah Quilava
14I'll do that
Everyone can still see your page and stuff
DELETE the account
14Facebook pisses me off anyway
here, since it's sort of hard to find where you actually delete your account, I'll give you a link
you can google it. there's like a million walkthroughs for it
ever since people found out they sell your personal information
14Guys I really don't care :\
I don't know the situation, just randomly looked over here and thought I'd try to help sort of xD
14I really couldn't care less if my facebook was deleted or not
14Chances are I will be leaving the internet for a while anyway :|
how come?
Good relative evening peoples.
14I dunno
14I need space
14I guees
hmm :/ ok
14My Dad really hit me where it hurt today so yeh
14Though meh
14He is going to regret it
D:
/me hugs?
/me hugs back
14To be honest
14At this current point
14you guys are my family
14Though chances are that I will completely give up on the net
eh?
how come?
14I just don't have the mental capacity to care for the internet anymore
:/
14I've had so much crap from my family
14I can't deal with it anymore
14I know my own Dad completely disowned me
14But he blamed me for something
14Something that really damn hurt me
<censored> it
sorry to hear about that :(
><
04sigh he doesn't see the contradiction in his logic
nobody does.
04if we are like family to him
14OMG
14BEST PIC EVER <3
04then we are like best friends as well and in a situation like that, friends is what you need the most
Apparently, the server with the SSL connection dropped on me...

o.O
:D
Hey
Oh yeah, that reminds me
Did I tell you guys about the guy who was asking me to make him an oper?
it was weird
XD
Was it dlsabi?
:P
No
Some guy named SID
*djsabi
SID
hmmm
He had an... interesting way of speaking
example?
I'll see if I can find the log
But first he was like, "how do i ircop?"
/me snuggles against Quilava
anything I could do to help you feel better?
And then he was all "awwww"
O.o
LOL
wtf
And I was like "...no"
14Not really no :<
:P
:P
it's like those people on youtube that PM you and say "can i borrow your account? i need to see something"
o.O
Yeah, who do they think they're fooling
people don't just give their passwords out
apparently, a lot of people DO fall for it
which is pathetic
:'D
wow
aww
"but it's important please"
Yeah, because I'm totally going to give some random dude I've never even seen before control over a good portion of the network
14SHOULD have a RL friend coming on
14very soon
That makes perfect sense :D
I can has password?
:P

I wouldn't ask you to go against your honor
I shall duel thee for it!

that sounds good
^^
wow, what a weird individual
this coming from someone who is also a weird individual
reminds me of those pakistani people
Hahahaha
they were cooler though
speaking of which
I wonder if they're still around...
14If he wasn't so IRC dumb LOL
[18:19] ->> You were removed from #funnypaki : Bad channel key (+k)
:O
Does that mean they banned me?
lol
heh
to make you an oper where?
This guy wanted to be a network oper methinks
Woah
Lot of people today

It was a query
darn
lol
thought that may work
terrorist channel?
probably some word in their language you'll never guess
yeah probably
14Everyone is being rude!
/me shot
I've seen plenty of interesting words
RDX: yeah that's the one :D
lol and how so
kind of odd that after we all start joining they set a key
=/
14Everyone is quiet D:
squeak
lol, they really just wanted a private channel for paki people
for what reason, I dunno
obviously
:P
:P
I forgot
I almost got to help set up the demo game consoles at work today
lok, I'm still in there
Woah cool
Don't tell me what I have to love!
I would love that job
RDX: Can you decipher the password
:P
prolly wouldn't go over very well lol
:P
we had a group of like 4 people doing that
besides it's prolly just Allah Haffiz or something
Yeah, probably not
XD
Allah Ackbar
yeah
or something along those lines
But a supervisor told me to let the men to it :(
:(
0.o
SEXIST!
lol Wal Mart
:P
I work alongside a Minnesota equivalent of you RDX
And they had no idea what they were doing so it took them like an hour
XD
XD
ironic
I bet you would've been able to figure it out way faster
probably lol
12hmm
And keep in mind this was with step-by-step instructions
XD
XD
It's simple really
I saw them still there like an hour later
/me balances on it
red cord goes to red slot
white to white
etc.
well, it was a little more complicated than that
there were a few extra cables and stuff
for the controllers I guess
yeah
since they can't be wireless
And some thing called a "Medusa"
whatever that is
Hmm
It turns those who can't set it up to stone
hence the reason they took so long
:O
what dare I ask is a Minnesota equivalent of me?
The Coke vendor
lol
he comes in every week
12the lettuce smells like cookies
must be a convenient store
like this morning for example
All Coke vendors are RDX
:P
nah, Walmart
then he should be in there every day
ohai new person 8D
not once a week
oh yeah
he probably is
/me tacklehugs the new person.
Wal Mart would have a heart attack if a Coke vendor only showed up once a week
14XD
I never pay much attention because I don't directly work with him
lol, true
and no
even in a small town
if all vendors would me then they would look better
lol
12and cheesecake
maybe the one I work with is good looking
I dunno
and so it begins XD
O.o
why not?
12it's special grown lettuce o-o
I'm not one who knows these things
okaaayyy then XD
14Orly
14:P
typically it will be different vendors as part timers
and one full timer
/me blegh...
who does the orders
I'll have to ask a female coworker if he is
while part timers work weekends
as a great creature once said Pikachu pika pika
"Is the Coke guy hawt?"
I'd look crazy
"omigawd ya like totally"
not feeling so good all of a sudden ><
lol, all my female coworkers are like 60
XD
LOL
OK, maybe not then :P
^_^
there are a couple younger ones I think
all the ones I see all the time are old though
literally everyone on my team smokes
too bad 95% of the chicks in my town are ugly bats
except for one other person
Hahahaha
RDX: XD that does suck
It's the same with the nightshift crew it seems
they're all ugly bats or they all smoke?
smoke
and probably ugly bats
haha
but they can't help that
they're too old
::P
:::::P
Mine has more eyes than yours
Lol, I've created a new typo craze
Mine has gla censored cat sses
Why does Wal Mart put the people with the worst looking teeth as greeters?
LOL
LOL
I dunno
seriously
it disturbs me
here they just give that job to the handicapped
Because old people have bad teeth
I never noticed their teeth
not just old people
And only old people ever work there
actually
I've noticed the older greeters looked better then the middle aged ones
they all have black crooked teeth that look ready to fall out
how lovely
Maybe it's because they smoke
probably
because all Walmart employees smoke too
I swear 95% of people who work for Walmart smoke
Why, I have no idea
it really does seem that way
D:
the door greeter job must be so boring
they have to clean the windows too
just stand in one place for 4 hours at a time and say goodbye to people
but yeah, that's still not much to do
And stop shoplifters occasionally
Sup
hey
Speaking of Walmart shoplifters
The other member of the walmart crew has arrived
hi infa z
Infamous, I'm gonna start working on an anime version of a CBL during my lunch breaks
course i dunno how walmart is gona smile upon me after my long absence
huh?
whats going on?
It's gonna talk about using PPE and using the Open Door policy and all that
but it will be anime
lol wtf
so it will be very over dramatic about it all
ha
this was a random idea he had while driving me home yesterday
don't ask me :P
lol, and after thinking upon it more it seems genious
it would be funny
Lol, it's impossible to track my train of thought
that just brings phinox right up into my head
even for me
but you have to get the expressions right
/me bored
That will be the hard part
Really super overdramatic

he should do it
14Just as well I have a backup mouse :>
he does when hes lazy

14You know
She isn't even open to criticism
14That actually makes no sense at all
which makes her a hypocrite
I use a trackball mouse... when I type I prefer to use both hands on the keyboard at once.
14Ewwwwwwwwwwwww
14Mouse Trackballs
12for gaming
12it makes perfect sense
14Get a laser mouse yo

Tracakball as in a "thumb trackball" as it takes up less desk/thigh space. (Stupid aircraft/cars... with no space.)
Apparently our lives will become litter boxes because we don't like twilight

it's not that bad

Confusion is relative... I can understand what one says... however I cannot for the life of me understand this error message.

i assume your spastic half the time
lol
while the cool ass stepdad prepares bacon and fish sandwiches

14My laptop is overheating
04heh
14D:
04i'm thinking of using other computers
14brb REALLY need to boot up external fans
holy crap... i can breath through my nose now... and it feels like an ice cube is going up my nose
04to make a team of 5
04who just sit around and do nothing until the other team wins and get quick losses and experience
hahaha
I hate that
it'd be faster if you had them bot, and fed the opponents
/me can't breath through his nose at the moment
:(
Well, not very well at least
me either
04the account i want to level up
14Booting up external fans
04will do that
I think I'm alergic to all the dust at walmart or something >.>
Yeah
04so it doesn't get booted for being idle
I was thinking that too
if i would close my mouth every hole in my head would be stopped up right now
or in my case all the cleaning chemicals
yay, home \o/
04i'll even setup a timer for when i can surrender
14Even the heat in my place is making my laptop overheat :\
04so when the timer reaches 0 i'll just make a surrender and vote all users yes
the one for the scrubber makes me lightheaded whenever I smell it
weeeeeeeeeeeee
that would require you knowing how to script
propane...
04not really
ew
Action Replay Isteo
04because most likely the other 4 computers will get DCed from being idle
woo
going to rain tomorrow too probably
04so i'll only need 1 vote of yes

Oh lol
Why are you over here now?
:D
Hi there!
just checking the chats out
Granted I don't disconnect, I'll be here for 10 minutes
Oh and even though I may have lost the bugs and fish I should still have the fruits and net :)
12lol
didn't know about this 'til now
So what's up.
12not much
Well what's down? :p
ah glad ya got to keep something at least! :)
Anyways...
Hi Ari
I made another game channel XD
:D
12me almost
12you?
Eh, I'm tired but fine overall
Mother Fu-
Oh I'm back
Yeah
I dc'd again
Oh sh
12watch the mouth D:
O_o
I
I wasn't here
I don't even know anymore
12oO
It's purty dead though
/me gives it a pheonix down
I don't know what I'll do with this iPod now that this thing is unreliable for irc
12there is always finding a way to make it better
03smash it.
I don't really have the time to complain yet.
Give it some members lol
iPods in general suck
/me goes to bed now
Well what's your alternative, genius?
Answer me!
Don't you fall asleep on me!
Alternative?
A computer maybe
/me DEFINATELY goes nows
xD
Um, that won't kill my eyes at night and has a decent battery life
My current laptop is a powerhouse with an i5, ATI radeon 5750, and 4GB ram.
And gets only 2 hours
And I spent those 2 hours watching a webstream with another irc client
How about a portable alternative that I can sleep with.
03Droid/
/me hides
Like right now, I'm resting in bed
12Droid is the best alternative
I still have another year on my contract
AT&T
And it's a crappy free phone
With an even worse touch screen than any iPhone.
Capacitive, as technical minded people call it.
That's the iPhone
And the other kind is transistive, that's like the ds
And that's my phone
03off to bed
Besides that, I don't think my parents would even pay any more than 30 a month for a phone.
Even though my dad wants a droid >_>
03Droid IS 30 a month
03anyway
03bed
I guess I'll get to sleep
Everyone only has voicestuffs? :o

indeed XD
bought any explosives? :P
heck yes
about $60 worth
not to mention I entered 5 contests
Ro-ro-ro-roara
ONLY $60?
We usually spend like $250 on fireworkd
s
a year
:)
XD
two of which were to win one of the finale boxes, worth about $700
oh
k
one was for a truck
14I'm not getting many fireworks this year. :(
and two were for other sets, one at $99 and one at $139
a truck explosive Aurora?
so, if my luck can be good for just ONE day
I'll be the happiest person alive
drf, we usually spend 200-250 as well, but I'm also buying this for myself
my family is gone for 2 weeks
oh XD
/me 6has purple rains <3
4th of july, or rather known as "use explovies to your hearts content" day :P
14I remember getting the cops called on my family for Independence Day.
6pretty much lololol
6we have cops who JOIN our block party
XD
6mainly cuz one lives across the street
We have cops who'd arrest us :P
6but off-duty cop friends join as well
14We got them called on us for shooting fireworks in the middle of the night, though!!!
6stupid lolol
well there was one cop friend right acorss the street
but she moved
the rest of the cops hate my guts
14Why?
Because I exist
:p
14:(
cops don't like me much either
they hate people who like 4-wheelers
14They get used to that here.
and who drive in in their space? p
i got screamed at for riding on a road once XD
14Because almost everyone owns one. XD
not funny at the time, but now i'm like "whatever, I just wanna drive my wheeler"
strange how I'm barely eating anything today
/me gives Brother a steak
14Maybe you're just not hungry.
its 2 pm
14I just ate breakfast. :PP
I got up an hour ago XD
14same here
6lol my parents
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zX09WnGU6Z <-- EW MACS
but that's cool
6they saw my facebook status about fireworks
6"don't blow up the house...by some extras for us"
LOL
and hm
6SURE THING 8D
do you use your real name on FB? o.o
6yes
weird
6why
because I was bored one day
went to Articuno's friend list
searched your first name
6...LOL
nothing
6..
XD
6what day?
it it like superuberprivate or somethign?
um, a few weeks ago
6no, I don't think so o-o;
10I found Roara's through Arti's xD
it showed 3 people but none of them looked anything like you XD
6LOL
not to mention two lived in teh UK
the other was totally private
6lol teh
hm
Teh Britannia :P
I'm not a stalker, i was just curious :P
10Can I add you on FB, Aurora?
oh sure you say that DRF
/me hides
14Oh, Facebook...
6no, I don't add people on here to my facebook for very plain reasons
6Arti is an exception I'd rather not explain
curioisity kills the...internet person?
10k
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zX09WnGU6ZY&feature=player_embedded <- fixed video link
and eh
why, just because you only add IRL people?
6brb, calling clark pest control x-x
14Don't kill it! D:
6drf, because my parents would chop my up and feed me to the rats in my attic if they learned about me being online like this lOL
6they're very anti-chatroom
LOL
do you have to tell them it was a chatroom though?
also, this is why not having your parents as friends on Facebook is useful
/me runs
6how else will I explain like 20 people from random parts of the country
forum?
6they already asked about aRTI
6Arti
my parents just don't care anymore
14How did you explain Arti?
14same here
just be like, "I'm an adult, I do what i want"
6she was a friend of a friend of mine who was visiting the country
6worked decently enough
LOL
14witty
10Parents checking your Facebook is kinda sad tbh, but eh
07lol
do they actually look through your friends list on a regular basis? o.o
6it wasn't checking like "lets make sure she's safe"
10ah
6they saw one of arti's comments that said "YOU'RE A PEAAAAAAAAAADGE LOOOOOOOL"
6and basically went wtf
XD
14still kind of creepy
14I'm fifteen and my parents don't even care that much. :/
6yeah, I have to be careful what I say -_-;
my parents basically said they'd ban me from the internet if I made a Facebook
so I made one
and didn't tell them
XD
eventually my mom found out like a year later and was like w/e
6._.
14My parents ENCOURAGED me to make a Facebook!
now my mom let my 13 year old sister make one
6ok, they let you hack computers, chat online, and be an expert pirate
she got more friends on there in a single day than I have total >_>
6but you can't have a facebook?
they don't know I can hack
they don't know I pirate
6LOL
and they finally shut up about the chatting after two years of nagging me
6well ok then

..what did Califorina want to be West Texas>?
6well, California is a massive ag state
6it's only SoCal that got the whole place stereotyped
6SoCal and SanFran
I think thats the only thing our states have in common XD Most of Texas still really isnt city like
just go 4 miles from my city you already reach the country side

14I don't know, Roara. Flies are pretty useless, too...
/me hides

so are drf's :P
/me runs
6flies are easy to catch and feed to my venus flytrap
bob?
6mosuitoes are small and when you finally see one, you've most likely already been bit
6his name is Fred >|
/me 6needs chips and salsa
You should have named him Bob :P
You should put an "Al" before the "fred"
it'd be such the hilarious fallout reference
6fred is cooler
14Fred is an awesome name for a Venus Flytrap.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO3dhWHrNeM
OMFG
"He's name is Bob, and he's a tree on mah Head :D"

6dude
6drf
6that's like the best thing i've ever seen
I KNOW
I need to organize one of those at my dorm
6freaking japan
I'm just curious where the red lights came from
6I've seen a red light room in my area
6every time I come home from work
heh
but the rooms change from red to white
14When I live in a dorm, I'm going to put bright blue lights in it just to confuse people.
6this room does too
http://epicwinftw.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/129162776379082002.jpg <-- LOOOOOL
I wanna do that
and o.o
6I guess they must have one red and one white bulb
you can turn your room red? Why?
hm
6HOLY CRAP V-MAX
that looks... vertical
6only, OPEN
V-Max?
6drf, I've ridden a slide like that
6it was called v-max
14SOMEONE must have fallen off that thing before...
oh
6most epic waterslide ever
/me OMFGs at DRF's pic
I wanna ride one
6 9 stories tall, near vertical drop
NICE
6guarenteed wedgie at the end
XD
otherwise you get your money back? XP
14I would never ride anything like that...
same XD
hi Aero
hai J!
I would! XD
14It looks like someone could fall right off!!
6SA, I said that for the longest time
6until my mom managed to get me to climb up to the top with her
6I chickened out and then realized something
http://epicwinftw.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/129159992359987275.jpg
6I'd have to climb 9 stories back down
6or spend 4 seconds sliding
6the slide was way more fun once you got on XD
14Yes, but I'm afraid of falling...
6the one drf posted was open though...
Aurora: tha reminds me of NRH2O
6v-max was closed for the first half of the slide
only I didnt know how tall this ride was
6the second half was open
oh
open
I thought you meant like
open for business
I get what you mean now XD
you'd have to go up some 10 sections of stairs
so it was nutoriously the longest waiting line in the world
/me omgs
i could imagine XD
but worth it, down virticully and go in all different directions
/me 14shivers.
14sounds horrible
6man, I can't even show you an image of the slide
its fun-orrible
hm?
why?
6see, the park closed down in 2004, and it seems that NO ONE bothered to take pictures before then and put it online >_>
oh
>>
did they close down due to any deaths or injuries on that slide?
thats lame
/me hies
*hides
6that park was the best waterpark E-V-E-R
drf: NRH2O, had several dehydrations
and it hasnt been closed
XD Brother
http://epicwinftw.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/aow3.jpg?w=500&h=375
XD
what is this a parody of 1984?
yes
Ironic that work was the only good one of orwell and it was by complete accident :p
12Brother
12all a toolbox needs is WD-40 and Duct tape
but thats the boring way
12if it moves, not supposed to move use duct tape. if it doesn't move, supposed to move, use WD-40
12XD
Aurora: what was its name?
http://epicwinftw.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/129144915979867853.jpg

true
but eyes used to be the only thing I really had trouble with
lol how time works XD
and eyes tend the be the hardest part for most people =/
03oh, this is just great
03School of Rock is airing on TBS HD (I want an HD recording)
03TBS is the ONLY station that doesn't work :(
03For me
03it comes in silent LOL
03I get picture but no sound
03which is kinda... useless for recording stuff
lol yeah
and why doesn't TBS work for you?
/me loves that channel ^^
03Dunno
03I had the cable company over here TWICE
03They're like "It's not our fault"
03I'm like, I can PROVE that it's your fault
03and they guy saw the picture I made
03and was like
03that's not our fault
03>_>
meh
cable companys
03well
03I REALLY hate Turner networks' HD channels at times
03as they fricking stretch everything :@
03like they call shows like Family Guy HD
03when they aren't
03>_>
03same with Home Improvement, TBS *RUINED* That
I hate how they stretch programs and think people aren't going to notice
which is the sad truth a lot of the time
03Yeah -_-
03my friend was like
03"You mean Family Guy ISN'T widescreen?"
03I was like um, yes?
I have Dish, they're an okay company
03EW SATELLITE
03I made a picture this morning
03because I was bored
EW DRF
I have antenna >:V
03XD
03yeah, over the air is cool
03anyway
03http://images.cheezburger.com/completestore/2010/6/29/0cf49c5d-5289-4f60-b2b6-574007c7b8c4.png
We had cable
03well I hvae reasons for hating satellite companies
it sucked
:V
03I mean
03cable is kinda evil too
03BUT
03There's benefits
03the number one thing for me is analog cable
03we have like 4 TVs
03we only pay for digital cable on one
03:)
03if you have satellite, good luck with that LOL
03plus I can record HD stuff on my computer
XD yeah
03you also can't do that with satllite
03so yeah
03I have my reasons
I didn't ask for it
i hate it too
03the number one reason I hate it is having to pay for a receiver box for EVERY TV
03with cable you only need one if you want HD
i know -.-
03and since we only have one HDTV
03we only hv eone box
recording via computer on sattelite is doable
:V
03how?
03in HD?
yes :V
03I just put a cablecard in my computer
03Satellite doesn't use cablecards
03:P
03you'd have to pay for a receiver
03then use some obscure method
03to do it
"splitter", for one
they make those :0
03...
03the problem with that
03you can only watch one chanenl
03*channel
03my grandparents do that LOL
03they have Dish, and like 3 TVs
03and they can only watch one station
I don't mean split to two TVs
03on any given TV
03then what?
Split one to a recording system thing :V
03...
you're watching the program anyway
03oh
03not really
03Often times I record one thing as I'm watching something else at the same time
03:P
I'd use it to just record while I'm not watching :V
03well regardless
but, I have virtually nothing here :V
03you still need to record it through the analog hjole or whatever
03-j
03you can't rip stuff directly off the dish
03I can do it with cable :P
we don't have sattelite anymore, anyway
03we never had it, XD
my parents were thinking of getting a TiVo, which I was trying to get them to not do because I was saying I could just build a system that does basically the same thing
:V
03we've had cable my whole life
03literally, when my parents bought the house back in 1987, the previous owners had Comcrap
03and were like here, just pay for it if you want it
03so they did
we had cable when I was young, and it went out every time there was a drizzle
03XD
lol I remember cable at my dads old house
03and back in around 2002 we switched to WideOpenWest
03and never went back
03WOW is quite an awesome cable company :)
And they don't service my area
:V

well, those 5 sick days count as 2 absences
04your little...
04problem
which makes 5 when put together with the excused ones
04well problems
just a word of advice to you guys... when you get sick and you call in you have 3 days to where it will count only one against you whether you use those 3 days or not
03I slept on a bed by closing my eyes. :3
/me runs

03It killed them mostly
04good
and those excused abences were told by management as part of my vacation and abreivement
here's an idea, quit working at freaking WAL MART and go somewhere else for a job
Well, I just kind of meant how are you in general, but whatever. :P
/me humps Sneas!
It's not a bad job
14Did someone say "shadowwww"?
and it's hard to find work anywhere
i just dont like the management there

/me trips Kyu

i was thinking the sinister villin look but ok

Did you tell them Infamous and I said hi?

Black Cat is awesome, they gave us 3 extra fountains 48 jumping jacks, and these things called cracker balls for free as well as lighting sticks
04which one?
People think it should be public and I do too XD
04you've probably made over 100 topics
one in the topic here
type /topic
or /topic #True-Flame
Black Cat makes some awesome stuff :D
04the reason i made it private
mmhmm
04was so that it'd be more well you know
yeah I know what you mean
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvmIzxO0-n4
But sometimes it's better to get other people you don't know
04a controlled group, it actually becomes the community PO server because its just the community
14hi
04heh
04give me a server name and description
04and i'll do it later
/me wants to play that video on the phone next time a telemarketer calls

Orly drf
PROVE it ;3
find a real vampire
03ever seen Dracula? :P
and show me >:3
well we could send LL to Romania :P
that is as fictional as Twilight
@drf
03but less gay.
/me hides
03seriously, sparkling men?
XDD
03that screams homosexual to me
Hm
drf: actually think about it
You know what I never noticed before
14?
Chikorita has the same gender ratio as Bulbasaur
a woman who has NEVEr heard of any good vampire books/movies
14lol
I wonder if it's the same with all the starters? XD
decides to make a book where vampires sparkly
its obviously the work of a 'extreme' fan girl :P
Dracula is, depening on the film, on the "awesomeness" scale, somewhere between: "Woah!" and "Holy <bleep>!" :P
/me is probably just stupid and this is common knowledge xD
if Edward, Jaspar and Emmett are homo, why are their mates FEMALE?
@drf
because they need to be hidden :P
...
that makes no sense
that and I dont think sparkling men= gay
LL: erm..ever heard of a closet something
then why mate with women?
03and are just using girls as a cover?
/me runs
03that's actually common
they're bi?
lol
/me hides
that is possible Brother
drf: it is but how can sparkling men be considered gay? XD
but that wasnt a choice
thats more like if LL was thinking of link in..green armor?
o.o
work of ab obessed person

the only armor Link wears is magic o3o\

He would have told me at least one of the following phrases
OMG UR JUST JELUS OF EDWURD
1. "you're just jealous"
Blech
2. "you're too stupid to understand it"
ECCO
3. "get a life"

XD
12drf
12they take money away from McDonalds
12they aren't all that bad
I have no idea why is there so much hype about Twilight... I've never even read the books or seen any of the films... or had any involvement in the series whatsoever... Nor do I plan on doing so any time soon.
04LoL updates lol
because people LIKE it
12the people who like it though
12are rather... aggresive about it
03well

/me huggles back and is protected :o
/me stops crying
/me churrs and holds in his strong wings and glares at Phoenix

/me uses a hydropump, protecting the latias still
"No catching Legendaries"
lolwut

/me hides

/me then smiles "I care about only a few"
/me believes in Mew over Arce lol
03Same :3
XD
/me nods :3
^-^
I fell in love with Latias on Sapphire, even more seeing Pokemon Heroes
2I went into a massive Lati phase after seeing that
I just liked Latias
Latios to me was icing on the cake
hiya Feather~
:D
it was all about Latias and Lugia <3
2And it's been revived now that I've been looking at Vypor's work on dA AND that I got Latias
10hiya LL~ :D
2I have to watch PH again ._.
o3o
/me huggles
I be sneaky XP
2Latis are WAY too awesome
/me eeps and blushes slightly

03This sucks
04lol
03LOL WTF @ THIS Family Guy
/me sits down
03they were playing Paintball with real guns
03and start shooting each other
03When I try to play the older games I get bored. D:
2I wanted to use the Wi-Fi connection but they couldn't fnd the WEP key
2and they only had a USB =.=
/me wanted to play Red again but *bored* :(
asdf I hate three connection limit
2idk where my GB is
I usually run Me, and two bots.
;o;
And they aren't pinging ;o;
03Believe it or not
2'^'
03My first GameBoy still works
03As in the big fat one

2I can't find either of mine
03Takes 4 AA batteries though D:
but mine is a GB Pocket
03XD
2One used to be Mum's, and the other was given to me by a close friend
03I still has my GB, GBC, and original GBA
2Purple and Pokemon :3
2Both of mine are GBC
/me has...
03yay Manaphy vs Firebreathers
2I need a new battery for my DS lite
03Wtf Firebreathers with Koffings

03I has a PSP too but that's not Nintendo :3
Hello anyone preparing to say hello to me. :)

Hm
2and I bought Gold and Silver version off him
SNES, 2 N64, GC, WII, 2 PS2, 360
03I want a 360 someday
2'cause he wanted to get rid of them and he also had Crystal, which he kept
03Not a PS3
03I've seen how bad those are because my friend's brother has one
2I have 2x GBC, 1x DS lite, and 1x Wii
the ONLY reasons I would get a PS3 are Katamari and KH
2._.
03XD
03oh
2Mum stopped using the Wii for some reason
03Are Black/ White for the DS or 3DS?
Well, I'm tempted to leave this place for good since the discontinuation of the forums and the traffic drop from the format switch. It's like a sinking ship now. Unfortunately, the only way off is to jump early or go down with it and face all the time you wasted here.
2so approval fail on my part
hai Guesst and Yoshi~

2DSi I think

no @TV = no HD
03if you want them in HD
03THAT'S why
Oh

14,15 Welcome to the Federation Starship SS Buttcrack.
/me waves to Presea
hi
how are you?
half awake
long time no chat ^^
just woke up
ya
nice
hey guys
hi
Lyon's here?
I'm a lion if that helps
mmk
i believe so Shiny
I got somethin to show him and he's not even here? >:/
it shows he's here, but he's probably AFK
Makes sense for what time it is, but I would expect a name change then
agreed
Nickelback FTW!
agreed?
i agreed with you that there should have been a name change
just do /whois
Not what I meant
?
Lyon's just one who changes his name when he goes off to do something, so I just expect him to do it when he's gone
Lyon has been idle 16hrs 31mins, heh more then afk
Lol well like I said, it makes sense for what time it is
Meh, it's just a picture
http://nonstopkarate.wordpress.com/2010/06/28/remembering-the-day-team-rocket-won/
...lol
Maybe now they'll let us be the villains in a Pokemon game |D
wut
lol
Also, after 4 seasons of battling, Ash still doesn't know that electric moves have no effect on ground types
XD
what a n00b
I don't know why, but I saw Pokemon on and I decided to watch it
It was almost over, but I decided to watch the remainder of it
Ash, his friends, and their Pokemon had somehow been shrunk, so they were trying to find a way to return to normal
Well they cross paths with a wild Camerupt and it starts to charge at them
Ash decided to make Pikachu use thunderbolt on it
then raindance happens and stops the Camerupt from charging?
no
Ash was surprised that thunderbolt didn't work
._.
meow
:c
well i suppose if you recall ash's battle with brock, thunderbolt took down an onix
maybe he simply never learned
/me hides
Covered in water
;P
;p
but still
Again, after 4 seasons of battling, he still has no idea XD
I KNOW LOL
I mean
he uses Thunderbolt on EVERYTHING.
Even a swirling vortex of water *coughlatestmoviecough*
haven't seen it
well, Presea, it did not beat Onyx directly
then again i haven't seen any of the newer movies
There's a part where a hole appears in the sky
the showers did
it beat a rydon directly
See, in the older seasons/episodes, he had a stupidity but most people let it off because he was either knew to the battle system
And it sucks up a bunch of water
via it's horn
and piplup
Or the stupidity was funny (Aka: Him meaning stalker, but saying streaker)
Ash: PIKACHU USE THUNDERBOLT
Me: WTF?!
Ash also never gets past round 3 in the pokemon league lol
Yet he takes down Legends.
I find that hard to believe XD
He actually WON one of them?
same
Shiny yes
Wait, that couldn't have been the original script
He always wins rounds one and two
Past that
OSH I LOST HOW WHY BAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWW
Because
YOU SUCK
Every frikkin time
And I stole your wallet
John McCain's ad compaigns are just... awful
Hence why I don't watch Pokemon anymore
>>
well he's never "beaten" a legend he mostly runs, dies, or triggers a plot event
most are
Presea hi
hi
Yes, I'm the reason why Ash changes his Pokemon practically every season, because he doesn't have enough money to take them over to the next region
They seem so unprofessional though
XD
Yeah that's retarded
You remember the ads against Obama, right?
infact when i saw the episodes of pokemon featuring not ash, but the ppl from gold/silver/crystal i honestly wished it'd keep going as i was tired of ash
I'm gonna start out with new Pokemon so that I can actually lose at the first gym herpderp
:x
They did more damage to himself than to Obama...
Oh yes
lol Pokemon Chronicles
Haha Shiney
YES
Chronicles was decent
ya
Compared to the show it was amazing
/me runs
Take for example Alabama's govenor campaign
he tries to get the driver registration for only english
ya
Compared to the manga it was nothing
Because you can actually kill Pokemon in the manga
|D
also, i haven't watched the show in quite awhile, but i have a feeling team rocket is still in the show in every episode
But this will hurt him more because even though Alabama is one of the states that makes Confederates its govenors and governing body to openly accept racism is what its populance wont accept
They are
I loved the manga
they need a new job
Red ftw
never found a decent copy of the manga
they even made fun of it on Tosh.o
You can find it on OneManga.com
Or at least, that's how I read it
Now he's doing the same to his opponent in the running for Arizonan govenor and the ad is all over the place. It looks like it was cut and edited by a middle schooler because it litterally comprises of other commercials being cut and pasted together. XP
hey Presea : I love the ones with Red, Blue and Yellow
didn't see it on mangafox didn't try mangaone
Arizona has killed itself in any political ground
onemanga :U
with that law the conservatives really have killed themselves
onemanga w/e

I think it's gonna be overturned
though the liberals do nothing much
does it show the pokedex talking to ash? ;p
It probably will
the FRSO has been fighting it, has as the USUP
i loved how it made fun of him in the first few episodes
i wonder why it stopped
Utah revoked
Minnasota, revoked
O.o
Because Dexter became upgraded
And wasn't as cool
There's dozens of other organizations threatening to pull funding and cancel vacations here
the laws support is going down thankfully
they took out the AI, as it'd probably turn into skynet
/me hides
its a game with only 2 main players
(late) i dun never heard of Chronicals
with all the lapdogs each could have
hanity, oriely, Glenn Beck, etc
Then you FAIL

i dont have cable or YT access, so thats why
I really wonder what's going to happen next
maybe, it'll be "Our" moment
or maybe just something we could use
ah, well you missed out on a good series
so umm...
does anyone want to see my drawing?

kk, uploading soon
it really proves both canidates for presidency were not suitable, such as the rest of our presidents
lol Tracey Sketchit.... name fail
2XD
Hmm, wonder what he does for a living
2I think it'd be obvious lol
Yeah I know, it's sarcasm
XD
ogod.. tracey
he was just filler
nothing more
I still remember his Marill of doom
exactly @ Pre
and his Scyther
i liked his old scyther
yeah
that's about it
it had a back story
He wasn't even a filler
He was like...a filler character's long lost child
he was there to be stupid and fail
Who pretended to be like Prof. Oak when he was 10
XD
he was in one of the movies, sitting in the backround doing nothing if i remember right
Pokemon 2000
ya that's it
And in Pokemon 4ever's credits
At the VERY END of the credits
lol
trying to get in the movie it seems
lol the quote i remember most out of 2000..."more like the frozen one" and "I need pants"

So, you've been evil? Good?
Online?
I've been just, but vengeful.
Whenever a posse is ganging up on a player, I ride in and wipe them out.
Whenever someone tries to take me out for no reason, I kill them repeatedly till they surrender or literally beg me to stop.
This past weekend, it was me and my friend against the world...
12o-o
A posse of 4 people attacked us on a plain
who betted the world would win?
We, of course, killed them multiple times
I bet on the world to win the world cup over mars
12what are we talking about?
But soon other two-man posses joined the fray till it got to the point that it was literally us two versus 12 other people and the battle stretched out across a fort, over the plains, and to the cliffs
Kipi
do you have oblivion for the PC?
12oh
12i see
We killed the jerks who tried to shoot us at least 10 times each for every death we had
I got on my horse 'n' charged at them, while shooting 'em up with a pistol so they started complaining that I had better weapons...
There was even a time I flanked this guy who was hiding behind cover and knifed him to death...
The words that followed...
they filled me with happiness. ¦3
12what a confusing game
Warning: carnival rides are dangerous and can result in pants wetting, vomiting, and death.
Okay... what is there to be confused about?

How is that a brighter note? :o
Hi.
hi's!
and its a brighter note because I gets to see Jacob take his shirt off
k.
But would you not have to tolerate the rest of the stuff too?
its a sacrifice
Is it really worth it? :O
yesh, Jacob is omg ripped
it'd be easier to tolerate if the 'vampires' didn't make me mad so much
They should be on fire!
Fire makes everything better!
in the first movie one of the 'vamps' catch on fire
:o
but all the vamps sparkle.. and that pisses me off
haha
It would be lulz if there was a standard non-sparkling vampire in the series killing the sparklers out of mercy.
i so agree
and hi's Proto

Hilariously... I just realized a torrent I'm downloading isn't pirated it's actually supposed to be torrented... The CBC has offically become epic in my opinion.
This is the most important lesson you will ever learn
If you're wearing the red uniform and you're on the team going to investigate the planet
You will not come back
just finished eating
:P
thanks
did you get a gmail message from SR last night
You're welcome
I don't think so
why?
coz at like 12 in the morning I randomly got a gmail chat message from him for some facebook thing, worded like an add
Was it likemypost.com?
yes.
He's been talking about that in other channels for the past frew days
still weird how he sent that o_O
hey
Hello
Hey
But yeah anyway, SR blocked me and I removed him from my contacts, so
Maybe he sent it out automatically to all his contacts or something
What happened?
yeah coz I asked "what" and he said "I made a new site :)"
then I just ignored him and went to bed
From SR
Hmm
An interesting turn of events
it's that likemypost thing he's been talking about in #staff for the past few days
ah
I guessed as much
What I don't get though is if it's a new site, how does it already have over 4000 facebook fans?
O.o
I mean, it's not like there aren't already 39872359 other facebook-like sites out there
his add said "likemypost.com v2 is now live!"
so I assume it's a new "version"
Maybe he helped with the new version
oh maybe
bbl
I got an interview
:D
I removed him on Skype too
Oh, nice
:P
When's the interview?
tomorrow at 8:30
:D
^_^
it's that fabric store, right?
Yep
second shift Mon-Fri
:D
Lol, I just thought of something
brb, jenna wants me to watch a video
k
o.o
removed who from Skkype?
SR
lol
Brb, dinner/breakfast is ready
/me feels so weird eating pancakes and sausage at 6 pm XD

:D
Why?

I may start working in a fabric store...
:P
haha
Is that what you were going to say earlier?
yep
epic: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EC2tmFVNNE&feature=topvideos
:O
I was waiting for this trailer
now let's see how long it and Jenna's video take to load
maybe not as epic as that Mass Effect 2 trailer though eh? :P
I dunno
Harry Potter has the potential to be quite epic
But at the same time
that ME2 trailer was /really/ epic
loll
so it may be a tough contest
well
We'll find out
If you start having urges to watch it 15 more times
dun... dun... DUNNN!!!
XD
*12
oh no *13
*over 9000
I watched it a total of 14 times
nuh-uh
that would be quite sad
hm
I'm trying to think of more places to delete SR from
Hmm
Neoseeker?
I got Facebook, gmail, skype, neoseeker
Xbawb Live?
lol
*Xbawx
Xbob
i has no xbob
Oh
is there a pal pad thing in Mario Kart?
Oh yeah
Could delete him from there
I think he's still on tehre
XD
Oh yeah, I also got youtube
back
wb
Oh yeah, can't forget Youtube
that one is crucial
:P
?
dA?
places to delete SR from
yeah, just as crucial as Mario Kart
:P
yep
what did he do now
I don't think I ever added him on my old dA
lol, I just looked through my Pal Pad on Pokemanz
all my friends are from here
except 1
but my other old account with the stupid name I did
And he didn't do anything
I just felt like deleting him because he sucks

her sister isn't though
Nor my brother
but yeah about that trailer...
Doesn't stop him from watching Family Guy at night though
Am I the only one with goosebumps?
Lol
no
did they block toon disney as well
lol
Haha
I don't think we even get that channel
Howabout Animal Planet?
:P
But the reason they blocked it was because of Adult Swim at night
ah
some of the crap i can see being block for being offensive...
I don't care enough to ask them to unblock it'
never seen that
The only show on Cartoon Network I watch is Pokemon
xP
and I rarely ever watch it
2 minutes at any sequence of that show is offensive to me
My dad banned me from watching Pokemon when I was 10 or 11
lol?
wtf
:(
and weren't they gonna stop you from playing spyro or something too because of the "violence"
You lived a deprived childhood
Then about 5 years later I was watching it again
even though you wouldn't ride on a [censored]ing dragon and slay the town
dear lord does he go through your purse every time you go in and out of the door and make you walk through a metal detector?
O.o
That would be creepy
AGES 4-11 = BELIEVING IN FANTASY TALES AND FOLLOWING YOUR DREAMS WHY DID YOUR PARENTS NOT SEE THIS
i dont even know anyone that is remotely that strict
Dad: "What are you watchcing?" Me: "Pokemon" Dad: "Didn't I tell you you couldn't watch that?" Me: "That was when I was 10." Dad: *silence*
ha
:P
heh
apparenly when I was 3 I saw clouded leopards humping
I argued with my mom about something like that today
gosh
I don't think I was ever banned from Spyro for it being too violent though
huh?
If anything the Playstation in general for playing it too much
hah
I was banned from my ganecube a few times for that reason
i was sorta lucky.... i played my stuff until i got tired of it
more like grounded I guess
well what else is there to do in these times other than sit around and play videogames/watch tv and being banned from doing anything else
play outside
apparently
lol, forgot about that
What;s there to do out there though?
:P
That was my parents' answer for everything
half the time when i was a kid id hurt someone by playing outside
"GO PLAY OUTSIDE"
:P
haha
QuantomAlpha: XD
there were never any kids on my street when I was a little younger thus why I never played outside because I couldn't go anywhere without having to walk a distance
You were a bully then I take it?
but mommy theres a weird guy outside... go outside and play! but mommie.... NOW!
same here
nope
I only had one friend within walking distance
i just had a nack for playing too rough
all the rest were from 30-45 minute drives away
hell i was bullied when i was 10/11
and when your that little you can't go walking around the neighborhood by yourself
i use to go at the back of my block and meet up with kids that played pokemon and collected pokemon cards
I'm so jealous
until one of them got the cops called on them for throwing rocks at another and then we broke up
I wish I had a group of kids that did that
when I was a little younger I was madly in love with pokemon and hamtaro
it was just me and a couple friends that had Pokemon cards
it wasnt all that speical
lol hamtaro
"got the cops called on them for throwing rocks at another" Okay, maybe I'm not so jealous after all
:P
lol
i kneed one of them in the crotch for some reason as well but that was rough housing
lol
strange nickname
I loved Hamtaro
ham ham
Too bad it got canceled :(
hamtaro is the [censored]ing [censored] I've been replaying my one game
hamtaro reminds me of card captors and sailor moon for some reason
lol, sailor moon
I remember that one
yeah
i dont think ive ever sat through an entire episode as a kid
you should all watch this you'll laugh your ass es off http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-Ix5wqipQs
lol, censored cat evasion
i think it was before or after thundercats though
I never watched Sailor Moon
I just watched that trailer again
Not one episode

"About Me: I'm very disappointed in you; and you know why. You shouldn't have done it, but ya did. You listened to me. You knew it was a bad idea. I TOLD you it was a bad idea. But no. You had to. Now, you're somewhere in North Korea and a bean farmer is using your kidney and spleen to barter for a pig. But hey, I told you, even if it only means you disappointed me even more and made me lose just a little more of my faith in humanit

So like 2005/2006
I've been using the internets since... I was 10 I think
no wait
before that

I like the look of this

i love my friends
12i thought you mentioned tst bot is hosted by something
NN wont work with XP :(
Is Things up?
why are there separate lines for Firefox and Mozilla on that chart?
/me poke
Mozilla has ~3 browsers
SeaMonkey FF and...
Seamonkey?
lol
Yup
It was discontinued I beleive
OH, and Mozilla Sueite
Hmm
Suite*
http://www.mozilla.org/projects/browsers.html
Looks like it's still listed
03Um
03sortra
03*sorta
03it's hosted on OVH
12OVH?
03it's just a bot I have access to
03OVH.
03The place I was telling Articuno to host TST on
03it's a webhost
03a channel I work for has a server there
03and I have an account
03so I just use IRC from it
03XD
12how can you host an IRC bot
12on a webhost
I'm gonna watch a movie with my sister
be back in a bit
k
no!
03it's a *server*
03it runs Linux
Hmm called it :)
:O
03you can use IRC on Linux
03:P
12usually when people say webhost
don't worry
12i figure they mean it hosts websites
I will return
you'd better!
I will!
:P
I hate people that are arrogant and act like because you made a mistake you're an idiot. And if people take advice about chemicals like /lye/ from the internet, they're morons.
If they're messing with lye, they know what they're doing
</angry rant>
They've logged into my email account before
ha
SR once sent me a message when my mom was on my account
/me gasp
03it does
/me runs
ha she think he was some 40 year old stalker?
03here's the difference
So for conversations after that where I didn't answer right away he'd be like, "hello?? Mrs. Wagner?"
03cheap webhosts run Linux, but they only give youa ccess to FTP
03this runs Linux and we can actually use it like a computer
03we can still host websites
03but also run programs
03etc
Yeah actaully
that's the reason she was on my email
to read his messages
Chrome uses Mozilla NSS and NPAPI Libraries
at least she didn't pretend to be me though, haha
12i see
i did that on my brother's computer though
o.o
why?
12so if you want to host a program that can't run on linux
course i couldnt pull my brother's personality off
Chrome according to this is a Mozilla project
snooping after i got my pics off of his computer
They look nice, maybe too big
lol
did he find out?
Yeah
I usually carry my phone in my pocket
essentially the computer was my dad's but my brother started using it non stop and it became his
with keys and pens and pointy stuff D:
i dont know if he did or not
but i found a pic of him and annother girl on there
hm
and i'm like ho ho ho..... tres bien!
I just about broke this Rumor 2 already
heh
?
Ran it over with a Snowmobile then it froze shut and a few months later ran it over with a lawnmower
and i'm dead serious on that point
03then you're out of luck.
03The bot uses irssi
03which is a command line IRC client
It fell out of my pocket on the Snowmobile
12lol
03which is why it takes me so fricking long to fix it if YOU GUYS kill the thing
03>_>
03as I have to manually reconnect, it's not auto
no, just the hoody i always see you in
I've never even seen snow
brb i'm gona find that pic
let alone ridden a snowmobile
12i bet bill gates can find a way to make it auto connect :P
03LOL
03inb4 use Windows
12he'll just hire people to find the answer for him
/me runs
12i'm sure he knows how to use linux
What Flordia or something
12afterall where is he going to steal his ideas from
03LOL
yes
meh... the girl has chubbyer cheeks and an emo hoody
LOL
i wonder what hed say if i showed this to him
Its the only off road type thing I have...other than maybe my truck
ohai drf
I'm not gonna mess with that too hard
lol
I don't even have a learners permit
or a bicycle
i need to talk my brother in getting a bur cut before school for the shock factor at school

your parents are nazis!
I know right?!!!
And I would catch rides a lot
GTA:SA is hilariously fun.
/me returns from playing around with various ancient retrocomputing things
mhm, but the only GTA with an actual story is GTA IV
and sadly everyone else in the GTA dies :p
That is true... but, who cares about the story in a GTA game? :P
gamers who care :p
Yesss Ghost Hunters in the hotel from The Shining
haha

Alright, raise of hands, who plays GTA just for the blowing up of stuff? :P

Metrics is so simple and efficient and great
but do we use it? Nooooooo
I don't play that game
gtg dinner
it would cost a lot to switch
they'd have to change the signs on the road for one thing
It should have been metric from the start
I use metric anyways
and people would just complain more that we're spending too much
Well yeah
But too late for that now :P

04Hi all
Hey.
2hi RN
2^-^
/me pounce snuggles
the server's already moved in fact. But the url is still pointing to the wrong server
...wtf
the new server will be at 88.84.143.164
yet the url points at 95.215.225.1 atm
gives me one of those "You ahven't made your site yet" things
because you're not coming with the right url referer
there're four urls runninig on this IP atm - the only thing splitting them is the url
it's quite intended to deliver a different page to the people just asking for an IP
as those are usually the poorest of the poor hackers :P
that's the basic domain security ;)
O...K
usually that means you don't have an index.html o.o

12you know I never got what the phrase "
2when there's an an in front of it, I think "erb"
12oops
12derp ment*
2but then usually it's "herb"
I never hear people say it 'erb, so I'm not used to it. XD
2XD until fifth grade I said "herb," then everyone kept correcting me, so I kept saying "erb" for a few years
/me yawns
D:
/me called him
2except I started saying "herb" again last year 'cause it made more sense XP
2like... "mayonnaise"
2everyone says "may-naze"
2so I sit there thinking "whut?"
O_o
2XD they like, remove the o
2and I 2say2 the o, but really fast so they sound the same to me, but everyone keeps telling me there's no oh sound
2which confuses me
2there ARE 3 syllables in that word, right?
2*checks dictionary* yeah 3
2almost typo'd that as "yeah o3o"
2XD
The second one is hard to tell when you say it quickly.
12every word that sounds weard, they are part of the english language. Take the word "pnamonia" for example (I think that's how you spell it :P)
12...
2XD
12what?
I think my pet hate with pronunciation has to be "aitch", as "haitch".
2lol
2h?
12???
Yep.
2XD
2somehow I think that "haitch" would be harder to say
What really gets at me is when the ENGLISH teachers pronounce it incorrectly.
12lol
12everyone makes mistakes
2OOOO:
12...
2yeah lol

Hello :o
lol, I told you about our dumb system to paypawn for glass and plastic bottles and drink tins, right?
I just got dinner - with a tin of cola with the menu. To bypass this pawn laws in germany, they imported the tin from poland to sell it here :P
07?
if you go and buy a Red Bull, you pay the price for the drink, right?
07ya
EW RED BULL
or Coke, water - whatever
k
well, here you don't just pay for the drink, but you also need to pay a pawn for the bottle/tin
07oh
07that
07we've had that for years lol
15 cents for a glass bottle and 25 cents for a plastic bottle or a tin
even if those bottles or tins are disposed afterwards?
07you get your money back when you recycle it
yeah
yeah, we've had that forever
Michigan is the highest in the country inf act
at 10 cents
everywhere else it's 5
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wK2fhg0Qil0
that's how the machines look like here
and the prices vary depending on what you have
07o3o
07we don't have those here lol
glass beer bottles: between 8 to 15 cents. Plastic bottles 25 cents if they're disposable, 15 cents if they're re-usable

12Although
12It bit Xai's mouth D:
12Quite badly
who's the other guy?
12He's still got the mark
12Um, read up...
hey, it defended itself. Just was afraid of being hunted by the fox :)
no, the other HUMAN LOL
12Yes?
besides Xai
12Read up....
oh.
that's Lugia? :O
12DUH
12XD
wow
he looks different
than before
mainly the facial hair XD
12I dont remember what photos you saw of him before but ok Lol
12Ahh
12Yeh that makes him look different
grr stupid software
this thing is called SysAid
no f'ing idea what I'm doing
12As usual then?
/me runs
12:D
LOL
brb
XD
still
12brbrb
I'm kinda glad we have so few problems with the maintenance right now
2hullo
as yes, I'm in command right now since 4pm and will be at service for another around 4 hours I guess
12:/
hm
no wonder
we had only two problems til now
remote desktop'ing to my own computer doesn't work
XD
but I can't get it to work on any OTHER oen either...
*one
they're all LAN
one machine didn't like a kernel patch and had to be reverted to another state...and the network crew messed up the database connection for a major server rack
the biggest pile of maintenance will be done tomorrow: We're updating the SAN systems on one of our datacenters. We hope nothing goes wrong there....
hi
02heya, I woke up late XD
LOL
I wish I could sleep in :(
Stupid being at work at 8AM
02heya Arti! :D
and I can't even sneak out of work early today
12I wish I got IRC at work! XD
as I have no car here ATM LOL
we're getting it repaired
I got a ride here :/
though the guys told us we were about 99.99% safe, the last remaining 0.01% would be....well....a catastrophe
12ovo
LOL Arti
it's really weird too
the filters here block sites like verydemotivational.com too
but not Facebook or IRC
02I gotta wake up at 7am tomorrow, me and Danny are leaving for PA at 9 :o
12XD
PA?
if something goes wrong, we lose one of the SAN systems. Each of them around 28 terabytes of data
02yes, Pennsylvania :3
a full restore would take us...well....around a week
Nope.
:O
12Wow thats a lot of data >v<
PA isn't too far from me
02really? :o
Arti, the filter here isn't NEARLY as insane as school
Yeah
well it's like 5-6 hours
but still
XD
closer than NY
02we're gonna be in Nazareth :o
02LOL
>_>
closer than NY <-
/me sings in his head
remember Arti: 28 TB * 5 SAN systems * 4 datacenters. Now you get an idea HOW much data^^
o/` that's just the way it is, some things will never change o/1
02OMFG
I've literally been looping this for 2-3 days
02I never thought that spicy brown mustard would taste soo good on a ham sammich :o
12I always put mustard on a ham sandwich XD
EW MUSTARD
what's awesome is BMTs.
ham, pepperoni, salami, and cheese
and I eat them plain, no veggies XD
12I used to hate mustard until Xai made me try a bit recently
eh
it's not as bad as mayo but I still don't care for it
12Ew mayo
plus
it's empty calories
why not just eat it plain?
02my mom had me try it since there was no mayo D:<
EW MAYO
just eat it plain o.o
02ARGH D:<
what
12mmm butter
02it's too dry that way D:
eh
02BUTTER :o
cheeses?
*cheese
12Im gonna go set this webcam up for Sunday :3
02lactose entolerant D:
:O
webcam?
12The webcam you gave me DRF :3
........
really?
that sucks
and wait
12Yeh there's gonna be a live cam of the BBQ LOL
I gave you a webcam? XD
12WTF LOL
12The logitech one!
God, I give stuff to so many people I don't even remember
:/
12for voice chat
02jealousy D:
ohh
12The blue one
that was a few years ago, right?
LOL BL
12No only last year LOL
I gave you a Nintendo adapter :P
and hm
I actually forgot
sorry
XD
GOD DANG IT
12Nevermind ^^
12I am going to have a live cam of the meet forpeople to watch
XD
cool
12and Im gonna set it up now
12So seeya in a bit
02my mom still won't let me install the adaptor until the disc gets scanned
and if I see you and Xai sneak into a dark closet, I won't question it
I mean
2bbl o3o
hi
2that makes them sound like robbers o-o
BL, heh, I also included the official Nintendo one
:/
grow up, that's not what I was hinting at :P
2uh...
2?
2anyway, bbl o3o
02which I now a plan to do when I leave, since Danny will hopefully bring his laptop :o
XD
I wonder if his laptop is as awesome as mine
/me runs
since he's a nerd and whatnot
02he has his crappier one here with him in NY
XD
02he has 2 laptops :o
my laptop was like $2000
but it's awesome
better than most desktops
and it was all graduation money anyway :)
and LOL, cool
I have two desktops really
the old one and the new one I just built
but the old one's just sitting in my basement
02I wish I had a laptop
yeah
I wanted one all through high school
and finally bought one after I graduated XD
02I wanted to do computer tech for college, but since mom doesn't approve of that, I chose nursing
that's ... a big difference
02I know, and it scares me
XD
my parents were totally supportive of me doing engineering
or w/e
I don't even know yet
I'm just in "engineering"
I'm supposed to pick a specific field but :/
02I absolutely hate needles >_<
oh
I actually don't mind them
except the other day
they had to draw blood and fricking stabbed me in the hand
it still hurts a little
brb
BL, aren't you an adult now? My must your mom choose your career path for you?
*Why
02better money, and yes i'll be 19 in 5 days
Well, is money everything to you?
no offense
02but the choice of nursing also follows something i've been wanting to do for a while, and that it taking care of babies :o
02no, not really
because it's gonna be hard to be a nurse if you can't even give people shots because you hate needles
well, Nursing is a lot more than nusring infants
*nursing
back
02I need to conquer my fears eventually
it's more or less taking care of ill paitents
LOL
true
watch Scrubs if you want an idea :P
but if you cannot in time, then what?
that show is awesome
02I like that show XD
yeah
02but I watch Grey's Anatomy more
EW
I hate girly shows ><
OMFG
I might as well be a person who studies spiders for a living then.... since I'm afraid of them
02well, i'm a girl and it makes more sense XD
I'm making a mess of this soda
and I don't have any napkins
I'm a girl and I hate Grey's Anatomy
wow
lol why did I think of napkins as something else? XD
02mehh, we all think differently of it
my co-workers are talking about drinking
I hate when they do that
I suppose so @ BL
XD
I just made my co-workers laugh
they asked me if I drink
and I was like
orly?
"No, I'm one of very few actually CLEAN college students"
and for some reason they started laughing
02one big step in conquering my fear will be on the 10th, when I get my first tattoo :o
=/
heh
and what you getting a tatoo of, BL?
I'm surprised your parents are letting you get one
I kinda think tattoos are stupid anyway
02my dragon Draikior
she's an adult, she can get one is she wants
(if
v.v
10Tattoos lol
stupid keyboard!
02LOL
LOL I never said she couldn't
and yeah, I'm not big on them either
but I'm an adult and my parents still treat me like a kid

Anyways, I did not get the chance to ask before you went to sleep wether nor not you found the stuff I sent you useful :o
maybe we should make a deal, level 5 levels higher than the other person and wait? :o
or maybe 3
I did, thanks ^^
Or just keep ourselves in a range of 3 levels of eachother?
yeah, that's what I mean
Okay :3
12lol
Do you know that there is a chest in the victory park that giefs excellent items for free once per day? :o
Excellent for silly n00blings like us that is :3

12Wait what IS that? A lighter?
a Zippo lighter, yeah
12It's kinda strange shaped but the picture will look amazing on it
strange shaped?
http://www.magazinusa.com/ResV/img/originals/zippo_windproof_lighter.jpg
that's how it looks like when it's open
wtf are you gonna do with a lighter anyway
12wb arti <late>
12It's handy for starting fires
12XD
heh
most people here just use them to light cigarettes -_-
we have like, matches for fires
12I've been laughing SO hard XD
or butane lighters that aren't the little flip open kind
12We've got lighters too, way easier to light things than matches sometimes
did you know lighters were invented before matches were ever thought about?
12and Pea # 921 made me laugh LOL
12621*
fail
also - the dish cleaner was invented prior a washing machine
12LOL
12I guess I came at a bad time
12http://www.formspring.me/Articuno144
12Top question

12I don't know if I believe he's 20 LOL
/me dies.
>_>
Shame I gotta ask my mom for a ride...
Eff awf.
12I didn't make it
my car's at the repair shop
o.O
Food?
12oh
12lol
Yes!
12hello
<.<
/me senses drama
Where? :o
/me stops playing a caveman.
Drama?
Wasn't me this time! D: I haven't been here for... a while.
I just left a comment. Wonder how he'll react :P
D:
hm... maybe my sense of smell is terrible today then
Yeah, you rejoined right at the same day that Curly persuaded me to join this server D:
/me goes to grab some food
12LOL ok *reads*
12I think I know why he's doing this
12XD
Oh.
Or rejoin on my part as well, but I dunno.
12Because he's creepy
I was around IRC longer.
12he said in a comment that he's jealous
I've just been absent the past day.
or so
12about you an Xai
02hey Xai
12and*
12Yes I know XD
how do you think will he react by that comment, eh?^^
12oh
12But he doesn't eveen know me
I have been avoiding you too, seems like a good policy for avoiding conflict. :3
05he is some wierd old guy
12I know
12Infact the only time I ever heard of this guy was when someone showed me that picture
05it's so creepy
Yes.
Probably good, too.
I'll keep it going.
/me sighs
._.
at least he's very patriotic
/me shrugs.
12he's been commenting on your profile on dA arti
-_-
that was ... weird
my mom texted me back and I didn't get the message
.-.
help
I just called her and she was like oh, didn't you get it?
I didn't bash anyone. I asked what the result might be
I'm upside down
/me stabs Verizon
D:
12He can comment all day long, I'm not there XD
I didn't mean to make her go away D:
12lol ya
05Let me spell it out : Wierd old guy from another country is obsessed with my mate and is jelous of me and is pestering my mate with creepy questions
Sorry ._.
/me flips Proto rightside up
12he sounds like a stalker... I think
LOL Arti
05I'm seriously concerned
._.
does DA have the ability to block people?
:D
ty
05yeah
like prevent them from commenting on your stuf?
hm
*stuff
12yes they do drf
take it another way Xai: Jealousy is the highest form of honoring someone
LOL
12Yeh it does, never thought of that because I don't use DA anymore so it's not a huge problem
12ya
I don't use it either XD
12Buuuuut when I saw that he asked me a question on my formspring, I replied XD
thanks to Facebook
12does he have a TST account?
12No thankfully
12okay
yet don't worry about him. Few of those patriotic guys have the guts to seriously cause any harm
true
12When he doesn't even know me
but well, he's not "old"
12and has never spoken to me
LOL
I wonder if he's seen photos of you
05are you seriously defending disturbing older men chasing after young girls on the internet?
/me hides
12He LOOKS old XD we think he's like pretending to be 20
born feb 29 1988
12I agree then lol
12Yeh I don't believe that after seeing his photo
12LOL
05no fn way
05that is a lie
12I'm looking at his photo right now
05no-one that bald is 22
12he's almost bald
my father had lost most of his hair when he was about 19
I have photos right next to me. So well, it IS possible
05he looks like 38
12Even his face looks old
nah - no
12more like 40
12LOLZ
12my dad is 48 and he still has all his hair
12or 46
12I can't remember
look at the forehead. It's perfectly flat. Not a single wrinkle in it
12My mum doesn't have wrinkles and she's over 50 :3
12lol
one of my work mates is 23 but he looks 40
12Considering the guy hates All alcoholic beverages (as his profile says)..
12it depends on who the person is
I just looked at the picture with him smiling. Someone of around 30 has those if he's smiling. I know it because I have those, too
that guy deffo looks 30
12Has what?
and I have quite a good talent in telling the age of people I see^^
12He's certainly not 22 XD
12He made up the age to try and talk to me XD
12ya XD
12LOL
12now that is creepy LOL
people lying about themselves on the internet: non-shocker! XD
12:3
12I don't lie about my age thank goodness LOL
12I'm 17
12Andrew I take it you saw the Xai pic last time right?
this steam sale has came at a good time
anyways. The guy does not know where you live and even if he did I doubt he would be able to find england on a map
by the way i'm really a samurai ninja dude
12XD
which pic?
12The one he drew of Xai
oh ya
12Loooool
not calming you, I'm trying to calm Xai and tell him not to worry
that guy seems creepy anyway
12it just makes me a little mad when people like him do this kind of stuff >.>
ugh at people who just get all sarcastic at people who misunderstood instead of explaining _-_
05well the very fact he is lying about his age makes me even more suspicious.
12ya
D:
12sounds like some kind of stalker
no, that had nothing to do with anyone here
/me came here just because nobody here was involved >.>
as I said: I really believe his age. He doesn't look like a 30 years old guy. Trust me with that
/me tacklehugs a Curly.
/me hugs back
05i mean why can't he just leave her alone - she has never ever even messaged him and he is asking questions like "I'm worried about you, you don't come on DA anymore"
12I kind of agree with that :/
btw. a 30 year old turkey-bird-fan? Oh come on^^
because people are weird?
XD
12lol
12What about a 30 year old giant white fish fan? *runs*
05a 30-year old who picked ho-oh to sound like a pokemon fan? yes.
12everyone is different
maybe the same reason why I worry about some others? Because Arti's art is - regardless what she says - amazing?
/me slaps Arti with a Schwertfisch
/me sits indifferently in the corner
12Lol
12I know someone who's banned on dA that said he was 21 and likes tomas the train or what ever lol
05so you would track someone down who is inactive on da and send them creepy messages like that?
05just because they had done good art?
:)
12sounds creepy when you think about it :/
/me huggles Proto in the corner of indifference
/me hugs
/me is glad that this place serves as a good retreat from drama :3
02D:
I would just ask this person why he/she disappeared (in fact, gender is irrelevant at that point :P ), yeah. It's not a big deal to ask at least
12Thats not the only creepy thing though, the fact that he also drew a pic of Xai getting beaten up by a washing machine and then said he was JEALOUS Ovo
12idk if what he's doing is reportable on dA?
if this person tells me to leave her alone, I go, yeah
12Yeh but "I'm worried about you"
12Why is he worried when he can see I'm active on TST?
05no, you didn't answer my question - you would track them down to a different website and register just so that you could ask them why they went off da?
maybe he didn't join TST?
12I replied to one of his comments on your dA profile arti and said that you weren't active on there anymore...
2(Xai2): No, I'm not SUCH a kind of stalker^^
05thank you.
12He hasn't joined, but he got on, went through the whole site then went to ask me a question on my Ask Articuno page
12but he didn't reply back
12Where he could see that my last answred questions were recent
12I'm actually SURPRISED he's not joined LOL XD
did you know I saw this "ask Articuno"-page for the first time in my life today?^^
12LOL
maybe he tried but I deleted him already?^^
12Lol
12LOL
only from the original picture link you posted some time ago
12Ok, I havent seen him try to draw yet XD
12I'll brb

Was it you?

6possibly tonight
6I might be busy tomorrow
XD, it' be hilarious if you put them in a katyusha
and let them fly
6I've only got two and a half hours until the contest drawings
6crossing my fingers here
XD, to get that truck right?
and make it the superspecialawsome truck?
truck?
what starts with F and ends with uck? Fire truck!
/me runs
!define rtfm
-!- RTFM is an initialism for the direction "Read The <censored> Manual". This instruction is sometimes given in response to a question when the person being asked believes that the question could be easily answered by reading the relevant "manual" or instructions. ...
...
6I really dont care about the truck
I can't fix that from here -_-
^^
6I mean, if I win it, then heck yes lets party
6But still
so then what do you care about winning?
the honor
6the $700 block party firework box
6because I actually have a decent chance at it lol
6indeed <3
XD
!lag
Fireworks would be awsome with a Katyusha, and a interesting change
only because it doesnt just go straigh up
I like those big fireworks, but just don't like those stuff just making *boom*
fireworks reminds me of the chinese characters for firechicken..(AKA the Turkey)
you mean this thing others call Ho-oh?
No
In chinese mandarin the literal translation of the characters are fire
and chicken
6but they make fabulous colors
6Purple Rains <3
besides, july 4th is the day for corporations all over the US to try and sell as much as possible
6 4th of july is a day I hang out with friends, play around during the day, have an awesome barbeque lunch/dinner, and then party with fireworks all night
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP4CEeYgYxU&feature=related
THAT's fireworks :)
6indeed, but those are illegal buys out here
then Aurora will have a good night XD

I liked it
I'm watching it :D
O.o
You woulf
wolf*
why do you love Disney all of a sudden, Brother? O.O;;;;
I dont
I just watch old disney movies to remind myself
some of their work isnt bad
and others just are horrible like hollywood
XD excuses excuses
D:
old Disney is good XD
besides, I dont want to watch a movie that gets to the point right now XD
blah
only parts of it drf
and you like the color red not because it was the Soviet Union's flag :P
Nah
different reasons :P
riiiighhhtt
XD
besidesm why do you say that when I'm listening to the victory song XD
because I can? :P
oh yah before I extrmely forget
Aurora did you see that new Avatar movie?
6not yet
6I almost did though
It looks dumb =/
6I loved the series
why make a real life movie off a cartoon?
/me drops a fireball on everyone!
6the movie probably is gonna absolutely slaughter it
the series was meh
aurora: yeah
it will
6although props to them for making some of the scenes IDENTICAL to the show
I saw it 'kinda'
6that never happens
Well ironic
and same with my loving the Guardians of Ga'hoole series, the movie will ruin what little love it has
they found Aaang (now called Aoong) on the internets
but hopefully it wont fail like Karate Kid did
or Kung Fu kid..whatever it is legitmately
it most likely will =/
/me sighes
LOL, Karate Kid already has a bootleg DVD link
er
:o
-link o.o
6lol
lol
drf: thats only because the kid is the son of a famous guy :P
LOL

but I mean

Well... my first "personal" computer actually was "retro"... yay for a surplused IBM System/32... which was interesting.
bet you don't know any schellack LPs anymore - and if you see such a thing you have no idea why there're speeds like 15, 33, 45 or 72 on it, right?
I don't have shellac LPs, but I do have a small library of vinyl (sounds nicer).
Speed wise, I though the speeds were 16-<fraction>, 33-1/3, 35 and 78.
(I don't remember the speed of the slowest one perfectly, but I do know they were used for radio transcription.)
anyways - I'm in bed now
almost two hours after midnight and I wanna fetch some sleep
hi guys
2hi
the TST meet has been awesome today :)
...
wished I had been there, too
ohai andrew
well, I'll get another chance to meet all of you
2Â°_Â°
Oh hey, I just realized... my System/380 mini-project has finished installing MVS/380. Woot, time for first IPL.
2â

the BBQ and webcam will be on tomorrow, so you can pretend you're there at least XD
this weekend is/was our maintenance window for our datacenter systems. And we had to upgrade our storage system of one datacenter - therefore shutting down all servers running there
oh right
04morning
that's why we have maintenance weekends. One in every month. Some of them are shorter, others longer
wb lyon
04ty
but if we don't perform the maintenance, the systems will just fail
Well... preventative maintenance is always a good idea.
sure, but patches need to be installed. And an installed patch requires a server to be rebooted. Something that can't be done in the productive time
npl
and storage controllers need new firmware so we can extend each rack over 28 terabytes of disk space
backup systems need to be updated to faster and more performant one's
What is the backup media that you use any way?
whats up lyon
we mirror on two other SAN sytems in different locations and have tape robots
04the roof
but a full restore of a datacenter would take around...well....a week
or two
Well... that sounds rather average in time length.
depends on how critical the data is
Tell me, you ever work on real big iron?
(Best I've done is as an unpaid weekend "operator" (i.e. "Just watch the system so if it crashes you can call someone.") guy for an aging ESA/390 based box - it crashed twice.)
/me shoots ari first
Gentlemen, take it to a duel >.>
erm....dunno what you'd call "real big iron", but we have around 32 racks filled with 72 quad-core-processors. And that's just the recent AIX farm we've built up
"Big Iron" being the nickname for a mainframe-class system.
as I said - we have about 32 of those newly in one of the datacenters
/me pokes Espeon
how many had been there already...dunno...all I know is we have around 5000 logical servers running in my region
Nono, I mean something like the S/360, S/370, S/370-XA, ESA/370, ESA/390, z/System; and the clones of those.
Heya pplz~

Yup XD

it's exactly 9 actually
04lol
I get too into games

One logical server on a z/System would be the equivalent of either flaunting your money. Or moronic operators.
2o_oâ¬
2...
04lolwut @Kipis quit
that's why we have between 30 to 50 LPARs running on one of those machines. Depends on what the LPAR is needed for

Lyon: how do guilds work in morrowind anyway?
04uh
04you join them
04you get their services
no; like
04you do quests for rewards
how tedious are they
04that's basically it
04oh
04well
04it depends on the Guild
04but most are rather tedious, but some are pretty fun
Say..that Imperial cultish thing
04?
04oh that is ridiculously easy at the start
Oh
04but I never got to the later quests so I don't know
i thought it was hard if you wanted to join all the guilds XD
which apperently you can in oblivion
and its really suprising how advancements work
04in Morrowind, if you join some guilds and complete them you can't join other guilds
usually 1 or 2 people do it
XD
Bethseda wanted to change that :P
04a Prime example of this is the Fighters Guild
let me guess..
if you join fighters guild
then you can't join thieves guild?
04yup
04well
04if you haven't finished all the quests you still can
because the fighters guild fights :p
Sleeptime.
Good night.
ah
So..what if you're leader you can't be bothered to do such things?
04but once you finish the last two quests you can no longer join the Theives guild
04I can't say why because it'll spoil the quests
XD
well for advancment in oblivion..it gets rather dumb
though theres a mod that mocks it XD
04lol
yeah killing all the guild heads and ranimus polis basically kills the mages guild
they can't do anything for ranimus is literally
04lol
the only guy who will promote you
04heh
while in DB for example
theres 3
i am the invisible man... i am the invisible man...
the vampire
04the head of the Mages guild in Morrowind is an absolute idiot
the argonican
*Argonian
and the cool speaker
04lol
the idiot o the whole entire guild
04I'm guessing being a vampire in Oblivion is cooler than in Morrowind?
It is
though you can use some tricks to get around feeding
04lo
waiting; never do it
04LOL
just fast travel
3Hi
04hi
and the sun
will never
hurt you
:D
just feed
04lol
and never wait, which this triggers probablly the script or action to begin the 'vampiring' process
though you can only be a vampire
which completely is lame
3Wat
Floof has arrived!
for I want to be a lich XD
04SKYLANDS
/me glomps
/me hugs
/me follows Drake and glomps Sky shortly after

04how are you Sky?
04lol
10Fine, you?
04there are Werewolves in the Morrowind Expansion, Bloodmoon
Yeah
04I'm good, a bit tired
but these mods make that look stupid :p
for theres a bit of a twist
10don't have much to keep me un-bored, though
at night you must feed, and the werewolfs look like werewolfs
04:|
i suspect mods copied from mods
04lol
since Legends of the North werewolfs
look exactly like werewolfs and "curse of hircine" mod

DOUBLE BAN
10Was that just epic timing, or..? XD @NS
02I saw that Skylands
02AND LOL
So; what was it in your view?
02XD
it's more like "hi we're going to threaten to kill your people if you don't give up your crown" kind of colonization
SEE?
02hey

speak of that

"oh we just got it"
"...how?"
"we dont answer to your type round here son"
10Powder moths are the worse
13Then take it back outside :U
there's no such thing as a good guy
Texans never speak about what they did here XD
it's just what they're making you want to think
anyways, i gotta leave
later
05i cant find it, it was flying around and it landed somewhere, and @ Sky, thats what it is
bai
13It'll turn up soon
12oh
05it better before i go to sleep, or its gonna bug me all night.....(heheh bug me, pun fully intended)
13If you make lots of noise, you'll scareit and it'll fly somewhere else
05you serious?
02^
Lyon: playing morrowind or Halo?
05lol i know that
almost home
brb
05theres a rule with me to, if its on me, and i dont want it to be or dont know about it, i kill it, if i dont care, pick it up, and let it go
05thats more the rule for spiders, but other bugs like that count
3There is something wrong with the chat... Every time I go to a tab it exits and when I try to sign in, it saidit was in use.....
13I only kill it if its about to harm me :|
05the only reason it got in my house in the first place was because of my air conditioner, for some reason they can get through the fan inside and sneak into my bedroom
13xD
05its not just moths either
05crazy June Bugs, and these little tiny black beetle things, those bettles that jump and make a click noise, all kinds of crap comes through there
13Well, you can try to get it fixed; I'm sure someone could do something about it
3I accedentally read it as Sparkly food
3awaaaay
05lol theres nothing wrong with the air conditioner, its works fine and very fantasmic, but even the fan going at the highest speed still let them through, but sometimes depending on the size, lol, i sometimes hear a small grinding noise D:
3why does everyone hate me?
13Well,you could try to board up where they're coming in
05~.~ wouldnt that defeat the purpose of the air conditioner?
/me 13thinks
3Why?
12o-o
3wut
12nuting
3im leaving
12nuthing
back
connection :P
13As I said; you could get someone professional to look at it, maybe turn up the speed, or you could block the sides of the air conditioner so the bugs don't come near at all.

13hey
:(
12kk
dem cocky boys
:3
12hi
Okay
Hello
03y
I got my iPod working again
ohai
03EW IPODS
It just took a trip to the apple store to get the firmware repaired
And the os correctly installed
And because of the os, I kept having connection problems
/me waves to all the people who just joined :)
weeeeeeeeeeee
They should be nonexistant now
Why thank you madame
LIES! IOS 80 has been patched. DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD:
03APple should be nonexistant now
I beg to differ
03orly
Hmm, brb, need to check IOS 249.
03all their products are inferior to others on the market anyway
They're fixing all their AT&T problems that have been there for 3 yard
Hehe, it's like a kitty :D
Years*
03Droid has never had Verizon problems
Their hardware is updated
Hey
A security guard kitty :3
grrrr >_>
03it's still inferior to other hardware
:>
oop, gonna get bit ar
/me cuffs Proto
and yes I have them
pff
So I don't see any reason to hate them anymore
03I do.
and no not the pink fuzzy ones
That thought never crossed my mind
Except that they refuse to speed up iTunes for pc's.
Well, now it is
I'm trying hard to learn about mIRC scripting
but it hadn't before
it's crazy-complex
That I can complain about
Not really.
Think of one good reason to hate them
Besides what I just said
if you get into DLLs and filehandling it is
...
Nevermind, then.
not to mention DDE handling
03There are lots of reasons.
03One, they charge way too much for what you get
Gimme one
Not anymore
03Two, even with "updated", other brands still make FAR technologically superior products
I'm trying to write a custom script to show what I'm playing in Winamp,
/me pokes the $150 8GB iPod Nano
038GB Sansa is like $50
03I fail to see your defense
and allow users to dcc download it, should they wish
Yeah, but does it do videos and radio
And Bluetooth
03Absolutely.
03wtf bluetooth
but that requires filehandling, DDE commands, and possibly tapping into Winamp's DLLs
I think it's a little above my reach
back
03but yes, Sansas have had radio since WAY before iPods have
back
03in fact APple kinda ripped that off them
02wb
03Sansas can even RECORD the radio
o.o
03as well as voice
03and it's like 1/3 of the pric
O_o
03e
Oh, IOS 80 still works, nevermind,.
12hi
What about audio quality
are you playing OoT?
12no
and hai~
kay
03a third reason: APple is like the leaders in CLOSED source, if you want OSX you have to buy their crappy hardware too
12i'm having difficulty
Good as any?
did you get the bottles?
03unlike Microsoft where you can just put it on w/e
oh?
12i got a bottle
do tell :3
12lol
good
03in fact for the sound-noise ratio, iPods aren'te ven that good
12phantom ganonfork
did you put a Fairy in it?
12no
you're an adult already?
o3o
12yes
What about physical activity music
ok
Like you do a lot o cycling like me
whats the trouble?
03what do you mean physical activity
And want to listen to music
03you mean does it use flash?
ty
Battery life and portability
038GB is not a hard drive, it has flash memory
03Plus
03Sansas have MicroSD card slots
03iPods have NEVER had that
That's what i mean
12i CAN
03you can easily double your space
12can't beat him
03with a simple card
does anyone have any experience with that stuff?
oh
12i can't wack the lightnings balls just right so they hit him back
03and that's just one particular mp3 player, there's lots of them LOL
how many hearts do you have?
126
What about other formats
no wonder XD
Not just .mp3
go heart piece hunting o3o
/me hmms
12i found like a billion heart pieces
12but i can't get them
03more than iPods have...
LOL
Stuff like .aac, wav
03it'll do mp3, m4a, OGG, etc
Meep
ok
03yeah
03it does those
03well wtf .aac
03it'll do m4a
03which is the same thing
03it'll do WAV
03and mp3, and mp4, and w/e
03most players will do more formats than iPods >_>
12right now i'm messing with TP
how many do you have on you?
I left my iPhone connected to IRC overnight
12trying to figure out what i'm doing wrong with fishing
/me hmms
How easy is it for an idiot to use?
Like say, my whole family
I haven't played TP in a time lol
but anyway
in OoT...
/me thinks
I did that omce
03LOL @ idiots
03ask LL, I sent her a Sansa
03I think it's just as easy to use as iPods
03plus you can actually put Rockbox on them :D
12no
03you used to be able to on iPods, but not in the past ... like 5 years you can't
What
03but you still can on Sandisk players
12i got one
!lag
12but i don't remember how i got it XD
what about the windmill?
12no
Ok, not too bad
O-O
What
re-race Dampe
Glac, I could help after I convince drf apple isn't that bad
get under 1 minute for a piece
Bbl going to play Angry Birds on my iPhone
then go to the windmill for the other
Aka*
03LOL
*up to the windmill
03So far I haven't seen any valid reasons why they aren't bad
Let's move on to the phone
03compared to other products
03EW IPHONES
12i'd much rather figure out fishing right now
03Android works better by far >_>
Why do you hate the iPhone?
Reason
kay
I need one
03First of all, no actual keyboard
2o.o
I can deal with that
03secondly, WTF only one button?
03if your phone freezes you're SOL
2lol
I'm using no keyboard right now
It's not all bad
03eh
03I've heard f people having their iPhones freeze and they literally have to wait til the battery runs out for it to restart
I would make the same mistakes on a real keyboard
03that's the other thing
03you can actually remove the battery of the DRoid
Yeah, like you'd keep your droid for the next 7 years
You won't need to replace it
/me reads
03what's your point
03batteries can die dude
03plus if it FREEZES
03you can just pop it out
03iPhones you have to like, hold buttons for a while, realize you're screwed, and sit and wait
03or maybe smash it
03that might also fix the freezing
If the iPhone freezes, it's your fauly
Just like a droid
03orly?
03ever heard of FAULTY SOFTWARE?
Harpy
02ALTAIR
03if the only thing you EVER use is the browser, maybe
/me snugs
Ya rly
03but obviously you'd get third party apps
03and those are known to freeze
NS!
/me snugs back
<_<brb turning autocorrect off
03see, my Droid doesn't need autocorrect, it has a keyboard
/me hides
Well some of us aren't that literate

03wtf?

03you can't spell words in English without a computer helping you?

03That's kinda sad

/me goes back to reading o3o

I was jk ing
02and add tohjofall's new button
02um

You're sad D:<
02http://s1.zetaboards.com/PokemonDistrict/site/
that needs to stop changing
02I know
02>>
03o.o
03whatever
03moving along, APple's computers
i'm not going to change it again
02oh wait
03maybe Alt can de it
02nvm
03you can take the same hardware and build a Windows or Linux machine for about half the cost
03do
02XD
03with even faster processors and whatnot
do what?
02And SpooKy should seriously
also :3@Snea
Hating a company for mistakes easily comparable to r corporations
s
03WTF $1000 for a MacBook? with only a 2.2GHz dual core?
Other*
02just use one url
02and reupload it
03You can get even like a $500 crap laptop with a faster processor than that
Well don't buy the f in thing
03I don't
The Mac mini
03what about it
If you want a Mac, you get it for osX
Not for the hardware
03that's beside the point
03if Apple weren't evil you could easily put OSX on your own built computer
03but you can't, which yet another reason I hate them :P
03that and OSX is stupidly annoying, I see nothing you can do in it that other OSes can't do
Well that's why they sell the freaking Mac
03yes, to quote a friend: people who use Macs have more money than brians
03*Brains
If they sold osX to pc users, it would be somewhere around $400
03so?
03WIndows is like $300 'full'
03I get it for free thanks to my school though
03not pirated, either
So would you spend that or just buy their frickin hardware with it
03I'd rather spend the SAME money and get BETTER hardware
The built quality is unmatched
03what>?
It'll last 10 years
At least
03orly
03my university has some Macs that are like 3-4 years old and are already sluggish and slow
those poor Macs
Ya rly
Well they've never heard of clearing their history
Another thing
Marketing
Apple markets the Mac to the mainstream tech idiot who doesn't know what start on a pc does
03every time someone restarts the computer it erases any changes made
03what history are you referring to?
/me doesn't :3
They expect that osX will do enough to last them
03I still don't see your point
03if you're an idiot, then sure get a Mac... but that doesn't make it a valid reason for me not to dislike them
03as I actually know how to use a computer
I was receding to temporary internet files last time
03I know
I do too
03but it ERASES THAT
03when you log off
03as do the Windows machines
Not really
lol
03yes it does
03you've never heard of a bootup image before?
I have
I think we got lost somewhere
03brb, regardless.
I used to be able to make a fork bomb and make %random% number scroll on the screen
Screw it
Believe what you want
Anyways, I got 2 new games today
Well not new, but still games
$19
a fork whuh?
Fork + Coke bottle + dry ice
:P
Assault :o
it has decent Multi IMO
<random>
I have a lot of nostalgia
For tha game
1p ish meh :/
My friends used to play multi all the time
I logged it
Loved*
It basically tells windows to open a file or run something in cmd or something like that, can't remember the details, and it just opens cmd prompts endlessly, can't do anything, the pc crashes
I did it to a junk school computer >.>
And yes, the campaign is Meg
Meh*
Totally unplugged that thing in about three seconds
And autocorrect is >_>
lol
So yeah
the only reason to go 1p is for the extra characters no?
Yep

why are almost all XP themes so corny
/j #wiihelp
...
7=3
!rules
Rules for #wiihelp:
1. NO PIRACY (or back-ups, don't go pretending, they are the same thing)! We're happy to help with getting the latest emulator to work but you'll be kicked (or banned) if you ask where to get ROMs etc. How to install VC / WiiWare games or asking where to get them will get you an instant ban as will asking for .ISOs or asking on support for modchips or any other piracy or backup-related topics.
(For the purposes of this channel, the term "softmod" shall be defined as "any software installable to the wii that will allow you to play illegally obtained wii games". Softmodding in and of itself is illegal, and therefore it and anything pertaining to it falls under the category of piracy. Softmodding does NOT mean "installing homebrew channel", "homebrewing your wii", or anything of that nature.)

You Have Been Spammed! http://www.qwertymash.com
(Further, a "hardmod" is the same as a softmod, except that it is a hardware chip physically installed into your wii. Together, these are referred to as "mods" and are therefore illegal and fall under the piracy rule.)

2. There is no need to ask 'Can I ask a question' - just jump straight in with it
3. No offtopic talk. This is particularly annoying for those trying to ask legitiate questions. There are other channels for off topic wii chat (try #wiidevot). Ops have the final word on what is and what isn't offtopic and offenders will be kicked and then banned
4. We have all the ops that we need - do not ask to be an op. If you are a regula helper you may be promoted to have voice and should we need more ops we will promote from there
5. No IRC scripts / bots without permission (but as long as the bot is not annoying or obtrusive, we will likely not decline). This includes autorejoin and away messages (apart from non-intrusive ones - ones that do not count as a real message, for example changing nicks or using /away)
6. Flooding / autojointhere are bots in place to stop this. Persistent offenders will be banned
7. No flaming (insulting / abusing other users)
8. For more detailed dev help try #wiidev and for low level info try #hackmii. #wiidevot should be used for offtopic. Do not post links to other channels apart from these (though if it is not piracy-related and will genuinely help, it tends to be allowed).
9. Our bots are here to help. Abuse of commands such as !seen and the searches will get you kicked.
10. Don't talk in CAPITAL letters, people will find this anoying and will only ignore you
11. Don't advertise websites or channels unless they contain useful information relating to the problem at hand. Always use Wiibrew if possible.

04what happened to GV's server on PO?
ripping discs is so slow
dont then
get iso
and put on
i'm in au, we have shit slow internet and download limits
hi guys
is there someone who would like to explain me why update partition uses IOS4 ?
It does?
It shoudn't be...
FFFFFFFFFF
but it does
for all games, older and newr
newer

04ty
Hello.
hi
Are everyone made of excellent?
Hi
ah..Found it!
wb
and how was the game lyon
04?
04good
Halo?
is it worth going to cios rev19?
still on 17 here
u have to
only if you encounter problems
have to?
i had to do
i stayed with 17 because it works with triiforce
17 then do 19 at the end
?
but i probably won't use triiforce now my hdd has been wiped
couldn't be fucked setting it all up again
besides using sneek for wiiware now
if everything's working, why'd you want to change stuff?
i notice some things won't read from usb hdd using 17
i think 19 solves that
try then
i will, was just wondering if anyone knew any compelling reason to switch or not
can't say, i'm not into usb loading
chrom
due to newer games
iu need rev19
isn't "things won't read" enough o a reason?
from what i understood with cfg loader
i need to clean my "f" key
rev19 finaly fixs DL support
somehow
but some other homebrew would complain about reading from usb
i think stuff like wad manager
anone got a rapid share accot i can use for about 25 mins
lol
get usenet
its cheaper
that ppl actually pay for that astonnishes me
rs that is
yeah I dont get the rapidshare
i just need it for tha ufc rls
no scene rls yet
I get free newsgroups so idc
otherwise it'd be 100% torrents
i use jDownloader for stuff like rs and torrents secondarily
torrents tend to clog my pipe :/
you mean UFC.116.Preliminary.Fights.HDTV.XviD-aAF or something else?
ya that only scene rls so far
there a newrls
already
UFC.116.ESPN.HDTV.XviD-FreaK )-( a.b.teevee )-( 29406 )
then make a test account on usenet and leech it
i dont fuck with usenet
or that shit dunno wtf to start at
get alt.binz enter your account name download the nzb and leech it :p

I have every series I like in its entirety, complete collections of all games for my favourite old systems (totalling over 800,000 individual games), a fair collection of films, music and so on and of course the wii stuff, even that only takes about 2.5TB, what the hell do you need 16 for
tnx
seriously
so am i
I have a pic somewhere
windows 7
seen what?
wot?!
(actually it was a wii iso but nvm)
ok, i had no config.txt
all sorted now

i tottaly forgot about my little steam collection
that
Already got that question like 5 lines ago
/me brbs
hm
since ive been running on lappys with intergrated video
lmao
its nice to have my rig back
it was actually about 24GiB if you wondered, but the displayed size is ridiculous there
something like that
but it was windows itself
i found a funny caramel dancen pic lol
the builtin zip support
ahhh
actually, this zip was really wierd
7zip failed to recognise it
i had to download winzip to unpack..
12lol
yes...
winzip 11 and later use a funny format
that's incompatible with every other zip tool
because they're arseholes
winzip is gay
coughmicrosoft
here is the link (i think)
wait
i'll keep this file
12o-o
and wait 50 years
12not really a links
then attempt to extract that 6PB
12more like half of one
:D
LOOOOOOOOOOOL you said links not link but it is so funny
alright here is what you do...
wont take 50 years to reach hard drive space of 6pb

Espeon; your negibhor hood watcher
/me jumps on zu zu then :)
Espeon, you never comment on my picture unless it has Espeon in it
...or House
Shiny: so hows my comment on your drawing?
12hyper b is a dangerous attack. eam.
/me 12flys with lugia
I honestly just saw your most recent one.
Because I just went on da <<
LOL almosy 6 30
126:29?
Best comment I've had in ages Brother
12we are going to the battle tower
04oh?
04OH
exactly Lucario
04YES
04HAHAHAHA
its 6:29 am o3o
04MY INTERNET IS BACK TO NORMAL SPEED
/me whoops
12so get ready for a battle nick
/me gives Drake the cake
Darnit, just a few more messages and you would've been kicked
12wait what D:
I don't comment as much as people seem to think... at least not anymore. And I'd love to give people constructive criticism but I have bad experience with it to say at least <<
/me would've laughed
and now its 6 30
04lolshiny
12nooo I bruise easily! *flees
04and Espeon, I'm the same
04except with Sprites
Same here
12(and besides we have to cut down on the rping in main chat)
I dont comment at all mostly
wait
12no we are going against weak pokemon nick
then that meaks you threw a lie :O
LIER
but in general dA is the wrong place to be if you want that. 95% of comments will either be praise or unconstructive critisism.
you can't deny this
12torchick,treecko and mudkip
I don't
I mean look what happened to Aurora XD
she asked for it
and only like 5-4 people did that
Yeah. You shouldn't really have to ask for it though :/
she's an artist for life
thats her deal
12well if its full of rattatas and bidoofs can I bring my minigun? VRMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM 9000+ dead ratatas+bidoofs
But then again, so many people aren't looking to improve... sad truth
12sure
actually here's my Communist bet
a majority of DA mostly exist
My pet peeve about comments are people who just post "Nice picture :)" and nothing else
to be Worshipers of several people
like take for example..
I mean, I would actually like to know WHAT'S nice about it
that one girl
who makes those spyro comics
In fact I agree Shiny. I mean if someone says like "Nice, I really like how the <stuff> came out :)" then it's instantly 100 times better
literally people just worship her art
True
that happens to many
In which I do say
DA is pathetic
the versions and changes?
and they get blinded and don't improve, and then they become stuck up bitches :3
who cares
at least if there is construction of art
I have a lot of people I look up to, but I don't worship them
I'm happy and jolly
I really facepalm at fanclubs for artists on dA
like really
Ha
hahahaha
/me doesn't go around kissing awesome artist's feet for nothing
^
and they say we created personality cults
DA is a site for that crap
>:3
ohai sir kipi
04Espeon
/me chews on the next person
I mean I had a period where I tried to be constructive
04if you facepalm at fanclubs for artists
over 50% of the comments got hidden
Not Zu Zu
why?
04would you facepalm at Fanclubs for a persons OC?
and/or their fanboys/-girls called me a "meanie"
/me noms his own tail.
Drake:
yes I would
:3
YES
04good
04because I did too
so hard that the wall behind me would fall
12>:3
theres one girl
04Go look at Shalonesk's page
I have
thats the girl
I knew you were gonna type somethin'
and may I say one terrible thing?
04there is a fanclub of her character, Zonoya, and another for two of her characters
So I interrupted ya
04and yes
04go
I understand that you like a certain person's OC
lol facepalm
Hyahahaha
she creates spyro porno
04I know
04although I've never seen hers
I have >.>
I died
04but I do know she does
04lol
well that explains part of her popularity
I mean, I know a comic artist who has watchers who've made stamps for her characters in her comics
and god did not resurect me 3 days later
he did it 5 days later
But hopefully not a fan club
04lol
/me sees her art and imagines porn in that style
04ewfanclub
what is this
i don't evne
04LOL
sadafgfsa
04Shiny
Espeon; she has done prono
04she's made a fanstamp of her comic
04which I find ok
in which she has her OC
and a character that has no sexual desire
04lol
Do a 'yiff'
great
I'm talking about someone else
04oh
/me headbashes
12>:3
04who?
Hell
as Drake as my witness
12Hey Pokipiki
she even purposely makes porno for us to see
So, Brother...
04lol
12:P
ever see her OC and another OC do it?
04that's generally why people make porn
I decided to go do something, specifically to defy you
12LOL POKIPIKI
04and ty Shiny
them get <censored> over her Giant breasts
may I be damned to hell for all eternity
12aren't names fun
lol wut
City of Blank is the comic she's working on
if they dare make a Soul Eater porno
And there's a couple stamps of her characters from it
04._.
I'm borrowing GTA4, just to hear you complain about how much you dislike it. >:3
Erm..
http://www.furaffinity.net/user/Shalonesk is this the same dickwad?
I have it dud
*dude
oh nvm it is
thats drf that complains about it
nice...scored me a wd-hdtv for $60
spliiiiiiiit
I even have the expansions and old GTA gaes
*Hames
*games
well well tl;dr people don't want to improve they want praise
You lie
YOU LIAR
Also
screw praise
Why don't you add me?
04^
Are you racist?
12yeah SR2>>>>>>>>GTA4
IS THAT IT!?
You hate me for no reason??
04tbh, I don't want to get better as an artist in general
What is wrong with you, Brother!?
04I just draw for fun, not as a life
12gta4 is a great game
unlike some people
/me dies
04sure, I'd like to get better in a few little areas
04but nothing major
Why must you judge me for the color of my skin, Brother?
I'm like Drake
I can barely draw
I've done nothing wrong!
My majors are in what are expected of me
in all honesty I wish I had the style of a 1930s Soviet artist
12except all the cars handle like the wheels are made of cheese and there is an elephant in the passenger seat. Made of concrete.
but I dont
so I deal with this
Hey, I draw as a life
I mean if you upload your art you should agree to the fact some people might want to help you improve.
Brother
Well, I plan to anyways
and that isn't done by saying "so kawaii"
add you where?
I will never trust you again
Never
04Espeon, I understand that, and if people want to help me, then I'll let them give me advice
Lucario: but hey
That's why I didn't run back here crying because Brother gave me critique
at least you can fly now :O
Espeon
12Loocareooh mah boi
12well i gotta go now bye
but I don't want them controlling how I draw or going "YOU DIDN'T TAKE MY ADVICE IDIOT YOU'RE GONNA BE A <censored> ARTIST YADDA YADDA YADDA"
if i hear one more person say that
dont pot tweak, just replace the laser
I will <censored> blow out my ears
12this aura is what all true warriors strivefor!
I
12You could before, it was called noclip.
loath
Kawaii
04looool
04what does that even mean?
nm that was an hour ago
I loath japanese phrases used by anime fangirls/-boys
I think it means cute
kawaii?
but it's like the master race of "cute"
It's Wapanese for chibi/cute
cuddly
big eyes, more bloom tool, and sparkly like a twilight vampire
04oh
Y'know, the K for the C!
04EWWW TWILIGHT
/me throws Lyon at it and then flees from the failure
wait..
04DDDDDDDD:
whats the word for idiots who act japanese
when they're clearly not
/me BURNS EDWARD AND BELLA! MUAHAHAHAHAHHAHA
I saw a picture that was relevant to twilight
weeaboos?
Yes
12who welcomes the statbsbot? xD
04so you've read Shalonesk's comic?
"weeaboos can burn in <censored> hell for all we care"
Yesw
04the Spyro one?
I have
04well
Fools.
Oh I thought you were asking for the actual Japanese word for idiot .-.
I've read every
single
page
04I find it really sick and twisted how Zonoya could like Malefor
>:3
thats baka
I know
04he's what, how much older than her?
OVER 9000
But then again
04that works
12shut up fool
besides
people make the most batshit insane couples
who in their right mind
/me steals Nick
and call them "canon" even
12Im getting sick of yo rap and Im about ta put the hurt on ya
would let someone
RAPE THEM
/me stores him in a jar
04Espeon wat
/me puts the hurt on kipi for nick thieving
Bah, it's like this one Pokemon fanfic someone wrote hoping that they could make a LatiasxRayquaza story
04Zonoya sorta wanted that
/me sells jarred Nicks on the streets.
thats called
stupidity
its also called
the only thing beating it is probably yaoi couples *shivers*
04Cynder just tries to tell her "He molested joo!"
a thing to get rid of in a GULAG

/me shudders at the word 'yaoi'
/me had already put the hurt on kipi
I need to tell you all now

I bet the word "hentai" makes you jump out of your seat then
but not because it girl on girl

You guys are all highlighting me with "Yaoi", "Yuri", and "Hentai" D:
LOL
XD
Burn the witch!
04LOL
what's the point using like 10 different "don't steal my art" stamps..!?
What?
It's a true-believer!
you thought there was a point?
I mean, non-believer!
Yeah...that!
dont you see; for her
there is no point
oh wait, it's their way of saying "I'M SO ORIGINAL I NEED THEM ALL"
the point is to praise our savior
Spyro
lol
he rose from the gamer grave and became our savior
he died for your hours
No...don't give Spyro a bad name
He's awesome in Playstation games
sonic, now that guy has a wacky fanbase
classicla spyro; I hope you arent used in that name
/me hides
When he was owned by Insomniac
Espeon no
no no no
ita worse
wtf? Camera offline?
Beyblade
lol wut
<Espeon> sonic, now that guy has a wacky fanbase <- Too many "Original Characters"
Has
/me shudders
someone was such a fan; he made himself
a new series .-.
sonic
ctrl + u hue 100 ??? profit
recolour 101
Shiny: they need to kill whoever is urkle
he did a voice in for spyro
in the adventures of sonic the headgehog
the 90s was cursed
Yet we all loved it
CSI Arti - check it out^^
what are you talking about
we all hated it
it had no sense
12XP restarted due to updates -v-
12I'ts back
not Sat AM
the other one
the insane one
04:\
That's because it took half our lives to make the shows slowly weaken into stupidity
its a good thing I was born in 95 then :D
Hurray for using Pokemon move references
Also, Lyon what do you think of The Last Airbender? (movie)
Drake: do you read her comic as well?
04er, that real-time one?
yes
the one with all the white people
Yes, that would be the movie
04I haven't seen it
04but my opinion so far, is 'wtf'
the girl that made the spyro comic
I second that
which has porn in it
04uh
I actually saw the behind the scenes, and this was their inspiration for making the movie:
I make the claim; why the white people and whats the point
a little girl
04Shalone doesn't have porn IN the comic
thats because she never posts it
but she made a little comic of the molest of zonoya
04ovo
lol
lets just say no one was a happy camper
04hurr
I misread zonoya as zorua EVERY time /random
04I doubt that, I'm sure alot of people were happy
Director: "Well, my daughter started watching this show, and she got me to watch it, so me and the group sat down and started watching Avatar the Last Airbender. We couldn't stop watching it, so I thought *Hey, we should make a movie of this* and so we all got to work on it"
..-.
04Hey, Director-man
04maybe try making an animated one next time
my response to director;
The style was completely off in the movie
try putting asians in next time~
I mean, this one scene, the water bending teacher who taught Aang, made this ball of water and KICKED IT
Too much earthbending in waterbending
and basically they have to have the element
to bend it
so no spontaious fire
Yeah, so fire benders can't just shoot fire out of themselves anymore, even though they explained why in the animation
Why asians? Avatar isn't even an anime o.o
Why?
for theres not only too many white people
Because the creators actually based it off of Asian culture and anime
But its suppose to be Asian oriented
Good thing it's quiet
based off the cultures of Asian
Otherwise I'd be too distracted to make illegal drugs.
and last time I check white people =/= Asia
I mean, Momo is Japanese for peach, which Momo was eating when Aang named him
The bending styles are all based off of kung fu styles
Also
drake: its offical
shes a narutard
04lol
a furry one to >>
I thought momo was pink... Ah well
Air Nomads have the same beliefs as Buddhism
*cough*pascifistidiots*cough
lol, narutards
also
who is this thorn guy
she makes all these pictures for him when dragons just apperently flop over for him
heck alot of people do that o.o
There was calligraphy in the show
04lol
04I knwo who 'Thorn' is based off
04so it makes it even scarier
04and yes, I know who you are talking about
Drake: who?
fot I have no clue
I'mm too..intelligent and resistent to drama
04you know Eragon? The Movie or the Book?
04Thorn is one of the dragons in it.
:|
So what
04The fact of how she draws him and what he asks for is SCARY
this guy thorn
LOL
i can make a dirty joke about that
but I resist it
04LOL
but its not just her
others do it
like 'sexycynder'
who I bet Drake watches :P
/me runs
04waitwhat
04who is this?
04wait I think I know
lol wut
dannish person
04I think I say her comment on one of CASF's picture
04pictures*
We neeed
more
who makes ANOTHER spyro comic
leapfrogging
cows
04LOL
which is about her OCs
04at least CASF is innocent
and the..

cynder-and-spyro-fan or something.
Guess I should just go to bed
and are you sure about that drake? o3o
and ok Shiny D:
her 'boyfriend' makes dirty pictures
showing dragon breasts
and all that
i dont even think I'm worth to be a teenager DD:
04waitwhat
04CASF has a boyfriend?
04and Espeon I'm pretty sure
Espeon, you better not have the move Flash
SexyCynder does
whose CASF?
04and gnight Shiny
04ooooooh
I dont know who CASF is
04CASF = cynder-and-spyro-fan
/me gets her dA
lol
04dragons don't have breasts
04they are reptiles
tell that to him
04[/science]
inorite :V
but in any case
04CASF is like, my ultimate art idol
I dislike "it's female, it must have breasts"
04^
what do you call big lumbs on her chest?
I dislike "It's female, it must have gigantic breasts"
and dont you dare say a dirty word
Espeon:
we think the same
only reality is against us
and Drake, I can't find anything bad about her so 1-0 to her I guess |D
04>.>
04<.<
04lol
04well me
04meh*
male-dominated art is male-dominated
04bah
12BBQs starting
04even girls do it
male-dominated art
is boring
04Shalone draws Cynder with breasts
04its scary
also, I like how in (be it dragonstuff or furrystuff) they always put ... human parts.
and a planet of fans cired out in anguish
and sunndely died
that sorta creeps me out
Furries
or well, not always but you know
04lolespeon
they apoloclypse of today
ESPECIALLY on the females. Always human parts minus the fur.
also lyon
04?
NDAHFOABDFLAGBDFOLSBFLAD
she drew this
?
04I see
04continue
04she drew what?
wait..wait
i know her
04?
Even she made a comic
04CASF?
04yeah
which made...more sense then the other two
npw I remember her
04only hers is much higher quality + takes longer for the next one to come out
plus
her art is good
04tbh I prefer cell-shading
impressive
04hey
04CASF's art is amazing IMO
She does really good art indeed.
oh look
I found another OC card
also lol at her icon
04lol
facepalm
wat
lipstick on a dragon
srs
Sexycynder
not the greatest artist
or originality
her art..well I can't be mean
srs
04mind = scarred
Drake you review it o3o
WHAT THE <censored>?
this is her
you said a dirty word :O
:V
but yeah
remember when I said she did thorn?
she does alot of other OCs
kissing OCs
04...
04._.
04ok
and the vid's gone again
still, lipstick + dragon = no
^
04if your OC has a love interest woth another OC, I'm fine with that, as I have done that myself
No
they dont
04sorry
the point is to just create art, its a request
?
no an art trade
04let me rephrase that
Absol: but guess what
they wear clothing too
04if your OC has a love interest with another of your OCs, I'm fine with that
so its lipstick + clothing + dragon
04...
04HOLY SHI
04wtf
04that is scary
Drake: thats shakolenaldbakd girl
04clothing + Dragon is ok if done right
o-O
in which thats her preview porn
04but....LIPSTICK?
inorite
:
yes lipstick
:V
my work
but just wait till you see her comic
malifors past
of how he became Darth vader
04do I want to see it?
its not like the other one
its semi
if you can stand it
comic page
04bah
thought so
04all this talk of comics, Spyro and porn has reminded me I have to write DoI
isnt it just sad
that Spyro is dead?
just wait till his movie
04...*shudder*
04waitwhat
04Spyro's not dead o.O
they say they're making a spyro movie
well in all terms
04they aren't
04it was a rumor
the originality and purity is dead
04ohlol
ah..at least no movie
spyro movie
+ results from avatar
=
fans die
04tbh I liked the new Spyro games
I barely played any of them
I had one
but I lost it at some point
well did they have to put wood in there?
couldnt they find another actor?
...?
I dont want to imagine spyro being frodo
Absol: the 'new spyro'
is made by elaijah wood
aska
04he is voiced by Elijah Wood
*aka
Frodo from LOTR
04I actually like how Elijah voices him
04Cynder's voice actors from ANB and DotD were pretty good as well
04TEN...meh
I don't play games much
04anyway
and none of them really interest me incredibly a lot
04I'm gonna attempt to force myself to write
even if I had enough money to buy any
with what?

Yes. And u can downgrade 4.3 to 4.1.
i know im not wulfgar ^^
oh, inclusive 4.3 then
10what?
yes but only if u downgrade to 4.1
ok fine
why?
10why u glare at us?
Why downgrade?
ESPEON
X3 He thinks we look good.
not sure if im going to find any locally
I NEED UR HELP
10o.o;;
4IM A SHE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
its not possible to hack 4.3 YET
That's what I said.
4DID NOT!!!!
10ok...
You just can't install HBC on it.
ESPPY
yes
You misheard me or something then, because I clearly said "she".
sorry, im missing something, i though you said that i can downgrade to 4.1, and then it is exploitable...
/me squints
but everything u hack is addicted to hbc
06:29 X3 She thinks we look good.
4no tou sentance said "HE"
See?
whats is hbc/
?
i think so yes
I just copied and pasted it right there
hbc is a hacked channel wich reads ur sd
oh ok
o.O
and then u can install hacks from the sd
and everything else
It has a timestamp so you know it's the real deal.
but u can update to 4.2 if it isnt possible to hack 4.1
/me 4lookes up to find she almost got hit by a meteor
and then u can hack 4.2
yes, i did use that dummies guide to softmod a wii b4, now im considering a new wii, but not sure if an exploitable ones are still available :)
4.1 is hackable.
Just make sure you install the correct IOS before you "Downgrade"
:P
u have to downgrade the correct ios to downgrade the wii
so downgrading IS installing other (old) ios´
Or you'll brick.
4hi two people i dont know ^^
yes, i will remember that :) i think in the old one, the wrong IOS or something was installed, so the wii was 1/2 brick << not sure if this make an sense...but it was pain to fix it...
/me listen 'Love the Way you Lie' 'Eminem'
xD
Good thing Kyu isn't really there.
just install the system menu
again
with a hack
Which menu?
the system menu u have
thnx guys

yes
no
you can't use ps3/xbox controllers on wii

u can play snes with ur wii mote
That would take custom drivers.

there are two guides.. one for 3.1-4.1 and one for 4.2
None for 4.3?
Whoa, bro.
no
you can't softmod a 4.3 unless it was softmodded before updating to 4.3
Now that is too many ?'s.
u have to downgrade 4.3 to 4.1
Are you TRYING to anger the ? God?
lmao Youtube gets more messed up every minute
? downgrade
really?
You could always use korean IOS.

i didnt know that
Apparently ninty didn't update them with 4.3
/me listen a funny song
im afk
/me 4listens to
/me 4laughs
? downgrade
/me listen EMIN3M with Underground
nice :)
Someone could make a TBR mod.
I could downgrade from 4.3, if MMM didn't turn off my wiimote, and then refuse to sync it.
10brb
MMM?
you need to have a cios installed to downgrade 4.3
MultiModManager
Nope, I found a guide for doing it without.
/me shakes his head, drying his hair through the dog method.
obviously doesn't work if you can't sync your wiimote after running MMM
Have to use exploits in either SSBB or Lego Indiana Jones.
It does sync for some people.
which is why it's not supported here
And it would if I had a GC controller... :(
What would having a GC controller do to help sync it?
watch the TST meet livestream on http://nest.lugia.us:8080/?src=1
GC controllers always seem to work, even when wiimotes fail to sync.
4ok

heh
okay, what's your question?
Is that mean?
can u help me?? i have no idea how to install hbc
/me 4thinks nobody on chat likes her
What version of the system menu are you on?
4.2
/me 4is upset
E
Okay, well
/me pets
Do you have an SD card handy?
/me 4dosent eat anything for a whole day
yes and i allready copied hackmii_installer onto the root
err
have you copied bannerbomb onto it?
no
http://bannerbomb.qoid.us/abds/abd6a_v200.zip
bu i dont have the game either
/me 4dosnt care about herself
Download that, and unzip it, so that the private folder is on the root of the SD card
ok w8
/me 4cries
done
okay
Now
Move boot.elf to the root of the SD card
(boot.elf is inside hackmii_installer)
ok
Oh, by the way
When you copied the private folder, did you ALREADY have a private folder?
/me 4talks to imanimate items
no
Okay then, you should be all set
Put the SD card in your Wii and hit the SD card menu button on the System Menu homepage
is the wii region free?
load boot.dol/.elf?
probably yes
Yes.
i can get ntsc/u or pal, so i was curious...
hackmii installer appeared now
hit continue?
Yes.
Do you have any red text on your screen, below the green text?
? brickblocker
i think it was not red but it sid something like i kould only be installed using iso ...
yes
i was bootmii
you can change video mode it outputs as with somthing like cfg loader
ohay~
there ARE some games that are region locked
O_o
ios it was
it's always recommended to get games that match the region of your wii
?
yeah, okay.
nothing
ok hbc and dvdx where installed
4hello?
thnx, pal is cheaper so i will get myself one then
were you asking for a stock wii?
have a happy and safe 4th everyone
not hacked?
cause thats a diffrent story
yes
buy a wii that matches your region
stock
^
if you're in the states, get an ntsc wii
isnt hacked wii region free...?
no
ooooh
what should i do about bootmii?
:)
install it as IOS, if you want
i prefer ntsc because of the games are usually released b4 other regions, all my consoles are imported although im in a pal region
since the N64 days :)
ok all done i think
if you're in a pal region, then get a pal wii
not to mention pal voltage
do i have to do something els
in my house we have both 110/220, it is the standard here to provide the 2
ciao
i prefer the ntsc, unless as you guys said there exit a utility that will convert the pal wii to ntsc, pal wii is cheaper here
again...if you're in the pal region, get a pal wii
if you're in the ntsc region, get an ntsc wii
it's really not THAT complicated
you CAN run most ntsc games on a pal wii...especially if you're going to use a usb loader
i am going to use a usb loader
yes
so ok
then I recommend getting a wd passport usb hdd, best around imo
lol
?
yup^
or very cheap enclosure and 750GB WD internal HDD :)
essentials are nice
750gb is major overkill for wii
anyone want to be in my picture?
yep yep
if you're going to use the usb hdd JUST for wii, 320gb is more than enough
i think the difference in price is not that much between the 500 and 750
hai
keep in mind that not all enclosures are compatible with the wii
OH MY GOD MY PARENTS >_<
i can only have about 4 or 5 buddies in my picture
even 500gb is overkill
I'll be back at like 5:00 maybe

you can use an many partitions as you want
but for the wii its fat,fat32,ntfs,wbfs

fat32 all the way
? softmod
fat32 fir the homebrew
there's no need for ntfs
o.o
.-.
size limitation
is anyone ther hello
there is no need for ntfs
convert .iso to .wbfs, throw on fat32 formatted usb hdd and play
i like to archive on my drive too wulf
i think fat32 does not support files larger than 4 GB
I'm talking strictly wii
i put my HD movies on there aswell
I'm here
the best thing about fat32 is that it is well documented
if you're going to partition a drive, then use fat32 for wii and whatever for the rest
well, why not?
compared to ntfs for instance
7sure
03à¹Í¡Ì¯à¹ï´¿
eh? something else but that?
ahh works thanks a lot
yes lugia is to hard
7hmmmm....
programs auto split 4gig files
but if you plan to stream movies and they are larger then 4gigs then go NTFS
7Electrike?
if its just for wii games Fat32
if you're streaming, they won't be on the usb hdd anyhow
im a girl rayquaza with a neakelace that shows a sun behind a cloud
i meant coping movies to your harddrive to watch them :P
instead of streaming
electrike will do
:)
Wii can't handle streaming movies that are > 1gig
wii isn't hd anyhow...so why you'd want to put a hd movie (bigger than 4gb) on your usb hdd is pointless
wifi too slow
dunno in fact^^
I stream 1.5gb movies just fine
chose a random one
/me 7changes her mind "Buneary seems more fitting for me."
it can handle low quality streams no matter what the size. but streaming a DVD or HD kills it
as I said, wii isn't HD anyhow...so why you'd wanna play a HD movie on it is beyond me
please?
meh
even non HD DVD's stream for crap...
it's a meh, not more and not less
if converted to XVID work fine
Floof has arrived!
so i just make an electrike
skylands wanna be in my pic?
if you want HD, get a wd-hdtv
12We're heading off to the arcades now so sorry for the lack of webcam

we need to own our politicians
our govt is by the people for the people
repubs want to shit on that idea so they can spill oil and not pay for that shit
he aint the only one
who do you want to pay for election campaigns: your tax dollars, or BP
it's your choice
no matter who you vote for the government wins
do you want a GOOD government or a NON EXISTENT government ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
non existant
no man should tell another what he can and cannot do whatever his intention good or bad
so you want anarchy everywhere, huge corporations with private cops, no street lights, etc
actually anarchy if you study believes in small government
so no
I guess in your opinion people don't deserve cops or laws or any social protection at all
fire engines
streets
indeed
no cops for certain
there are nothing but the states inforcers of tyranny
well you sir are certainly not listening to enough Thom Hartmann
or Randi motherfucking Rhodes for that matter
randi rhodes the 2bit ozzy osbourne guitarist?
nah the other one
the left wing talk radio host

she's the best
i dont like being brainwashed
whynot
i like to form my own thought and theorys not someone else's
you're in england ? ? ? ? ? ?
indeed
aren't there a million cameras taping your every move ? ? ? ? ? ?
yes
[13:25] <jse> actually anarchy if you study believes in small government
Huh?
anyone know what i need to play old nes games on my wii
Anarchy = no government
not true
if I was in England I'd be fucking pissed at the gillion cams everywhere
i got alot roms
fuck that shit
I would carry a "fuck you big brother" sign everywhere
? wiibrew
till they send me to guantanamo
Um, yes, true.http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/anarchy?r=75
well get involved
or else that shit happens
no matter who you will pick to govern they will do the same shit
perse do some study of emma goldmen
her speaches and writings
can anyone help me to put nes roms on sd card and play them
roms or vc wad's ?
i got roms
http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Nes
ill check it out
need to download the emulator and extract it to the apps folder on your sd card
i just make a apps folder and a roms folder on my sd card
Isn't there a sort of "flag" that allows me to delete the Forecast Channel via the Data Management screen?
not quite
what then
you want it like this sd:\apps\nes\
/me is away (***Obey the darkness inside you***)
create that and in that dir you want the files from the rar
like boot.dol *.png *.xml ect...
not quite sure lol
create a folder on sd called apps
ok done
in there create a folder called nes
in there extract the files from the emulator
whats the best emulator
look like for some reason that the emulator will not load games from sd
you can either burn them to dvd or load them of the network
so it wont work from sd card
the emulator will
ok
roms wont according to http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Nes#Loading_Games
whats the best emulator
that one i believe
but vc is probably better
as its a devd by big n
"ROMs & saves files should be stored in fceugx/roms and fceugx/saves on the root of your SD card, USB flash drive, or SMB share. "
learn to read
ok
i am reading

/me growls at Espeon

your new overlord

04and start it up again but set a limit on the number of people who can join
04does 20 sound good?
there's nothing like a "normal" pattern. It's just an "average" we like to use as "normal". But this doesn't make everthing standing outside of this "average" state equal to be "bad", "wrong" or sick
30 should work.
12Right the photos are resized, time to sort through each one
take me for instance. Few people like Lugia and other of those wonderful beings at my age. It's not target for this average group, yet I'm not "sick" or such
arti...that thing you said about leaving maybe i will leave
thogh - if I was infected by a disease because I admire Lugia that much, then hell, I'm proud of being sick!
03it's not that I don't want you here, you just act like a little kid
12She is LOL
03exactly
12Not that it's a bad thing
12Just that it's not really tolerated in places like this
so are you sometimes drf :P
:(
03I've always thought people start using IRC at WAY too young of ages LOL
03I mean, if you act mature that's fine
03but eh
so your calling me childish
03yes
04i don't think 30 is severe enough
o3o
hmp
04sigh
04this is the reason i was afraid of making the server public
bonsoir
04sure strangers are joining now but i haven't seen any of them really join because they have an interest
04they either join because the official server is down or to just be a random troll
lol
here have a nice glass of lemonade drf
04i can't wait until Presea can takeover
articuno im doing a picture of you
and me aswell
lol

Arti
/me topples on top of Articuno
woah, what's with that name o--o
xai is watching top gear
no, yours
Anyone around that i can ask some quick noob questions to
would greatly appreciate
oh soz nothin
ask
First one... Ive flashed a 360 drive before plenty of time.. was looking to get a wii... are the black ones able to soft mod
bbl
And should i flash them before i even turn it on out of the box or does it not make a difference
xai i am finished now
arti
in order to softmod a wii you have to turn it on ;)
lol thanks..
all able to play online correct?
yep
yes
i got the g.f begging me for a wii and i aint about to go buy 50 games lol
um articuno?
i have a external 1.5 tb hard drive that will work?
yes
most likely
and it will be OVERKILL
you don't need more the 500mb
u need to format in fat32
u only need 500 gigs
not true
anything else will be to much
you can do NTFS/FAT32/WBFS
u can use nfts but u could run into problem
for new black wii
4/2u nfts wouldnt work right for me
if xai askes for the link send it to him ok
so i had to do fat32 then wbfs
ntfs has nothing to do with black or white wiis
holly shit
aurora?
like i said i had problem using nfts with my black 4.2u
it might be you :)
given him a head up since he has one
well thats you
naw it anit me u fool
its the hardware (hdd) not the wii
well youre the fool, moron
moron rolf
yes?
enjoy ur pos
have you got a drawing request im dtrawing pokemon you see

Floof has arrived!
hey skylands
10Heya
well the japanese animators animate lip movement so they speak japanese
this EPIC japanese background music, this summoning song giving the scenes such a DENSE atmosphere...they MUTED it out almost ENTIRELY
12Yep
12Well look what they did to Revelation Lugia
are they brainf***ed or what?
12Destroyed a beautiful soundtrack
same goes for the first Movie
12Yeh.. wow
03Articuno, what
or who do you think would be DUMB(!!!) enough to CUT a 16:9 movie into a 4:3 aspect ratio?
12Now that was a dark movie, until the dubbers got hold of it
03Pokémon 2000 dub has like
03the best score ever
03:)
Articuno those photos are really good
03that's VIZ.
12It's not bad.. but it's too ... I dunno something
6I agree with drf
12Revelation Lugia is a lot better
6except pokemon 3 is better
6by far
03I even have it in high definition
12Like the bad guy actually has bad guy sounding music

12Thing is Im going out soon anyway
12:(
03the first movie, I dunn
03o
03though I seem to recall it being widescreen
14Tis all good though, I had a friend meet me from the station
03I was only like 7 though
14:>
03bbs/l
03so I can't really recall

cute
she says that we have to be at the lake by 6pm atleast.
/me runs around over here with Felix in a plastic bag too <3
its going on 4pm.
because it can
trust me, it WAS 4:3 aspect
cool
arti can you do a small request
03well again
what server?
03I don't think that's the fault of the dub
in all other but the japanese version. The japanese was 16:9 of course
03but the release studio
03either WB or VIZ.
she said we were having biscuits and gravy for dinner she has to make that from scratch.
03VIZ is fricking evil, I wouldn't put it past hem.
03oh really?
we have to find a coke cooler and go buy ice before we o, we have to finish getting everything together since we'll be out at the lake for atleast 4 hours
03VIZ is also known as Shokukgan (w/e the splling is), it's Japanese ;)
hum
but what is she doing playing cards for 5 hours.
Viz is an adult themed UK comic
articuno?
12If it's an art request then no sorry
12I only make art when I feel like it
Shaymin.
"The flowers all over its body burst into bloom if it is lovingly hugged and senses gratitude."

Smart girl. If she had prod me again, I would have removed my pants <.<
right now i'm playing GH3
/me grins.
/me prods again.
Eeevil!
/me removes his pants and puts on some other pants.
/me steals the other pants.
with a normal guitar xD
not thse bricks at the arcade
Ohsnap
Fine :(
/me curls up naked.
:3
You should ask them!
14LOL
14Those Guitars in the arcades today failed like hell
14Way too much lag
14Either that or just majorly unresponsive
and srsly heavy
no I need to convince the nation to join my voice
14The weight of them doesn't bother me
14Well
14It does
14Since I'm used to those lightweight ones
14But the arcade guitars just fail
14Way too much lag and stuff
yeha
14But damn
14I saw a song on the arcade GH
14THAT I REALLY WANT TO PLAY
/me puts on the previous pants!
!rules
No.
/me takes those, too.
`D:
/me eats them.
No?
:((
14And that's this
No!
wasnt on the normal game was it?
14No :<
o.o
14It's not on my Arcade machines either D:
o_O
myaaawn
What? D:
Why would you sit under a naked fat man? D:
Why are you sitting under him? D:
14And wow at Leeds' GH Arcade, the premium songs need £4 to play :|
ohai PS
bleh
14They only need £2 here
Why not? D:
!!!
14I thought that was pathetic man
what a rip
14£4 to play just one song
14and the premium songs suck anyway
I want my flashlight =[
to be honest i think arcades in general are bit of a con
14The only thing in an arcade that ISN'T a con are the DDR Machines
i was sad they removed the pool table, as that was the only thing i wanted to play :P
14XD
14I mis playing pool
o.o
/me huggles?
:3
/me lights his shoes on fire
14But anyway guys it really was awesome to see you all again
likewise
14Wish I could've stayed longer tbh
14I don't think I've had that much fun since the November meet XD
just wondering if there's already a fix for 003 unauthorized access error ?
14And Andrew it's ok for you, you can basically see Arti and Xai whenever :P
/me eats the cup.
14You don't have to travel for 4 and a half hours on a train XD
:3
14But yeah, what I'm trying to say is, that I will attempt to make every meet from now onwards
14Not only does it get me away from Southend and all the crap I'll deal with, but I have more fun up in Leeds than I would with my friends here
14And that says alot
:Ð· / :Ð / :3 / :Â³ / Ñ: / E: / :Ð­ / Ð: / :Ñ

14Sneas!
14:3
14^^
:)
is there an IOS downloader that actually works in linux?
14The best thing about the Summer Meet
Hi
why downgrade?
:o
KITTY!
14I was able to stay for a weekend
what?
That probably means that she is no longer curled up in my lap :o
oh yeah
14I don't think I could ever thank Arti and Xai enough for that ^^
/me wraps a towel around his waist and wears it like a kilt.

Hiya Nick =3
/me gives Proto a fireball.
/me bursts into flames
Brother, we're getting ready for a barbeque
Yeah, you're going to have to wait for a wii game with 4.3K
Gee, thanks
Update on it
we got lots of stuff, including explosives
Then use the rescue menu to install 4.3
happy explosives day
XD
and the new spiderman will be in the high school years like ultimate spidey so says IGN
I slept most of the day
which means we'll be getting scrawny spider-kid :\
Nick: they better not screw that one up
If I think it's the right error...
Bieber, quit being a dumbass
sundays always seem to be boring :<
looks lite this channel topic says 4.3 is out ? any idea which games use 4.3 ?
:p sorry
Flames!
/me sets himself on fire!
None have it on disc yet, I'm afraid.
i was bored peace
Yay for being a part-time fire elemental!
ultimate spider ma was at least semi good in my view
bummer :s
raaaaaandy said you stole 'baby baby' from him Bieber
I'm not going to ban you if you say yes, I'm trying to help.
I didnt like the ultimate series, I liked the sort of 90s cartoon where he was actually a man, and seemed like buff and strong, not that skinny style
I have one in my wii, after all. Ahh, the days where the hbc could be installed via trucha'd dvd.
i guess only softmodded, only neo... was on the menu screen
Ahh
I dunno :o
meh the 90s cartoons animation was...well not tha good
I think she is alive.
it was good in plot
I still have hosting from her!
but the animation coud have least been worked on
and hbc was also installed
in the 3rd spiderman movie he turns emo
Well, you're gonna have to wait for a disc with 4.3K
Sorry.
they should have shown more Venom in that movie
everyone got screentime but him XD
I thought the animation from the 90s was pretty good they did seem to put detail into the character models
no problem ... i guess it wouldn't be so much time untill 4.3 will be on a disc
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/08/raaaaaaaandy-gets-ripped_n_489971.html
I dont mean like character detail
btw is there any way to downgrade from the rescue menu to 4.1 or so ?
more like if you watch it for a really long time
:o
you see all of this repeats in animation
It was a L!
No, don't think so.
Yes!
Oh, ok. D:
oh yeah the recycled animation
all shows do that
Grr
and you havent seen that 'ultimate spider man' anime right?
my GOW disk is buried
needs more spider pig tbh
^
Which one? D:
Both!
D:
They are covered in too much hair!
You will never make it!
D:
It's a jungle down there!
And there is a Scar there who keeps welcoming people D:
but yeah Nick the newer anime, or cartoon, is bascially like the skinny version
super skinny
/me eats the scar.
floof floof floof for Roara
theres a spidey anime?
try saying that three times fast
the floof as left the building
Yes nick
D:
I miss the sea of floof
well its more like a cartoon
But it covered pretty much the whole of my right knee :/
/me bleeds to death.
only its better then most cartoon animations
and i believe I found the first youtube user who sounds like a robot
D:
God.
I am bored.
Yes?
Oh
Just ignore me.
Hi!

I'm am seriously going to attach a miniature chainsaw to a rifle

I start to understand why there're over 500 quoteable lines in the japanese version, around 300 in the german and 12 in the english version....
/me is rather sleepy.

and the german trailer afterwards: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rmsi1TV2KxU
Meh, ordered a GC controller, so I can downgrade from 4.3 in a couple days.
despite you don't understand everything (or even not a single thing^^") in the german anime, tell me afterwards which one covers more story and gives you more idea of the atmosphere
Yay!
/me mixes it into ice cream and noms!

It sounded like Kim was making the chainsaw noise
I shot the grunt he was trying to saw, but he was making the noise still ._.

The plot was decent, but a li'l rushed
bah
/me pokes May.
the emulation speed
I knew the movie wouldn't be any good
And the 3D wasn't very prominent so you barely noticed it
oh my bad
anything never is when it's based off something LOL
the actual game seems to run full speed but the video does not which is pretty annoying
I should just buy a ps2 and be done
what is you video card ?

the video card is not the issue
the CPU is
how be you the b'ox this afternoon?

I happen to like my steak like that

I even picked it out for my grandmother and got it adopted, and this is the way it treats me

siameses have great personality though, I've got two

it pooped on me while chasing a female around
then all the 6th graders tried to wrestle everyone around watching as that poor girl got attacked by a bunch of sparrows

PG13 technically includes sex and mild swearing
Yay!
maybe we should drop the rating down to G
/me continues.
But that'd ruin the fun. D:

This is the second time this has happened
I lost all my TT movies and Matrix
04that sucks
TT is about 11GB, almost 12, and Matrix is about 4GB
;;
So well
Are you on an admin account?
04TT movies?
Teen Titans
XD
04oh
So
04and yes
Ok
Wait
04I'm using Vista though
Are you using your government laptop? o.o
04nope
Vista and 7 are just about the same
alright
well
04I never use my givernment one
open cmd
04government*
I'm only using mine since I have like
no other choice
.-.
I got my 7/8 year desktop working
04anyway
but it has like 400MHz and 240MB of RAM lol
04cmd is open
yep

I mean
start regedit
04regedit?
yes
the registry editor
04...wat?
once you have that open
don't <censored> around
since you can kill your computer
04wtf is that?
it's basically what defines components of your programs
04...ok...and how the hell do I open it?
you alright opened it lol
by typing start regedit
in cmd
04k
or you could go to system32 and find the program
XD
04its opened
alright
go to HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
and click on the little arrow beside it
it'll open a whole dropdown menu of stuff
scroll down til you find the one called .exe and click on it
04done
04and I swear NS if this screws up my computer...
Don't worry, I've been <censored> around with some of my computer's registries for quite some time now XD
I killed them about 5 times
Anyway
what's inside it?
04Name: Default Data: exefile
04wait
04screw that
04something called 'Default' and something called 'Content Type'
that's fine
click on the arrow beside .exe
and it should say something like
PersistentHandler in the dropdown
click on that
what's inside it?
04(Default)
o.o
What's the data?
if you cbb to type it
since mine is a string of random chars and such
04yeah
right click on the thing
04a string of random characters
then modify
and copy it from there
DON'T EDIT IT
04I'm not

Also, IE truly fails
? usbloader
04lol
04so...I can close them?
go ahead
I need to VNC :/
I apparently don't have permissions to load exes on this computer other than the installed programs' exes
04hurr
so I can't load the VNC viewer
>>
04thus why I don't use my school laptop
And I actually really need it
Drake
04not to mention it sucks and it lags so much
Do you think I WANT to use this piece of <censored>?
04no, I'm just saying
obvious, much
it lags so badly it's not funny
and it uses up a LOT of CPU and RAM
04is yours a Mac or a Windows?
a lot more than it should
windows 7
04oh wonderful
04we have Macs
04Damn rainbow wheel of death

http://pokemon.marriland.com/hgss/pokedex/pupitar/
04Vista is annoying to use, but the rest of the Laptop makes up for it
I don't like Vista and 7
I remember what it is :P
They're harder to use
I can barely find the retarded Local Disk (C:) and My Computer on this
and where the <censored> is my documents and the local C drive anyway
>>
04:|
And where is the 'Run' thing
that XP has
that was actually good
it meant I didn't need to scroll up to find notepad and MSPaint and cmd
I'd just go run -> cmd
or run -> notepad
or run -> MSpaint or run -> calc
yes I'm that lazy
I can't even be bothered to scroll up the start menu to find those programs
and yay, CGI:IRC fails
Can't install mIRC or anything for that matter on this fail of a computer
why it's even called a computer astounds me
also
04?

04k
ive been googling for hours, and i, as a wii homebrew noob cannot find any tutorials on cios or anything like that
my problem is im using the hermes install (because i cant find a link to wiigator's) and it crashes when i select any ios slot
it just hangs until i reset the wii
and my internet is working
I feel like I should try playing a game soon.
Since all the crash-laws seem to be out of order anyways.
:P
thats why i kban asap and pm them to take it elsewhere ;P
:P Nice
What did he do wrong?
erm...asking how to do pirate crap???
cIOS is useful for more than just pirate stuff, right?
right, but i looked up the specific stuff he was using...its all usb loader and backup loader shit
/me arms
I guess so then.

they might be sentences that don't actually state anything
:O
THat game looked like it sucked and failed horribly.
I'm so behind on video games ._.

Wow, /b/ is evil
/me sends bees armed with bb guns to bombard /b/
:D
alliterationness
alliterative appeal~
oh god, 14yr olds on IRC can be...urgh
When I first joined ChatSpike I was 14 :o
lol
And practically went to channels that were massive cyberorgies!
Those were fun.
Being that my family didn't own a computer until I was 17 that's when I joined IRC
But this kid
!cmd /server localhost 6668
-_-
dem cocky boys
NS
ohwait are you actually there :V
? list
hewwo?
yes?
yah Raggy?
sorry, I've been kinda migrating computers
coolness
hai
hi
XD
!pokemon
!digimon
lol lag
I think this may be the first time I've been in a position where I may get moderator on a semi-well-known forums site
:V
:O
nice
which site?
Gang Garrison 2 forums
and also, Drake, can you check GV's PO server?
indie game
04?
04k
never been on it XD
http://www.ganggarrison.com/forums/index.php
might get mod of clans :V
I suspect it's blocked
oh
:O
right
:V
wait
04NS
04it's working
yah?
ok
btw
what kinda computer are you on
:V
Can you post on GV saying that the new direct url for the PO server is shadow.ambernova.net:5080 and that I might not be coming on for a while?
@ Drake
I'm on this retarded gov laptop
er wat
why
:V
04wait
04how do I set the topic?
04ohwait nvm'
04I thought you were talking about the PO server
.-.
/me headbashes
Only I can do that lol
or via a command in the PO client window that admins can do
berb
but it's dodgy
well
apparently spooky wants me to set up a PO server for TF
o_O
which I'm completely fine with
I swear
except what the <censored> do I do
He tries to copy HoR in every way
Well
wb
wb
.
k
o.o
Interesting...
Anyway
Yeah
Download the server
install it
it's already on there
then go to config
o.o
wb
It seems that I've "fixed" the Photo Channel
I uh what
o-o
wb
And then just config it from there
It keeps connecting to flame.ho-ohrealm.net
it's fairly simple really
strange
o_O
what address are you using
I have both in the list
shadow.ambernova.net port 6697?
both what and what
but it seems to prefer this one even if I reorder the list
o_O
might be closer
flame.ho-ohrealm.net 6697, shadow.ambernova.net 6697
I don't know where Altair lives
04waitwaitwait
not off the top of my head anyway
It's my client, I'll just delete flame from the list
04NS, that means we use that URL in the advanced connection part of PO?
o.o
uh, why?
shadow.ambernova.net:5080 at Drake, yes
04ok
if the public part isn't working
oh
04just making it clear
server just moved to a new computer
just /server shadow.ambernova.net:6668
testing ports lol
6668 works
I never used the server list
I need SSL tested
ohwait
yeah
oh that works
I was going to correct myself
.
6697*
you mean 6697
k
XD
:V
XD
Are you using XChat?
Quassel
berb
/me blinks
Never heard of it XD
http://quassel-irc.org/
it's awesome
the core runs on a server and it always connected to IRC
nice
sorry
then the client connects to the core and just restores where I was at when I closed it
assuming that my wii dvd is d3-2, can i replace it with a dvd that does support dvd-rs?
I've been computer migrating
nice
and anything you do in one updates the other
I joined irc about a year and 18 weeks ago~
1 year, 18 weeks, 3 days, 05:45:47 ago + a week or two
/me joined in March 2006, maybeh?
ChatSpike it was then.
From which I was invited to Epic-Chat once :o
Or many times.
o.o
<censored>, Drake, I just realised I lost all my PO teams XD
04...
04D:
Don't worry
I know what was in them
Not sure if I can remember the exact order of things and that's where I'm lazy XD
/me makes a list of what teams and their moves and such
:o
I can't really remember my electric team so meh
Hai, StoneAri!

so i need a good dvd+rdl, correct layerbreak and booktype.
that's what i was asking
guides tell to use +
i layerbreak and booktype ?
um
why burn to dvd?
you mean hdd
dvd is easyer to use
easier*
nope
usb is easyer
ok Shadow about my hdd it is NTFS
no figing out what format and what to burn at
and what media to use
is it easier or easyer my english suck but i wnat to know :P
easier
THX :D
ok Shadow cna you tell me why it is telling me to format ? (the usb loader)
i dont have to format is that right ?
u need to update your cios
atleave rev19
then it wont tell u to format
rev19 for the wad file ?
of ios 249
i got ios249
http://www.sendspace.com/file/3xxibi
not rev19 u dont
if the usb laoder is telling u to format
your outdated
ok thx but if i used that will i be apple to play GC backups and wii ?
this has nothing to do with gc
LOL "be apple"
because GC back up luncher has a mios patcher as i belive
this has nothing to do with gc
ok
there's no decent way to boot gc backups from usb.
isn't there any newer cios ?
USB Loader can't do GC games. yet :P
i know that
what is cios anyway ? it isn't like the frimweare ver ?
http://www.sendspace.com/file/3xxibi
ok god dammnit it i will dl it
http://wiibrew.org/IOS
how do you run GC backups on the wii?
i use backup luncher for GC
dvd-rs?
you have to use GC controller
yeah
dvd-r, gc controller and a gc memory card
i was hoping to place them all on a usb :)
dvd-r and you can use multigames in one dvd
the launcher is installed directly into mios
oh ok
only wode can run GC off usb
so it can be used with *corp
you can put 3to5 games on a dvd
That's it?
whats wode?
i'm not doing that, i'll probably waste more discs trying to get all the games to work
http://google.com
cmios has nothing to do with cioscorps
http://www.wodejukebox.com/
ok Shadow cmios is difrent than cios ?
yes
XD
obviously
how so ?
...
i am sorry i am new
...
no need ot loghe
mios is for gamecube, cios is for wii
ok
but my cios is 249
What does the M stand for in MIOS?
good question]
shadow 249 is out of date ?
...

Fail sentance. I only have a GC controller. No classic controller.

I don't like them.
SNES games are great with them...
You don't see the problem, it hangs. It would tell me to insert it.
All PAL channels fail.

been deployed and just got back, anything new i should know about the wii? I know not to take update. But does everything still work or do i need to do something else to wii, does Super Mario Galaxy 2 work and usb too
http://images.4chan.org/v/src/1278332733867.gif
lol
of course
update to latest cfgloader and you should be fine...also install ciosx rev19 if you haven't
thanks did not know new ciosx was out
? list
just put my 2tb ntfs formatted drive onto cfgloader and keeps getting error trying to find wbfs partition....
what am i doing wrong :) ?
plugging it in to the wrong port? :þ
? softmod
where is good place to get rev 19
i have the \wbfs\ folder (as to installed by wbfs manager)
thanks
i believe so , although i am grabbing it again now, just incase
hence why i had the link handy lol
and why ntfs?
fat32 > * for wii
ntfs is better filesystem in my opnion, however wish i did do fat32 now :)
it'll get sorted soon enough though, i have full faith in me and advice from ppl :)
I hope you didn't dedicate the whole 2tb to wii
yup
712 games installed
then I'd definately go with fat32
I assume you converted .iso to .wbfs
i've loaded it up now.. took nearly 28 hours...
yes of course :)
transfered with wii backup manager?
yup
so you have a wbfs folder and inside there each game has it's own folder...and in each folder is a .wbfs file...correct?
...
you're doing everything to make him look like an idiot.
just checking...geezus
i guess that's a way of troubleshooting
yup all in
i am gonna doouble check i have cios19
using a forwarder for cfgloader?
yes
brb fone
i gtg , daughter ill in school
/me gone
? softmod
Hullooo
can you guys recommend a place to order wii wode?
i got mine from www.ps2tune.com
thnx
www.gamefreax.com also has wodes
?
i think it is a chance to order other accessories also...
i bought the black one, did not open it yet...
ps3 wode would be nice ;)
im still waiting for a ps3 hack...
:)
lol, the stand of the wode is white?
/me runs around in circles!
WHY would you want a wode?
for GC isos...
thats the only reason
yea wode is white
i'll never spend as much money on discs as i would on a wode (or a hdd)
o
honestly, the main problem is that my system dvd seems d3-2
but it seems the wode still will not be able to read backups
just isos
the honly solution could be replacing the dvd itself
here you can see my wii/wode setup: http://img822.imageshack.us/img822/6511/cimg0001.jpg
wow, nice
:)
this spyro isn't running on wii, is it?
yea its spyro a heroes tail GC version
works smoothly with wode
ah
hm
hmmm! whats the black controller?
looks like spyro 1 first world.
ccpro
i have one
better than original GC?
nope.
:/
but priceless for mh3
mh3?
thats the classic pro controller
yes
cproc? o_O
a wode for just gc isos...talk about a waste...gc games are SO old...you can BUY them for next to nothing
but they are not available
it is much easier to keep them all in iso format
did everyone forget dvdrs still exist? :/
the alu case is a 1.5TB drive
ill sell a modded cube to someone
viper gc chip
or gx
w/e it is
modded cube...lol...just burn 'em...geez
i do have a GC with viper
u realize dvdr's are still the cheapest way to backup up data if u look at cost per gig
did not update the FW, still 1st release
unlike everyone else
so swap out the wii dvdrom
i bought a used wii
cheaper than a wode
ok
so it was a loterry
6meow
lol
but still the idea of reading isos is not bad
lottery*
which i won :3
no, i did not know
:)
it won't run as fast
this will make a difference now
and you know this how?
14Ohai
the disc one already has compatibility problems.
14Ohai
and?
6meow
hiii
why use a wode instead of a homebrew usb loader?
14meow to you too
oh, nevermind
sure they are...never heard of ebay/craigslist?
so you're in some bumbfuck country that doesn't even have ebay...
the temps here reached 51C the other day :)
lool
:3
the country is not that bad, but no ebay here :)
Makes me 100 times cuter instantly

hello, does anyone know how to remove the SCAM screen from the Homebre Channel 1.0.6? I've got it installed but when I load it from System Menu it shows the scam-screen for about 1 minute before allowing to press button [1]
this OC mario allstars doesn't have an operations guide
0C does most of the injections...you probably got one from a different group
yeah, or maybe no group
anyway, both versions are cool, thanks guys

Why pay $9 for something that is free elsewhere
3why are you sad zuzu

i wouldnt use netflix @ 480p
3well your name is sadzuzu
what do you mean free elsewhere?
paying for netflix in any form is ridiculous
libraries
yeah no shit, you can get fucking brand new games for free at libraries
it's ridiculous
yet people still don't go cause books R gay
ohh, you can check out wii games at the library?
didnt know that
lol
Music as well
No need to pay for a service that should be free in the first place..
well, with the outbreak of the internet, i forgot all about the library
I can see paying for videos but TV shows and what not - TJFR
what duz tjfr mean

oops. sorry about that.
Hey Aurora, I"ve been watching soul eater recently, got till episode 10.it's awesome
good, only 42 more to go
is the app in the correct place on the sd card?
yup. :D
Are you reading it at the same time?
D:
eh? reading? whaddaya mean?
Reading the manga
lol
nah. I don't really read mangas
reading the manga and watching the show would probably kill your brain
oh, I see.
how many manga chapters are there anyway?
brother, it's still going
I'm not sure anymore
:|
76 and going
/me gives Aurora a Death The Kid
the anime has a completely different storyline after episode 25-ish
I'm waiting for it to update XD
if i want to burn a wbfs file so i canplay on a older wii is tht possible?
I would suspect
lol
I still haven't read it
I wonder if it'll pass FMA with 110 chapters
I'm too attuned to the anime story to be interested in the manga story D:
XD
why do people join the channel when they're going to be banne anyway?
hi
same here Aurora but with FMA:B
banned*
or simply because the anime is almost over
you have to convert back to iso
yeah.Aurora is too addicted to Soul. "gives her a Soul"
yep till on 63
/me explodes
the only villain that seems to be good is Medusa
hi hi :)
04Hi
hai quil :)
lol. Death the kid is now officially my fav character in soul eater. I find his obsession with symmtery funny :D
whats up?
nothing special
just started a game - wanna play some after that? :)
sure, it'll give me a little time to wake up <.>
okay i just want to make sure that it is possible
whuts that OMG for? :P
haha
use wii backup manager to convert wbfs back to iso
i use backup manager i dont think u do thoug wlugar
if only because of the arvarice
i finally picked my next champion: pantheon :P
lol,why Brother?
D:
oh okay cool
sorry, but Medusa is the most awesome villain ever
will be much easier to win with that one, when i finally can play him right
but.. he's ANNOYING
of course I use wii backup manager
Because, he's Greed as the xingese prince XD
even though she has some weird motives in the anime
but nidalee is more of a supporter then a gamewinner :P
jepp
Aurora: Father can beat her :P
i thought u used wbfs something
and i plan to be more annoying that you ever saw him yet :P
ah :)
it auto scrubs them so i didnt know if that messed it up if i wanted to burn it
cause it started out as a 4.7gb iso
Medusa is just plain creepy...
if only he literally becomes God at episode 61
which was the most epic moment in the series
*then
<.>
and watch what wii backup manager makes it ;)
Brother becoming God was the most epic moment in the series
"is shot" XD
then that would mean I killed 50 million people o.o
id ont need to do it right now but its good to know that
because on my external i have all the iso's still
XD. just kidding
:p
iso's and wbfs files of the same game
blah. gotta go. needs sleep.later guys! :D
seeya

IMAGINATION
IS THE BEST
:D
Indeed!
the thing that woke me up was kind of unpleasant >.>
:(
/me huggles!
Mplayer ce plays iso?
/me hugs
doubt it - it might do, though
presumably that's an ISO of a DVD
yeah
what wokes you up?
/me hugs ^^
/me huggles
well, there's only one way to find out
try it and see
omg.. the piece of bacon i was eatting just fell in my parfait.. which has whipped topping on the top which is where the bacon landed and it still tasted so yummy when i ate it!
Well, obviously.
It IS bacon.
flowers make the best gift to a loved one apparently even if they do die eventually and wilt and start to stink and rot
Bacon is good with anything.
*nods*
Does Mplayer need any cIOS?
not afaik
but please read the !rules, you're a bit tentative...
for USB2.0 I think it might, not sure though
go with chocolate
it makes everyone better
2 Aurora 36410 "after like 6, he told me they were dog biscuits" <-- you ate dog biscuits?
chocolate yum
Oh I forgot, mplayer isn't allowed here >>
yeah, I believe that's what IOS202 is for
um
no
mplayer is fine
lol yeah i DID
So worried against breaking rules
cIOS isn't allowed here sometimes, depending on its use
caps dfjknkdgr
lol
it's cIOS that's the issue
in any case, it will still be playable (if very slow/stuttery) with USB1.1, so you'll be able to find out without it
we try to avoid it in most cases
but for MPlayer on 202, you're fine
smae problem
I blame Vista
if it plays but very slowly, you'll need to find a way of enabling USB2.0. If it doesn't play at all, it won't work whether you have it or not, so don't bother.
Isn't HBC in the first place breaking the rules anyway? why worry about piracy if you already broke rules?
lol
um
in what way is HBC "breaking the rules"?
were they good? because I've tried dry dog kibble and it tastes dry
there's no flavor
Dosnt it go against some TOS or something like that?
IF its legit, why does nintendo try so hard to break it?
anyone know how to get and put boxart for the games on usbloader w/o having to download them manually through the usbloader?
It's not legit, but it's also not illegal (in most countries)
I'm pretty certain it's legal in the country in which this channel was founded (UK), so that's all that matters
that shit takes so long, was wondering if i could just download them and toss em on the sd card
:o what now
legit = Nintendo like it, in this case
Hiya!
hbc is too legit
hi Obsi
yes
Nintendo don't like it
i wonder why everyone keeps thinking that hbc is illigal.
/me hugs Obsi & May
wb Kipi
nintendo doesn't like lots of things :)
lol
Hullo, Oreo.
/me ish hugged and huggles back
:O Oreo
TBH, I'm not sure whether it's legal in the US or not, DMCA and all that
/me hugs Kipi
Oreo?
tis what Kipi calls me
lol
isn't there something against reverse-engineering or something?
pretty sure it is legal in US
because I love oreos
yes
TOS is pretty much a warrenty
in order to break piracy, yes
which has been broken by installing it
glad I don't live there then, lol :P
but i don't think hbc has that intention :)
/me gives you a basket full
/me snuggles May
mAY
*May
ya
the dog biscuits I ate were basically chocolate chip cookies
I didn't realize i was eating biscuits until I was told
...dog biscuits with chocolate?
that's kind of odd
well, it wasn't chocolate
obviously
but it tasted like it
that's really weird
I didn't think that was possible to imitate chocolate chips
oh look new pokemanz
...
wut?
it'll be quicker letting usb loader download them all for you whilst you research :)

hi Skyalnds
Floof has arrived!
well, in that case you haven't seen too much from the internet til now
i was joking
iv seen stupider
well
that was... rather odd
has xai seen it?
we all have lolololol
yeah
and he thinks it's creepy
geez, I hate overly patriotic people
well
but I don't even know if I can call that patriotic
nationalist
wtf do I call him now o-o
03Hi :3
since when do nationalists need to think rational?
^ really odd
/me pokes Sneas :P
10!sneas
/me now belongs to Skylands for 15 minutes
lol, my aunt loves to make fun of people like this
:3
10!espeon
/me now belongs to Skylands for 10 minutes
03:3!
03And hi xD
que son muy grandes en verdad!
I'm officially scared of this guy
/me cuddles Skylands Espeon :P
10?
the guy's living in Woonsocket
xD
10I am not an Espeon D:
odd place for odd person
She isn't, but I belong to you right now. That's what he meant
I wouldn't complain if you were thou- hi
10:O
dunno if I shall approve him. Need to talk to Arti first
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxWskedKAVU :3
does Arti even know this guy personally? owo
You're fine just as you are, shush.
nope
that's what makes everything kinda creepy
wow, now that love at first sight I guess
10Breefloof > Espfloof
There's not really much floof on Espeons
apart from the cheeks, but we know this already
10which is why my above statement holds thruth
10truth*
03TKfloof
/me runs
10No.
am I a bit too harsh?^^
03also
/me tries jailbreaking his extra iPod Touch
nope
that's stolen art
I was just surprised by the size of it
03holy crap sweet
03It worked
LOOOOOOL
ok
c

o.o
/me stays to floofthings
!umbreons
just read it
03oh
03oops :3
the blur and size semi-gives it away on its own
03Did the wrong one
Arrow: You need to lean in this direction when the bus turns that way. Remember what I said about centre of gravity?
and the idea about combining my new zippo with zippo lighting fuel and a stars&stripes + a fake Ho-oh-plush is getting more and more attractive....
6wtf arrow lol
o-O
O_o
random pop in and out
do you think he'll like if I'll set his avatar on the forum to this? http://www.n24.de/media/_fotos/1politik/2008_2/mrz_2/080320/bgproteste/17.jpg ^^
or that? http://static.rp-online.de/layout/showbilder/11854-ap-101050_WILLIAMS_EXECUTION_CAJC113.jpg
Use tinyurl.com
too lame to copy&paste?^^
LOL
Where would I paste it?
it's rude, but the second made me laugh the most
I can't drag something out of my DS to an invisible computer
some fires are fought the best with fire :P
6fine do it
6it'll probably just add to the fire with other nationalists in our site
6and then those who hate the us
6and well, we wind up in yet another arguement
6shall we go into the BLEURGHERURGHGH
I say do it, but only cuz that's not what Roara wants.
'w'
6I couldn't care less about the war, but I'm saying that because it's my job
im sad
wow....a world war due to a burning piece of cloth. I'm impressed
6I personally don't respect it
wasted 2 days to watch this show
n it has a sucky ending
:@
6...
6well, the cloth is one thing
6changing his avatar to fit your personal amusement is actually sick
6considering the picture's topic
it's not sick, that's what you call sarcasm or black humor :)
6...
huh, I like my OCs ^w^
6this isn't the first I've wondered this question, to be completely honest
because I enjoy to help the community, know quite well about the tech-stuff and am very dedicated to Lugia
6ok
6so changing that avatar to something like that is helping the community?
6quite a different definition, if you ask me
guys..
6what
looks like I met a dark spot of yours :P
not the right place?
just
no
:3
6looks like i've met a dark spot of yours
>w>;
AFK
playing LoL
6stupidest line I've heard
6but whatever
not really, because I'm smiling about how ffffffffffffffff you go because of a mentioned idea of mine regarding a piece of cloth
even less: A picture of a piece of cloth
6actually you know what
6I'll respect the other people in this chat
-rolls eyes-
hello
6I'm not doing this
Really, there is no reason for this to be done in a "public" setting like in this channel tbh
/me must actually go real soon just because she wants to work on the devolpment of her oc's
...well
loplwut
10Can people not get along anymore :/
it IS insulting, but what do you think Arti would think? she wants the site to remain peaceful
we don't want a fight over a flag and someone being a nationalist
/me facepaws
/me belches
well, that's the kind of answer I waited for tbh
I mean hell I sure dislike overly patriotic people along with overly religious people but that doesn't mean it would be right to godmod their avatar or something. But tl;dr obsolete discussion is obsolete
in my opinion
anyway
possible new pokemon, news on serebii
just restating what I said earlier
great, more reasons to facepalm
/me hides
xD
I just dislike the green broccoli head
10The green unconfirmed thing is ugly
/me nods
therefore if I catch one, I will name it Broccoli
10I think the brown one is the pre-evolution of Ononokusu
I just hope they for once pre-release uncovers all the bad ones. I mean all generations has bad Pokeymans so I just hope...
and yay for more werepokemon
10May, have you seen the other green bear thing?
:3
ew
I hate it
10I think the unconfirmed green one might be realted to it, dontcha think?
10related*
maybe
but we just have to wait and then seen how wrong we are or how right we could've been?
X3
That's a lot of joining and quitting.

Should have properly closed the connection.
That's how it's done.
lol I totally didn't expect THAT
Expect the unexpected
...LOL
/me points to his quit message.
Oh, that is an idea!
it would be much better with more smug though
really, right there it would even fit
XD
i feel like this guy won the internet arguement when he told me to climb a wall of dicks. there's no comeback that tops that

I don't mind any of them more than the others

/me rolls in

You guys know what I love? When I almost post a link in the totally wrong channel but notices it before it's too late.
Yeah.
/me flies off of it and goes into orbit
Ew
And how are you winning?
It was probably porn from WC
/me flees!
I'd love to play a file of Francis saying "nnnnnope" right now because you sir Kipi are wrong.
/me reaches up to catch Curly!

That's what she said

Espeon said a joke and I stated he said it.

Whoa
Whoa, bro.
Bro... don't do it

/me hideflailwiggles
Foooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...*huff-puff* Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood!!!
/me gives kipi good
brb
*food
Almost gave him money
Money is food
only if you like paper
No
in a way money is food. but only in a way
I'm an herbivore, and money is the root of all evil.
So kipi
is the tree of all evil
o3o
Espeon: depends on the situation but dont make me use my brain
Brother your logic is irrefutable
Therefore, money, as roots, is edible as a plant to herbivors
Espeon: if only for a day
Brother, that's dumb.
I eat the roots.
I'm not the tree
Why would you say something so silly?
so you're the roots?
o3o
no Espeon he eats evil
therefore he is
Yush.
do any games besides sports resort support wiimotion plus ?
So we do what reasonable people do

You'd be stooping to my level to become the exact thing I was

03I'm playing Pokemon Crystal on my iPod
Yeah.
It really is becoming great.
And I prefer apt-get myself.
I just use aptitude
/me was hoping to tackle a hug onto it >:/
(Used to prefer apt-get)
/me is bored.
Then again, it's going to start selling software soon
that's nothin
really?
i've been playing pkmn glod on my 2004 pda for awhile
;p
Mhm, I think that's a good thing though.
gold*
i sometimes use apt-get
hiiiiiii
If people want to sell their software, they should be able to.
I use aptitude (commandline only, no gui, not even curses)/yum
/me sighs
14And I've been playing Pokemon Red on my mobile phone so :P
And providing them the means to do it is good.
ohai
aptitude is curses :P
03XD
yeah :P
03Now to find a GBA emulator that is free
there are plenty
but it annoys me because it's just raw packages
03Only one I see is $4.99
Hai, Miyuki :o
no
i see them as free
03(for ipod touch)
i like the software center cause i can install full apps and stuff
even if you have to pay
hi..
03?
well think of it this way
How is the Miyuki? :o
you can't sell something that is similar to something copyrighted
legally
so
03It says Purchase $4.99
03o.o
why not just grab a cracked version of one of those
for free
Ah, then I see a reason for not using it :P
since it's really illegal either way
one way you just pay
03dunno how XD
one sec
it depends on what i'm installing whether i'll use software center or apt-get
03Kinda the only one I see
U BE BETTER OFF
oops caps
03Only one I see is gpSPhone
u dont need it
u can deal without it man
depressed
not now
i am sometimes
when i get a new graphics card for my desktop, i'm gonna install 10.04 and win7
Not much
at all
my main lappy (this one) is osx
just listening to various music, got back from the movies
03hmm

Hey Miyuki :)
Keep the WM+ for Zelda.

nah
http://www.iphone-hacks.com/iphone-downloads/file/72

/me hugtackles it!
thanks :o
or the gba emu for psp
/me huggles
i'm doing it for steam
Miyuki: I dunno D: I rarely pay attention to how I am.
hang on a moment
steam is coming to linux
I'm too fast
the problem is i have to wait for them to port the games
Doesn't have great Mac support yet :P
03How do I install it?
nope
that's why i'm putting on win7
and i'm upgrading the drive so i'll just install 7 on the old one
You have a Wii!
i odn't own a i-anything
so idk

the fire works seemed alright on my side
And cba to open youtube.
aww
though the only good music was "what a wonderful world"
I never buy any
I just go to other places where they're being shot off
it kinda supprises me cause i'm a bit ofa pyro
had to work anyway
Aurora.
Everything encrypted with js

I would've
And decrypted

Cool.
Implemented well

12the TST meet BBQ was the best!
i'm starting to get sick of the same old routine
ah, yeah same here

sometimes in life you need to change it up some
before it gets old
12omg brother has joined the IRA!
12you terrorist!
yeah but thats still life
yep
XD
sorta bored at the moment
IRA,IRSP
i love em all
got stuck on rachet and clank and stopped playing it
have no idea where to go
Oh, you finally got it
lol
you've been talking about it for a while, I hadn't realized you bought it
my art skill has plummeted so i either got to wait for my mojo to come back or draw a bunch of crap til i get better
I couldn't help you, I don't have a PS3
yeah well i just want to burn my games and play them
ive had it for over a week
not put them on a flash drive
yeah, for me my art is held back by motivation
who said flash drive?
Arti, did you notice who registered today?
i'm almost at the end but i cant find out where to go
I'll feel motivated one day, then for an entire week I won't anymore
you're using a flash drive?
thats even funnier
is it possible to downgrade a wii from 4.3 to 4.2?
12Yes I did
well my external drive is not fat32 and has a bunch of stuff on it so i dont want to use that either
you could always look up a strategy guide :P
i've looked up on game faqs and i just get a bunch of answers not relating to my question
Hmm
unless i read the walk throough which i dont
*want to
Is it possible to install hbc for firmware 4.3 yet?
no, u are on a channel that has ppl with common sense
any comments?^^
wtf would try and use a flash drive?
yeah, the walkthrough would be the most helpful but that takes away from the experience
no
then theres crap that happens in the house... oi...
why?
ah, family issues...
he never said he want to use a flash drive
those can be fun...
i had to deal with a roto rooter the other day
i want to burn my games and im sure others do to
Is it possible to stay at 4.2 and still use the wii shop?
no just house work
what's a roto rooter?
oh yeah, that's also fun :P
"LOL"?
that sorta tipped me off
12hnmm
no ive been trying it to do so
its a long thick wire that has sort of a fork at the end that spins and its ment for the drain under your house to eat up the roots cloging the drain
12eep
ah I see
12i'm not a chair
you feed it up under the house and it eats up the roots cloging the drain
I don't think we've got one of those
Your nose is
then u have a new wii that cant read burned discs most likely
12heh
:O
True.
But not quite as comfy
anyway the dam thing was tangled in its bundle and i had to manage feeding it and untangling it for 2 hours
u will either have to usa a usbhdd or a usbdvd drive
no its the old origional wii for sure
did he even try and mod it yet?
and i managed to get blisters all over my hands even though i was wearing gloves
did you have to go under the house to do it?
yeah its modded
softmod?
ive been trying to get it to work for days
yeah
nah the drain was in front of the front yard
had to go through that way
u modded it urself ?
its softmodded and yes i did it myself
Where's TST Bot? :<
ah
what fw version did it have ?
originally
"Ha! I'll turn you inside out, since I have not done that to anyone for a very long time!" *SKLURCH* "Oh, yes. That's why. Sorry about your clothes."
supid o.o
uhhh not sure it was never upgraded until i got it

Floof has arrived!
10Grr

/me meeps back at Kipi
14RA
silly internuts

we joked around that we became so good at being lazy that management is telling us to now
*** sonic_1 (rick@highlife.net) has joined channel #perl

Yeah, they do that to our In-Stock guys all the time
I've overheard a lot of them complaining
whats the serial no of ur wii?
they could at least pull someone from the other side and put them there
yeah
Took me ages to realise wtf was wrong, until I realised my brain was blanking the top line :P
grocery is where a lot of walmart's profit comes from
I was just gonna say
Oh, wait
it's the grocery people that they always do it to
no
There's more than just that *sigh*
yes
it took me a while to notice the 'fi'
are you usually in grocery?
first i was just thinking 'shell script'
lol
rofl
rofl
Yeah, same.
every line is wrong :P
yes
shadowmofo, some wiis and also some 360s are very picky, my 360 will only eat emtec and verbatim, all else u get dirty disc error. my friends 360 eats all fine
probably the side with the least stolen murchendise as well suppriseingly enough
every. Single. Lin.
lol
tab? :P
bbl, making dinner
Wait, was that a joke
I CAN'T EVEN TELL ANYMORE
a lot of people steal from our walmart and hide the packaging in the bathroom garbage
:D
surprisingly it tends to be in the womens' bathrooms
!seen shadowmofo
ill see dvd covers empty pill bottles and all sorts of wrappers in the ailes but i only see a few boxes of twinkies or crackers or whatnot
[05:18:37pm] <7/5/2010> -bag-gfiso- shadowmofo has not been seen by me.
[05:18:38pm] <7/5/2010> -Zag71- shadowmofo has not been seen by me.
yeah
noone here by that nick
same here
well i see him, thats enuff for me
whats the serial got to do with it. i would have to go look

13on what?
:3
lol yeah

Aurora: you should watch a movie
ello Sky
at least you have an excuse to waste the day then :p
even worse
Starting InspIRCd...
Failed: Config file error
Could not display log file: Could not find file 'C:\Program Files\InspIRCd\bin\ircd.log'.
hell people do it with movies too anymore
yeah, true
anything that's digital really
my brother pirated how to train a dragon a month ago
13go to the public pool
:O
Maybe you can make the file ircd.log :3
Then it can find it \o/
That's a good movie too
10lol
yeah
i'm supprised cause its fairly new as well
maybe watch the disney classics aurora?
i did
no wonder, I've just activated his account about two hours ago :P
13PONYO!
and he didn't login or try to since then
http://i50.tinypic.com/30c90zc.jpg I am proud
I've seen a lot of this year's movies and the best ones were HTTYD and Toy Story 3
12Oh lol
i havent seen toy story
I very nearly teared up a bit
i dont watch too many movies anymore
/me shrugs t
13oh hey Arti
~.~ must go now, is in trouble
i only watched httyd cause the night fury intrigued me
meh
We all <3 you Sky, that's why :3
wish SMF had a function like the FAF do. Admins and Mods can give users warning points there. If a user has too many of them, all his postings require moderation - saying a Mod needs to read over the comments BEFORE they're either activated or deleted
the night fury was awesome
the only movie that stands out in my mind that i really liked was the dark knight
lol warn system
6...why are we talking like he's already cause a lot of trouble on the site
10:P
6*caused
13who?
yeah, it was pretty good
Espeon: that reminds me of the reputation system
just throwing in ideas. Not that any of those things was required until now...except for one or two incidents in almost five years
it's true
yet still I'm a feature-lover :)
but there were several others that i wanted to see but never really got up to see them
Aww
speaking of which... another movie rental place is going out of business here in town
13and now our feature presentation
and, like most here, a bit random :P
Yeah, InspIRCd has some problems
Maybe you could give it a hug and then it would work!
oh really?
lol rep system
i'm supprised cause it was the only competition to block buster
13X3
10:3
I believe SMF does have something like that. It's called "Karma"-system
Family Video is the best
hi guys
i have CFG
arg...this reminds me of revleft now >>
I've seen that on quite a few sites. Silly name for it though
and i'm affraid of going ot block buster cause i was late due to a snow storm in giveing back banjo tooie
12*yawn*
but i also wanted to know what GX loader would be like
lol
and i dont know if they kept tabs on it or not
13OO
12Curious
13Hi Lucario
14Der be a Lucario
i doubt it but i still dont go there
does my drive HAVE to be WBFS for GX loader to see it?
/me builds a very dangerous fountain out of sausages, while running naked in the woods while trying to claw at the moon.
and Roara btw.: It's about the same like the airbags in my car. I'm happy and feeling good they're there yet I hope I'll never see what's inside those labeled pieces of plastic
o3o
use cfg
/me tugs Skylandstail :3c
even if they did they wouldn't charge you extra for later rentals I'm sure
/me then poofs
6fine
and u can use fat32 or ntfs
13X3
i prefer fat32 as do most
im using fat32
i sorta wanted to try out netflix or gametap sometime though
o.o
They're both nice
I've had both
"The best battle is the battle that doesn't need to be fought" - that's a chinese saying
I say, we plant bait
redbox is nice too
i dont even think i have cIOS 222
ive seen redboxes around too
Oh whoops
I was scrolled up
they only charge you a dollar a day?
13what kind of bait
FUCK FX
Nevermind then. :O
something like that
use cfg
Aw man.
an old one at tat
/me gnaws on a death ray.
*that
i am using it.
GX*

there's no due date\
LOL
CFG

i see
13So a Chick walk into KFC < end

there was a point?
i mean how does it know that you have returned it
your extremely good at wii stuff
Ah
but your a dick.
xD
It's all online
The daddler takes the dark for the deep,
the wild for the powerful,
the undefined for the infinite,
the senseless for the supernatural.
the kiosks are connected to the internets
you're*
sorry
:P
6...
you can reserve a copy of a movie from home and go pick it up even
do you scan it before putting it in the slot or something?
you're*
so can anyone help me with USB loader GX?

13wow

do you by any chance live in a house with little to no air conditioning?
it sucks this time of year
nope
i would bet
we have AC
infact i got a cold the other week cause my dad left the ac on and i had no covers on
but my mom's picky about the electric bill so we have to keep it at a certain temperature
and for some reason my room is either the hottest or coldest in the house
which happens to not be a very cold temperature
mine is always too
13hey Skyland
lol my dad is complaining about the water bill
I think it's because the only vent in my room is sourrounded by stuff
/me punches her computer

from what my brother said, its a job finding someone who'll speak english to you
Hello
And welcome to Walmart!
how may i take your order
fire the current management and replace them with people who know what they're doing
i'm feeling like arbies
kthx
ha
what is waninkokos cIOS?
i wonder why the hell they went to the system where they increased management
2 people sitting on their ass doesn't seem to make up for just the one
Hm
Well
Other than being annoyed at Walmart management for making me repeat tasks and then undo them
The roof was leaking today
:O
At Walmart?
Silly modem-
yeah
Actually shut itself down.
and they couldn't do anything about it because construction has the day off
I sure hope someone put a bucket out there
:P
Oh
air conditinoing unit and pipes tend to leak around here but they dont do a thing to them
So they just put buckets under it
Our Walmart has a leaky roof and all we do is the buckets as well
I know where all the leaky spots are too because it was my job to put the buckets there
well at least your walmart wasnt notorious for having birds in it
ours had a bat recently
brb, time to eat
i think mine was on the news once to try to take a shot at it for having bird waste around a long time ago
XD
would have shut the store down too but they addressed it pretty quickly
Oh yeah
it was fun
you buy the best of the fireworks and lit the town of fire
*on
Nah, we just watched
:P
wish i could buy one of those big ass ones
i think there was one called big ass as well
but i didnt get to do much as i worked
Haha
big ass fireworks
anyway
how was your 4th?
it had the scent of a used diaper
o.O
sounds fun
i found a used diaper last night in my aile
oh, you had to work?
yep
:(
so did my brother
he work now?
yeah, he works at Culvers
never heard of it
it's a fast food place
he takes orders and cleans tables
shadow u can cook?
w/o blowing shit up?
yeah
course you already kno
and potentially two other jobs
o.o
lol
yeap
That's what I get for not using tab.
i still dont
I gotta redo everyone's nick colors now
everyone has the full hostmasks now
/me shot the moon.
awesome
Yawn, easy.
now you got to skinn it debone it butcher it and cook it
I was refering to hearts by the way. :P
lol
i know
actually first thing i thought of was a yoyo trick
Ok, didn't know if you knew. XD
haha
if GX loader asks me to format a WBFS partition...
and i click format
will that completely format my harddrive
or just an unused part?
man i wish you guys knew how to play eucher
all of it
hmm
is there anyway of getting GX loader to use FAT32
instead of WBFS?
no not that i know
of
gx is tarted
its my fav card game along with spoons or bull or w/e
go dl/ cfg :)
i have CFG
save ur self some times
but spoons is only fun if your getting your ass kicked
alread
already*
then y in god name would u use gx?
lmao
because i like the GUI
hah reskin cfg
hmm
they have 3989083890 themes
to quiet
i dont like CFG's font.
its like 16 bit.
it there anyway to partition my harddrive without completely formatting it?
lol my brother is cussing people out in wow and i can hear him in the other room
Lol, I dunno any of those. The ones I play are usually one of: Slam, shit head, poker (texas hold 'em), hearts, or trumps.
/me yips.
/me yaps!
/me YOWLS!!!
trumps?
yes
how?
wtf is shit head lol
wbfs manager?
or something like that?
i think the new one has it
Just card games. XD
the new what?
trumps makes me think eucher
wbfs manger
its called Wii Backup Manager?
no thats wii backup manger
thou i think that does it 2
hmm
okay
ill look into them
thanks alot
xD
ha
i think he hates me
nope
he hates n00bs
if u happen to b a n00b then yea
Trumps is where all the cards are dealt out between the players, ace is high, one player chooses the trump suit, which wins over other suits. Goal is to win as many hands as possible, you must play the same suit as the first card played in a hand, if you can, if not you can play whatever you want, if you play a the highest trump card in the hand, you win.
he hates u
but its not personall
its just he doesnt like u :) haha
so yeah basically eucher
I dunno what eucher is, must be a different name for the same game.
Oh, and you can play in teams if you want.
back
Shit head is kind of like uno.
Some numbers do certain things.
only eucher cuts the deck in half 9-A and its rank is strait up except for the trump in which the jacks of the same color are the highest trump
ah
Well, each person starts with 7 cards, and three face down cards, with three face up cards on top of them.
lol, the only card games I can play are go fish and uno
haha
Oh, I like go fish.
im deffinately a n00b
i never played uno
eucher is fun though
hehe
me 2
dont feel bad
so is spoons when you got a good crowd going on
every1 cant b a expert
You have to play a card the same as, or higher than the previous card (unless circumstances brought about by special cards change it).
that way you can litterally get your ass kicked
some people have more time to devote to it then others
Oh, I forgot cheat as well.
haha
im more of a user
and not at all
Lol
a developer
Not really
:P
its not due to time its due to users knowing how to use a search engine
ah
not at all
i was storta getting that vib a little
Her parents are but she is not
her parents are nazis!
baq
lol
:O
Never heard of Culver's!?
nope
Nor have I, but I live in the UK.
I can fully understand why Shadow states the statements he does here!.. Theres one thing to help users however everyone needs to do some research on there own..
I think it's a midwest chain
lol, I'm not surprised that you haven't, for tht very reason
oh, it might be
most of them are in Minnesota and Wisconsin
But then agian what do I know~
I always assumed it was nationwide
but I never had any reason why I assumed that
I remember reading the paper that they put on the trays
http://www.termlifeinsurance.org/15-things-you-should-know-about-weed/
And it listed all their locations
there actually weren't very many
Hm
XD, I just noticed something
There we go
okay
so i got WBFS manager
how do i partition without formatting the drive?
btw im googling it as well
\o/
i like me a mocha
Never had Mocha
wbfs manager FTL... just format the drive to fat32
I'm willing to try it sometime though
whats the difference between a mocha anda capachino
its good
tastes more like chocolate than coffee
the drive is already FAT32
but backing it up
would take hours.
I haven't had cappucino either :P
why do you have to back it up?
i personally hate coffee
i want to partition it as wbfsÃ©fat32
whoops
if it's already fat32, just convert .iso to .wbfs
wbfs/fat32
Hot drinks seem weird to me
im trying to use GXloader
but i drink it to get me in a decent mood
you don't need wbfs
except hot chocolate
i dont think it supports FAT32
use CFGLoader, it's the best usb loader period
i usually get cold "frappe" mochas
i know... i know.
i already use it
tastes better
but i wanna see GX loader
but since its so much trouble...
nvm.
are there any other loaders that support FAT 32?
Wiiflow?
or what you could just do is get a cup of coffee and some chocolate milk and mix it together and it taste pretty good
GX is for people with kids that want to just point at a game and press A, which can also be done with CFG
i do that at walmart if i need a boost as they have coffee in the break room
yeah
and if a need a desperate boost ill mix it with mountain dew
Ugh
isn't that disgusting?
actually its pretty good
sounds gross
mt dew over powers the coffee
i am a kid D:
xD
not really.
but i really like GUI
i fear i may become addicted to caffeen
okay you know what
lol
here is a better question
is there anyway to change CFG loaders font?
of course
lol don't worry
*dew
for i walketh into a shadow in which i may never come back from
how o_o
i hate the font.
I don't drink anything with carbonation
its so..
pixelated
i use to not to unless i was desperate
now i dont mind it much
lol, shoulda seen her try my jelly belly soda
i still hate coke
I can't drink it
/me looks leerily for rdx
I hate how the carbonation feels
I didn't even notice the carbonation XD
jelly belly soda?
and stops after the first sip
yeah, it wasn't very good
but it wasn't very bad either
jelly belly as in jelly bean?
yep
your such a mess
but i still love u
i hate jelly beans
my parents bought it so I'd have something to drink there
It was them who bought it then?
not realizing that since it said "soda," it would be carbonated
lol
haha
I'm pretty sure it was
i think food makes you so much more loving
at least there was that bottled water there
or did someone drug you
haha
that was some nice and refreshing water if I do say so myself
:P
XD yeah
if that even
Woo, got HBC and the rest back on my 4.3 :)

7What's the name of the exact guy who writes the soundtrack for media?
music/sound director? soundtrack composer?
there's all sorts of names for the job
http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=1746
hi/wb
I'm impressed. It's well-known the electric system of New York City is rotten, old and can't stand the demands, but despite it regularly fails, they still didn't do anything about it...
anybody here used darkcorp?
instead of cioscorp?
:-)
07...
I mean - they fight wars all over the world, they dream about colonizing the moon and the mars, they fly into orbit, but they can't supply their towns with the electricity required?
show me something that's more of a fail :P
never heard of it, then agn I havent booted my wii up in awhile
2hm
replacing infrastructure sounds expensive
07well duh o3o
2politicians dont do crap until something happens, and when they do, its because whatever they pass lines their pockets
it is if you're stupid enough to only have a single route to every destination so you've got to intentionally take the whole thing down for an upgrade
well then there's your answer
o-o
compare with the UK national grid, which has several routes to most locations, and so large swathes of supply lines can be taken down for long replacement periods without interrupting the flow of power
well, maybe that's the reason why ALL power lines in europe are redundant. Two out of three can fail without a city blacking out :P
2lol
2yup
well, what about installing backup wires then? That's possible and new wires are needed anyways
All, is it possible to downgrade IOS41?
after the new wires are removed, just cut the old one's and replace them by the new one's
2they cant get anything done
yeah, they prefer "popular" topics over common sense
do politicians have control over that sort of thing? I'd have assumed engineers and city planners would have make most of the decisions...
right now it's cheaper to overpay workers to maintain live wires than to replace the old ones, even if it's more expensive in the long run
I have V3348 :(
and politicians don't have direct control, but they do control all the budgeting, so if they don't assign enough money to the electrics, nothing can be done to improve them
2trust me, its full of beurocratic BS
just wait until our robot overlords arrive
then it'll be fine
2lol
hello?
i softmodded my wii and sometimes it plays the game and most time i get error 1167 and help

7Hello? o3o
Guys I have the wrong IOS 41 on my wii. I v3348 and need the older version. Can I downgrade it?

? usbloader
? wbfsmanager
so i did install a usb loader, and something else that handles dvds...what else do you guys recommend?!

someone called blackiethedragon
6kinda funny how they totally missed the difference between luane and your designs
7o3o
7Hey, Rora.
7*late again*
it's even more funny she didn't search DA for this name - as ALL the art I have regarding her has her name as tag...
7Remember your old 'eat a rock' thingymabob?
hi hi

7Uh.
6yes...?

4does any one have a pokemon drawing request?
6why not try some for yourself
6instead of asking everyone else
4ok
/me yawns and stretches :3
know what's even more depressing? Only ONE artist answered to my request regarding a commission. And even that one didn't answer anymore after I sent a note with my contact details...
6hmm
6was your request rediculously specific?
6because that shuts commissioners off
I didn't even say what I wanted. All I was asked for was a contact adress
6who'd you ask?
she's called Electrosa
? list
the first note's about two weeks ago, the second almost a week
4who?
no response this far
6maybe they're young artists who wont be able to do the commission?
I didn't even say WHAT I want
6I mean, they wil literally be unable to do it, whether because of payment or shipping
4???
well Roara, whom would you recommend?
I mean, you're an artist yourself and eventually know more artists than I do :P
07someone else who's art you like that actually responds within 3 days? o3o
07*whose o3o
there's the problem: There are few artists doing Lugia art I like :P
6you could check with braindeadmareep
and two of them are usually here. But none of these two does have free resources
4i do lugia art infact ill do one now ^^
6but if you're looking for lugia-specific artists, I'll have to look around
6I highly doubt HeartGold would be into commissions...
o.o
think you got my worries^^
6what?
4im just doing lugia now

4hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
7By the way, why's your name what it is, Zu?

12LOL
stupid Google
Articuno, hey
<<owns an iPad and is fine with it
think you can fix the server config to allow more than 4(?) Mibbit users at once?
apparently Apple users are so dumb they don't knwo how to use /me
/me runs
im just lazy
/me uses an ipad
I know this might not be the best channel to ask, but, how to get customizemii running on linux?
!apple
10EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW QUICKTIME
!apple
im not used to IRC because i have a life srry
06EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW SCROLL WHEELS
!apple
/me 13uses an ipod
04EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW APPLE IN GENERAL
well you get the idea.
drf
13!apple
03EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW SAFARI
wine ftw?
what
I thought it was renamed to brickmii
or mono
also
another thing iphones can't do
QR codes
can't remember if it's .NET or native
those are fricking awesome
Android has it built in :D
mon
o
how can you say ewwww to a browser that actually uses HTML5
Though I'm positive I have run it in the past
apparently it has mono support
i hate Adobe flash D:
that is, no foolish hooks into the native world
mono it is then
so slow
13I like my iphone
6never realized how often drf hates apple on here
10Wb
(some apps dare to depend on native libs... makes your app non-portable in one flash)
hes a hater
10Chumera
6it really IS all the time
10CHUM
13you see him saying !apple every day
06EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW IPODS
/me 13hides
Yes, mono... but what to do? What to compile?
LOL
:/ at least wrap those functionallity, so it can be replaced..
i resent that remark
He has dreams about destroying apple products.
No I don't
I actually haven't :/
just run the .exe via mono
ubuntu
I did destroy one for real once
fedora
13except the fruit
you do know they oiutlast hardware wise
has mono
i put Windows on my Mac
install mono
^^
run the exe through mono
WUT
???
profit!
:3
wait
/me noms
oh.
that or Ubuntu Linux
you need the winforms packages I think
yeah
I thought of mono as a framework
10om nom nom
kinda fun
you do realize taht doesn't actually matter, right?
install the libmono-winforms2.0-cil package
|3
*that
13Guest
it does
Apple hardware is waaaay inferior to proper hardware
prolly pulls in the mono framework too
13hey Quany
07Hmm, Java.
like you pay 3x the cost
I built my own computer
it'll beat any mac hands down
Quality Hardware + Windows 7 = best gaming machine evar
and it cost less than your typical Mac
not evil version
a *lot* less
07Both Java and my firewall flare up at it.
13I like Windows and Microsoft
and I have an i7
dude, they have a desktop thats $500
Quany, have you ever used CGI:IRC?
13mostly becuase of FSX
i have i7 as well
well, it's BASICALLY just Java
lol
:P
i paid $1300 for my MB Pro
it has a crapslow dual core if that
which is why I said version
no...
07One second, clone coming:
OK, and what are the specs of that?
13Clooone
anyway, not going to defend
also, version can mean "equivalent", in more informal uses
(both are VM's , that's true)
/me 13greets the clone
07Java is a fish.
hey guys
07o3o
also keep in mind
that Mibbit basically took CGI:IRC and made it look fancier
CFGloader, how do you get it to autoload wbfs folder on a fat32 drive
2.53GHz Intel Core i5 processor with 3MB shared L3 cache; or optional 2.66GHz Intel Core i7 processor with 4MB shared L3 cache
13welcome though you soon will not live
instead of always trying to load wbfs1 part
you could call java a version of Oak :3
13because your a clone
How much do you have to pay to get that i7 in there?
like $4000?
nope
13is there a i8
no.
if you previously worked for apple you get to mod it for cheaper
there's an i7 Extreme with 6 cores though
you worked for Apple?
13oh
13no
13don't even have a job
13oooooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
XD
I do
NVIDIA GeForce GT 330M graphics processor with 512MB of GDDR3 memory
I'm at it right now :)
13sorry
/me 13goes back to huging his Lugia
my MSI has a 160M with 1GB DDR3
wow
Thank you, guys
i used to work with apple
I could easily upgrade it to a 260
It just wasn't out at the time
XD
and eh
so im liked at our store
well I'm talking about typical users
not Apple VIPs
if I were to walk in there
they'd sell me some crap and charge $2000 for t
*it
then you pay the price
less exploding, more worky
OK
13ebay
now keep in mind
like HP xD
I don't work for Microsoft either
and I still get their stuff for cheap
:P
:D
13arn't you a little young to be working for Microsoft
because microsoft uses a fail system on top of a bad filesystem
12Is Roara around?
lol
if you are about speed... :P
from a language and VM perspective, totally yes
not going to discuss about microsoft f;flaming though :P
12I has arts
orly?
what's wrong with NTFS?
anyway
6I'm here
NTFS is the biggest piece of junk when it comes to storing crap
07o3o
it just shares all the memory into one object instead of compiling it individually
13never heard of NTFS
thats why it runs slow the more you have open
here's the specs of my self-built desktop: Intel Core i7 860 (2.8GHz quad with hyperthreading), 8GB of DDR3 RAM, 1600MHz, a NVIDIA GeForce 260GTX card, EVGA version which is factory overclocked, 3x 1TB Hitachi DeskStar
NTFS is a windows filesystem
4im back
Quads burn out quickly on normal PC's
trust me
orly
define an abnormal PC
my friend spent $6k on his and it just went Poof
he had dual quads
wtf?
4 0.0
I spent a little over $1000
same specs as your basically, just rigged nicer
and that's mainly due to the 3 hard drives and the fact that I have a Blu-Ray burner.
13that must be a rip off
12http://a.imagehost.org/0971/Lugia124.jpg
that's another thing Apple computers don't and will never have
13probably from ebey
is Blu-Ray readers, let alone even *burners*
13ebay*
6arti's drawing more lugia <3<3<3
i hate Blu Ray
because I'm still having issues relating to getting mono to work with System.Windows.Forms <_<
07:D
but yeah, windows implementation just pokes inot the native stuff
12TRYING to
thus why i dont care
well I don't.
I like high def
:P
12It looks like a baby Lugia -v-
12it's not supposed to be
mono pokes into wine afaik
13I LOVE IT
6perhaps, but at least you're trying :>
LOL
6I think it looks adorable
That looks like your old style :O
12Yeh maybe
13ITS AWESOME ARTI
im a Graphic / Web Designer
meep
apple works for me
6and looks like a bird
Stable OS for the programs i need to depend on
LOL
that sounds like a troll
/me rofl's at the idea of websites being hosted on a Mac
13its perfect
4S-O C-U-T-E!
that's just hilarious
I use Linux for that
:P
i use Adobe Creative Suit CS5
I dunno exactly about mono's implementation really
/me 13hugs it
don't bother :/
EWWWW ADOBE
one of my apps worked out of the box ;3
dude
i spent $21,000 to go to private college, where we were the first to use the new Mac Pro's
Adobe programs are fricking blaoted
*bloated
just one?
lol
for my type of work professionally, im not allowed to use any other programs
meh Mac pro
6stupid rooster
my desktop is better than mac Pro
13thats now my new favorite picture
12I swear by Adobe for my art, most artists do :>
LOL
6something scared it, now it's making a load of noise
Go use GIMP
or Paint Shop Pro
or something decent
GIMP i cant use for my work
12Gimp and PSP are HORRIUBLE
>implying Adobe is bad
i use it, i lose the job
6I'm struggling to get ahold of photoshop
6I really miss paint sai
GUYS I'M LIKE REALLY SCARED
13I used Gimp one mine and paint

12Well, I don't need to do it LOL
so?
12So I'm not bothered about reinstalling it
LOL
....oh so none of you are here to enjoy the fail
ok then.
I would do a demo video, but the NUS was down just a minute ago when I checked
Barcode scanning on a phone is just lame in general guys
and it has the link
orly
you keep telling yourself that
anyway, 27th August! Avatar rereleased in cinema! With extra footage! :D
I'm also guessing multitasking on a phone is lame?
i do
im happy with what i have and what i dont need
you're just a typical Apple fanboy -_-
07I miss Mibbit already. D:
your the one attacking it as its the worst thing in the world m8
Oe lu nitram!
13then use it
because you're a fanboy
Quany, HAVE YOU TRIED USING CGI:IRC

07It's hard to chat since this chat is now disconnected from my other ones. :P
07Vancouver? o3o

07I was there last week.
13?
12It's like we know you hate Apple, SO WHAT XD
why is it required
:V
the market here only uses proper registered adobe products
and also how do they know if you used it
either you dont have it or you have to go buy it to even get the job
have you even *tried* CGI?
im a Professional Graphic Designer
07Nope.
Click that link

4i know
so yeah, stop talking to the bot
it won't answer
actually
it can, brb
13I'm its friend
13so there
4no i will not stop talking to the bot
actually, none of you are my friends, I hate you all
4ummmm
DRF is my master, however
/me runs
!define rtfm bot
-!- No results found
4yay
!define rtfm
-!- RTFM is an initialism for the direction "Read The <censored> Manual". This instruction is sometimes given in response to a question when the person being asked believes that the question could be easily answered by reading the relevant "manual" or instructions. ...
that's it
:(
6well, tstbot is definately drf's creation
goodbye :)
/me 6runs
/me 13stares at drfÂ¬Â¬
/me 4incinerates the companian cube
/me is pretty much used to crappy routers, even with computers
my wifi
dont work for some reason
!define gtfo
-!- Get the <censored> out; often used to express disbelief
-__-
SIGH
14XD
See, YOU are the one acting like a child here
07Erm...
lol#
as I said - the bot's made of fail :)
07I actually agree with DRF.
you realize how annoying it is for me to keep VNC'ing into it?
and keep fixing what you cause?
/me 13gives drf a ticking cookie
there is a lolcode compiler for .net
just wanted to show how useless the "ignore" of the bot is
4 0.0
4lol
you could call that lol#
by evading it over 9000 times?
13Wb [TSTy}
13]*
well, you forget one thing drf
someone evading a meant ban WILL be GLINED for the rest of his life
and THAT's NOT evadeable
13Really you evaded from getting banned a lot
13of times?
/me 4gets punched in the eye
14Blah, I'll come back when things settle down
evading bans is easy
4x.o ouch...
just use one of the many CGI:IRC clients LOL
/me saw that t, than that it...
/me runs
4someone heal my bad eye
hah
/me 13has nightmares
/me 6pokes the other eye
GTK# too
13kidding
/me yawns
XD
13its um
9 minutes until the meeting :3
Poke one more, and it's a federal offense
/me hides
must they must have done it right to be able to swap the platform specific stuff
13I'm just going to shut up now
4ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
And, a bit off - i can't find any good wii pictures, for making a banner, what pictures do you use?
02agh, i NOW GOT SOMETHING IN MY EYE d:
02caps >_<
and Roara: It's simple. Without pinpointing the weakness there's no motivation to fix the error
/me 13help clean it out
02D:*
6...
do YOU wanna fix the error?
13+s
that script just calls Google
if you define something that you KNOW will get it kicked
it's not my bot, right?
how is it supposed to not define it
and by the way, of us two, YOU are the one with more spare time
yes, but you know darn well that defining things like RTFM will kill it
true, but I don't know perl
4man...
I just got the script from a database
/me sighs
this stupid SysAid software keeps freezing >_>
Qyoto.
there're plenty of books out there to learn it. Or you could ask Arti to put the bot on the not-ban-whitelist. You did none of both
why would Arti do that?
because you ask her for it?
Qt <3
but why would she actually do that?
/me wakes up due to the highlighting.
<3
<3
Hi dear :)
13bye BlackLatios
so the bot wouldn't be kicked if she agrees he's useful?
I mean, if someone does that on accident, that's understandable
but if you keep intentionally killing it 20 times in a row
why should she defend that?
Hello. :3
because there might be other definitions out there also kicking the bot? Like - the first definition of rtfm or gtfo weren't known by me to be able to kick the bot
therefore, because they remove the bot from the chat, it's an error in design that should be fixed
and an error is NOT fixed by closing the eyes and thinking "just don't say it. Then the error won't occur". Sitting-out an error never worked in history and won't work here
4goodbye
12Um hi
07Ohai, Arti.
how would you not know that "get the f*** out" would kick the bot?
6ok but still
4im not leavinig
it's still pretty obvious
6you're the one posting it over and over again o-o
plus if it truly is an accident
I don't mind fixing it
it's just annoying when you keep doing it intentionally
as I have to keep logging into VNC to the server to fix it
no I didn't til now Arti
where is it?
12http://a.imagehost.org/0971/Lugia124.jpg
This building is supposed to closed, but I'm in it :3

4i absoluttly love that arti
/me and about 10 other people
:o
4can you do a lugia called silver please
The chosen ones!
:D

...O_o
14Mibbit fail lol
Gonna be fun though, methinks

12It's not very good Lugia art though btu I'm still trying
07Mibbit. o3o
yeah I know
12Busy now!
14drf, mibbit failed
07*late*
wouldn't put it past him
/me sighs @ Mibbit
07That's busy, lol? :P
and see, this is plenty fast, I don't know why people don't like it
LOL Arti, my shift key sucks
07Brb. Again.
and YES I PUT THE F IN THERE
I'm not banning people out of fun and randomly. Not anymore :P
wth was that?
LOL
Still, Arti
can you fix that @ the server?
so that more people can use Mibbit at once?
as this kinda sucks
i got banned from session w.e
02o3o
yeah so did I
Mibbit sucks like that
agreed
see, I don't mak fun of things for nothing :P
one benefit to CGI:IRC
none of those STUPID emoticons
I wish you could turn those the frick off in Mibbit
it bugs the heck out of me
07You can, I think.
/me checks
how so?
10Hey Shi-shi
07Are you using the Mibbit widget or the site client?
the actual site.
why would I use the widget o.o
02Hey Sky
02Quan!
02I need to know if you'll help me with a picture I drew
07Hey, Shiny.
10o3o
07One sec, gotta help DRF first.
02That's fine
hi all
02Hiya Slash
07You'd need an account to modify the smileys.
hi ^^
07Registered there? :P
Aero
/me glomps
Yes I'm registered
02Looks more like a dog/weasle to me o3o
though since it's currently not working @ TST it does me no good
07Oh.
07Well, for future reference, go to Prefs, smileys, and delete all of them.
10XD
delete them?
lemme try
I'm still on Mibbit on another server
LOL my font just got bigger
since I once set it that way
07Don't forget to save your setting afterwards.
OK
/me sprawls out on Slash
Quany, what's the default font size?
as I changed it
I need to change it back
0715.
02Did you see my picture I posted in the cbox? o3o
10Yus
.....
it IS on 15
10It reminds me of something off of Narnia
why's it so big?
inb4 "that's what she said"
07o.O
07Is it the window itself?
07Control + scroll wheel?
02:U
no
it just got bigger when I logged inm.
-m
I like the default size for when you're not logged in
02The only pictures I've been looking at for references were deer/caribu feet and my memories of my dream
So is this Epic?
oh wait
nvm
it was on 16
10Then you have epic skills at not intentionally referencing other things LOL
what's the usual font for the channel tabs at the top?
*that's* what I made bigger
er size
/me falls out of bed
um... yes? :o
07I don't think you can change that's sizes.
07If messed, you could just try defaulting everything.
oh
how do you default everything?
02I do have epic skills don't I? |D *shot*
:Ð· / :Ð / :3 / :Â³ / Ñ: / E: / :Ð­ / Ð: / :Ñ
hi all
02Hiya Sneas
is anybody here?
? list
07Right below My perefences, to the right of Save and Close
? usenet
aha
thanks, that did the trick
now lemme redo the smileys...
can you make Mibbit auto-connect like mIRC can?
hi
07No, but you can set up a one-click connect.
is there a lisp binding? :p
10!sneas
/me now belongs to Skylands for 14 minutes
07You can set up a script to instantly join any channel.
07Ghost, etc.
one click?
^^
10:3
02I swear if I tried to make my character's body fluffy I'd be torn apart
07Two, since you have to click the Account tab.
o.o
well
I told it to autologin
10Floofy would make more sense
/me hides
02It would be like: "I wanna hug his floof, but I don't wanna die"
07Okay.
so how would I do it
07Under account:
10I wonder how many deaths floof has caused
02Suffocating
helooooooo
07Under IRC server details.
07Add your info.
It is not. Clearly.
07It doesn't have a join-channel box, so scripts come in there.
07I think.
02Btw, you'e made me curious, what does my character look similar to in Narnia?
ah
I'll just do it manually
shhhh
as it wants my default nickname
10One of the hybrids
they're not supposed to know that!
07Okay.
10Dunno which one it was
07You can put two entries. :P
10It was like a cross of minotaur and goat
10or maybe I'm just thinking of Runescape
/me shrugs
I'm going to write my own binding soon
it's soooo easy to make bindings in lisp compared to other languages
only when I'm not at home
D:
drf|library etc XD
02I wish it was more original then :<
I made a defcarray function =D
/me shuts up and sits in the corner.
07Okay.
02I wanted to put rib bones on his neck but then I figured out that he would seem more like Girantina after that
nvm, the smileys thing shoudl be fixed
I wonder if it'll work on TST again
I think you'll love it once you learn it
10lulz
nope.
07:/
/me sighs
Seriously, Articuno or somebody, fix it plz?
it's been around longer then C, beat that!
on freenode? :>
Yeah, I know.
yeah

From the railconf link
Also, where can I read up on their Python stuff?

i have a league in van
im planning the 1st Annual Isshu Pokethon
04omg guys
04there was a bat in the house >_>
02:O
02What did you do?
10Note to self: Bats hate fireworks
04chased it outside?
for those who are interested
04my mother got the idea of spraying it with butterspray
04which was quite effective
02And getting hit in the head with hammers
02...and dying
10We shot one off and it nearly killed it
04we took it outside
04i'm not going to kill a bat, they eat mosquitos
10I was like "No D:"
04i hate mosquitos
-.-
04if bats are going to eat their weight in mosquitos everynight i'm not going to care if they exist as long as they don't get inside lol
>:3
Mdow
Meow
:c sky
02Well...my dad's excuse was that he didn't know what the bat was going to do
02It was broad daylight and this bat flew out right at him
12Wtf
LOL WHAT
07o3o
Arti
12WHAT THE HELL
can you do me a favor?
and LOOOL
07Is that Mibbit or no?
Anyway
Articuno
/os exception add +0 *.mibbit.com 50 reason <-- can you type that?
that will make it so you can have 50 Mibbit users at once
and we won't keep getting kicked off
12Done
hello
12Wait
07D:
07Dang you, false alarm.
12Ovo

12LLOL
04i see
07Uh.
02It didn't get into our house, my dad was outside
04i see
Hey.
04but i'm asking the question to myself lol
what's up
heh i've had bats get into my house
then again when you live in 100 year old houses
:x
anything goes
normally i use a net to catch it
though there was one, that was bleed as it slammed against something glass, and i had to kill it since it couldn't fly anymore either..
bleeding*
04hmm
04we are going to get a tennis racket now XD
nou
oh, I figured it out
when she gets back
or somebody
I am
OK
can you try that?
I think it errored since the /os alias isn't set
hi
already tried, but I'm receiving the same message like Arti
Back!
Hi
There is a pretty hot girl in front of me right now >.>
Like a few feet away from me
possibly because this command is not supported by our IRC server
huh
well I tried it, and got an error saying I'm not authorized
not a "no such nick/channel"
hmm
is it worth the money
Much better than torrents for everything?
it does suck when a bat gets stuck in your house
:3
though like i said, that's why i have a net handy if something like that gets in
i've also had to deal with birds
Curly!
:D
I believe that's a command only the server owner can do
oh
OK
well then it does in fact work, we just need Articuno to do it
I think it's just /os that isn't set by the server
possibly, yeah
Hey.
HELLO.
HOW ARE YOU.
:|
OK
Fine thanks, you?
I'll wait for her to get back, then
bored.
rendering more betas.
ugh.
Nice.

3your not using it :)
*you're
hi RN
again
04thanks
/me is not late
well yeah, because I'm at work
03I COULD use it though
03I'm just far too lazy
i wanna learn how to make sprites
07For the competition? C:
Sprite a knight
:O
no
Meow
sprite a Sierra Mist
XD
Sprie a -
make a Sprite of Sprite?
*Sprite a bottle of sprite
Sprite Sir Kipi
meowthings
no way
Sierra Mist is more fun
or Smist as somebody I knew IRL called it XD
:3
3just put pokemon parts together, then match up the colors
07Not what to make. :P
07Easy for you to say, Volt.
yeah, that's basically all there is to it -_-
07That'd be a newb's way.
here's what you do
take a picture
resize it to 16x16
and you have a sprite
/me hides
02Lol Quan I was just thinking that earlier today
07Erm, no.
orly?
in before tl;dr
as I'm quite sure that would work
07Nope.
07You get a big blur.
>:3
http://www.brothersoft.com/games/easy-sprite-maker.html
I'ma shower now.
http://spritegen.website-performance.org/ <-- an online version
>:P
07No images? No proof? Any ratings?
I'll try it right now./
02lol
oh sigh
it needs at least 2 pictures LOL
07o3o
07Uh?
CSS sprites are the wrong thing I think
07Lol.
http://www.famitsu.com/freegame/tool/chibi/index1.html LOL
Japanese character sprite maker
that's only for humans though
07Sure, but that's someone else's work for your use.
OK well I'm to lazy to find something here
but I'm sure there are programs that can do it fine.
07Suuuuuuuure, and there are programs which can make full-blown miscellaneous digital artwork!
07>>
there are
it's called a camera
/me hides
Back
07Camera is photography. :P
07Digital =/= Photography.
orly?
how is a JPG file not digital?
that's precisely the point of a digital camera - to turn something IRL into something digital
XD
Hey guys
I just got the astra web
/me ywans
07Lol, if you say that's the case, then a big scribble done on the computer is technically digital art.
which port is it best to use
and how do i setup ssl?
02I'm off to bed for a nap, cya guys
lol
you know they have all this on thier page
by technical definition even a photograph on film is digital, as it does have a resolution, it's just very fine and non-regular
it is.
what ports to use, server addresses, what ports for ssl etc
not really
35mm film is analog
lol some people are retarded
it has no set resolution
you can just scan it into one
hence how Blu-Rays are made
by rescanning 50 year old movies
no set resolution, but there is a resolution
not really
oh when i signed up it just spit out id pass and a bunch of ports it said i could use
and digital's definition is that whatever is stored is discrete, hence anything with a resolution is digital
ill go look around thanks
Nuh uh
astra web what a loser
I'll see her around though :3
...XD
I'll feel them next week at the dance :) maybe
:D
LOL
whats wrong with astra web?
Oh, hi btw.
I gotta go home now, I'll be back in about 45
<3
Byeeeeeeeee
is it?
Bai Stoneari
!define digital
-!- displaying numbers rather than scale positions; "digital clock"; "digital readout"
that is the definition of digital, yes
oh wow it works again
Nothing is wrong with astra.
only took a few hours
what does?
mibbit refused to let me on
07What, Mibbit?
i will blaze astraweb anyday
oh
Quany, got another question for you.
07Yes?
Is it possible to have Mibbit show the full hostmask?
6ew name+y
I hate how it hides it
07Yep.
analogue by comparison is continuous, hence the scale positions mentioned in that definition
Aurora, orly?
I just took the first 5 letters
07Hold on, lemme find it on the page:
it's like saying my name, Danny, is Dann + y
not really, it just ends in a y...
6but quan's nickname is quan
i just signed on with astraweb after being with giganews since 06
My MW2 disc is broken
I'm FINALLY FREE
it's pretty damn good
!!!

ohai work
but there is no need for bannerbomb if you just get one of those wiixplorer channnels or loadmeh *is proud of self-made channels*

the main characters are two guys. maybe they're bi though but either way that interpretation is wrong :o

Servers on windows is just....

okay so

Not much at all. Maybe 3MB.
it shouldn't really matter for a small server
hey is it posible for a wii to read a certain media (niponic) that another wii cant read (disc error) ?
I've got this micro SDHC card which I've been using with my Wii for a while
I have >!
>1 898 MB
:(
Trying to use it to add homebrew channel
And XP lol
right
I think I have 500mB of ram
Unfortunately: A) I don't know what it's formatted as
/me has a sleep.
A) It's very likely FAT, so you should be fine - if it doesn't work, though, try reformatting
Curly, really?
mmhm
yes
it's an upgrade from my last computer
You could buy a nice box o' RAM
it had 256mB
B) None of my usual card readers will accept it, but my phone works with it, so file transfers are possible, if grueling--is this a problem?
I don't has money
My other one had 112MB
how long ago did you have that?
I mean, I've installed WiiWare software on it from my console so obviously it works
~3 years
Then I got a laptop
(eew)
I want a laptop
o3o
so I can lay down in bed and chat :D
This one had 256MBs at first D:
B) Shouldn't be a problem
Then I added a 1GB stick.
And then I added a 512MB stick!
but why can't your usual readers accept it?
that's a little odd
mishaps with websites, always fun to fix, but never to eat D:
do none of them support SDHC?
my brother's computer has 2*500mB with 2 free slots
I should upgrade that :I
I haven't been able to figure that out yet, so far I'm blaming it on faulty readers, I haven't tested them with other cards yet
I only have 2 slots. :(
But I've had two that just freeze up My Computer when I try to read the drive the SDHC card is in
When I unplug them they tell me it needs to be formatted
:/
Probably don't support SDHC
yeah
XD
isn't that the truth? X3
/me goes to get ready
Anyway, I've got file transferring working but it is a pain
Oh, on the CustomizeMii thingy, does it matter if the .dol is named boot.dol?
Sorry to interrupt

Period needed to end that first sentence
actually, no
make sure you have wireless
as it doesn't use a savegame
lol
you should be fine
Okay, loading...\
lol
as I say, some phones can unset the archive bit, which causes save games not to show up
Now what?
now, load up customizemii. it should have two big buttons at the bottom of the window. click send wad.
they are a laptop series now
then, type in the ip address of the wii
(get it from the hbc)
click send
then, it should be transferred to the wii, and load up an installer.

The 24/7 thing
What about "IOS to use for installation?" Leave it blank? Or put in 36?
Back!

If my browser will ever come up
That should speed things up

Good relative evening people.
IOS 80 is the unknown. They want to have the rules know. there's you 3 seconds explination as to why they havn't chosen IOS 80 :p

It's still afternoon here XD

"Because unauthorized channels or firmware may impair game play or the Wii console, updating to Wii Menu version 4.3 will check for and automatically remove such unauthorized files"
"Index (zero based) must be greater than or equal to zero and less than the size of the argument list." CustomizeMii is spitting that at me. What does that mean? :P
Good thing system menu =/= firmware
:P Exactly

I got the installer and bannerbomb on the SDHC
That all I need?
And some tweezers :p
my makeups D:
i bought a ntsc wii last month

is it possible to mod it wii-key

:o
/me is wearing a bra though!
ouch
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmQFcVR6vEs&feature=player_embedded
/me defeats the water
"This is illegal, you know"
also 28% humidity?
wow
/me did not have that in mind actually D:
that must be a record for Vancouver
/me just thought of halping the Curly defeat the temperature without ruining her makeup D:
hi everybody
/me is having a hard time imagining someone pouring water on a girl's chest without having naughty thoughts about it
I sometimes wonder if the people who work on the wii system menu intentionally mess stuff up so they have a job to do instead of just getting unpaid leave or something
My mind is too absent to have thoughts about things D:
suuuure it is :p
lolwut
no she does not :O
THanks :)
Wai? :x
/me still wonders if Ari's being DDoSed
xD
Just hopping on someone's connection
<3 people with "linksys" router names
Actually, beta testing is a lot about trying to break something
yeah, that was happening all day yesterday too
I also wonder if ninty would have acted on the homebrew scene as soon as they did because of datel bringing the hacks to "common people" (region free disc, was it?)
Their Freeloader disc?
I dunno
yeah
/me is on a different IP
That's because I'm using SSL
Nintendo should've listened to TT
Beta? I break stuff ALL the time. I seem to have a nose for screwing stuff up
Just something silly with Insp 2.0
Throughout my life I've broken a PC about once a year on average
Mrr
hmm
I'm just kidding D:
From birth
what type of b reak?
It's 19:07 here.
More breaking code, causing it to crash, make games unplayable, ect
Mrm.
physical or software?
xD
:s/LO/LOL
Super Mario... with several other NES game characters... like, Link, the Contra Guy, Samus...
software
I do not like this game. D:
/me cries.
"Index (zero based) must be greater than or equal to zero and less than the size of the argument list." CustomizeMii is spitting that at me. What does that mean?
Remind me what customizemii does
It allows one to create a custom channel,
For future use if I decide to update to 4.3
/me checks the time
got to go >.>
bye!
D:
/me clings to Curly.
Does 4.3 break custom channels
?
no
"Go on, before security comes!" She says as they bash my head in. ._.;
I hate Bethesda.
/me forces Curly to stay.
4.3 would break the LoadMii channel I think
:o
maybe not
but it breaks pretty much everything else
Prolly not
ninty never thinks of the small things
This error is starting to get on my nerves
Does customize me use .net?
what's wrong?
yes
"Index (zero based) must be greater than or equal to zero and less than the size of the argument list."
Hehe
GTFOI
(GET THE FUCK OVER IT
Bai, Curly :o
lol, okay okay
mrow
I wish I could easily upgrade a GB of RAM
Guys can somebody help
Just stick it in.

followed 2 guides and made a mistake :(
the one that banner bricked
Ohhh

The one guide specificly say NOT VER 3348 :(
13or a baby spoon
I'm kind of hesitant to mess with HBC and stuff
not sure whether it'll brick me or not
ok got dop-mii
Well, the HBC WON'T brick you by any means
HBC won't brick you
BABY
I think a cookie is in order
Installing HBC is safer than updating to 4.2 through Nintendo
lol
Whats the best movie player for wii that plays AVI, and (possibly?) from usb w/o any IOS?
THAT's how awesome it is
haha

USB FTW!!!
Where's all these new people coming from? O_o

It'll only install IOS

How do I fix not being able to install as boot2?

4.2 is the version, the U in front of it, means its from USA/CANADA
je ne sais pas

You can't fix it
if it read 4.2E it means its from EUROPE
so 4.2U is diferent the 4.2E
Isn't it c'est?

It came with my Wiikey a while back before i softmodded
|:/

More like Dennis.
;o

should i drop protection b4 the wep?
you dont need an SD to install wad manager
/me now belongs to Skylands for 4 minutes
/me now belongs to Skylands for 8 minutes
hmm, it's possible to use another USB to hard drive (for games) and the another to ie. memory stick for wiimc or Mplayer CE?
You can install it to your wii from a USB HDD FAT32 Partition
why use 2 drives?
format it all fat32
and have it on same drive
can i use a sd card with usb adaptor as an external hard drive to play iso's off of?
yes
but thats stupid and expensive
03x3
i found a 16gb sd card for $15
shadow what do i do first
fuck my life
and i have a usb adaptor
Cant i install wiimc w/o wad?
its for my sister inlaw
i dont want to buy her a 320gb external or anything
outch
wiimcthe wad is only the forwarder ...
almost a buck a meg
thats expensive
a gig
a gig a buck
my bad
how do i drop protection
on a wifi conn
lol
put that in your browser
sigh channel full of n00bs tonight
thanks shadow
go to the wifi tab
04lol

=p
jk dont bane me
lol

wtf
im just tryin to get my wii on my wifi
cuz thats step #1
laptop on wifi ? get router address from pc
and put the manual settings
from notebook to wii right?
is your wifi router not broadcasting ?
ROTFLMAO
i had to fuck with u when u asked were to go put that address in
when i told u already
my wifi router is broadcasting
i put in the wifi name/and my wep key
04ohai
Anyone here use Genplus?
and i get error code some shit
put that in your browser
04Skylands!
ok
/me hugs
now whagt
like i told u already
then go to wifi tab
drop the protection down to wep
try setting router to broadcast on channel 1 or 11
ok :)
set a password u knpow
for wifi
like your phone number
with area code
no dash's
or spaces
so 4445556666
whatever yours is
somthing u can remeber
now go to wii search fpor wifi connection
put in wep
10Heya
connect
then say no to updating
/me returns the hug
and follow the guide
...
yeah but apparently it doesnt suppose some common files
like SMS and such
ohai drake
well, I'd be kinda surprised if it did
given the SMS is the master system, not the genesis...
how you o3o
isnt the next ds going to be 3d with no glasses?
I know fusion does both but that's more the exception than the rule
yeah but there was on on xbox a while back that did them all
so was seeing if wii had one similar
04good
04you?
Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
hey shadow
SMSPlus for SMS/GG on Wii
sms is sega master system the 8-bit system before the genesis
genesis is 16-bit
yes, we just had this conversation, lol
yeah sms had shinobi
ok i got it online
i dont wanna update right?
have you guys heard any new news on the gc loader for wii
04ah bugger I need to go
and LOL bye Xd
i know which is which
i didnt get a genesis until SFII championship edition came out
ok i changed it to wep
It stands to reason that he's already using wep
i was asking if there was an emulator for teh wii that did them all
i dont update the system right?
then i got the cool 6 button controller
there is one on xbox that did them all
Also, only some routers use 192.168.1.1
which emulator was that digtital
on wii
Also, though wep is easily cracked, it's not nearly the same as "removing protection"
evil thanks fuck me
im have to check xbins but it did support all the major sega platforms
is there a way in the sys to turn "updating" off permanently
Hehe, you're back :D
:o
no more questions from u
get to softmodding
:D
use priiloader to block online and disc updates
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPPCvVmx5Ho&feature=related 3-d NDS
noone else answer his questions
viince
both your nicks r so close
ah, ok :)
viince you want to see this one http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7detDcmMKY
ok so im online im gonna put this shit on the SD Card
Thats teh real Nintendo 3DS Demo
hi
ugh, I hate youtube
<viince> ugh, I hate you(tube)
i see that but u cant realy see the actual 3d on it
fuckers
Exception (DSI) occured!
what the heck
Homebrew Browser is mean
what do u mean its only jap dsi ware?
softmod for 4.2SD is downloading now
hbb... meh
and i have a boner
lol
im gonna put this shit on the SD card
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPPCvVmx5Ho&feature=related is disware witch is avalible in japan dsiware shop now
O_O
STACK DUMP and CORE DUMP
that doesn't look good
its been xtracted on the SD card!
code dump*
jappan DSiWare only
oh
do u not understand
._.
yes i suppose a core dump would be strange for a wi i
DSiWare is region lockled
*wii
press the reset button on the wii
k, pressed
Brought me back to Homebrew Channel
is it? I must have just not hit anything outside my region then
Alright, on my way home
oh, dsi
never mind
n00bs
So how do I fix this very scary-looking error message
I never can at 1:30am particularly well
now u won't be on ur way home :P
you dont is the simple answer
The author of the program does
plus I've been desining a website for most of the day and that always turns my brain to cotton wool
LOL
yea
no i did not get the 2 confused
snap!
since 1 game is 3d and not a 3DS
what you need hbb for anyhow?
so much for browser being a good app
he was confused
I dunno, someone recommended
it's boring shit but it'll likely get me a ps3 so I'll put up with it
hbb is nice...i like it..........when it works
true
yup
whatever pays the bills u know
Agreed
once you'd done a run-through of it's offering you don't really need it
I don't have a PS3 yet, lol, but FF:XIII might well get bought so it's not in crappy resolution
I played FF13 on 360 i dont like it
and not because of the graphics
the game is boring as hell
and the maps are so linear
hrm, apparently it picks up later on
Straight line mapping is WEAK
but I dunno, I've not liked the linear nature of recent ones tbh
yeah like 40 hours later
/me glares in the direction of crisis core
bought a PSP for that one
you'd think I'd learn
what do you mean by that?
In the settings, you can change the repository from which you can download homebrew
i havent booted my PSP in months and when i did boot it that was to update firmware for no damn reason at all
PSP is probably teh worse handheld i have ever owned
and without homebrew it would have never made it this long
ah, never had a wonderswan crystal then
or an original GBA
or a GBC come to taht
I had a wonderswan but i dont count that since i returned it to play-asia
i told them it didnt work when really it just sucked
I don't like non backlit colour screens
Gamegear was before its time sadly :(
you need to be outside in the middle of summer before they work
I had one of those as a teenager
but it cost a fortune to keep it fed
and yes, I know there were NiCads but they didn't last long compared to alkaline batteries
once im done modding can i turn back to WPA2-Personal?
my network is unsecure now
in hbb?
Yup
no shit?
Oh
yes, just think of all the people lurking in the shadows with their laptops, waiting to steal your bandwidth
i mean... does hbb have default locations to check or do you input an address?
!silence
/me says "BREAK THE SILENCE!!!!!!!"
It has default ones to check
Yup
It's already built in
Afterwards, insert the SD Card into the Wii. A Pop up saying Load boot.dol/elf? should appear. Select Yes. this part didnt come up?
04!balloon
i should check that out
It's awesome
I dunno if you can add more repos
i have to download the new version... auto-update is broken on mine for some silly reason
That sucks
yeah, it's odd
What error does it give when doing that?
?
hold on, just got a new sdhc card, gonna copy contents from old card then check it out
hey, you know if there is a list of what the best configuration of IOS's to have installed on your wii is?
or does it not matter?
I don't think so. It's usually best to have the latest revisions of all your IOSes
that's what i would've thought
:O I just thought of something... I can say that I can brick the Wii and never repair it to my siblings as a threat... But that'd be mean.
:3
you have to follow through with it
to show'em you mean business
follow exactly as said
Install an application that automatically boots the Wii into Never Gonna Give You Up looped unless you input Konami Code
you probably went in the wrong menu
should i prepare the bootmii as an SD card
Does such an app exist?
XD
oh man
that's a good idea
what's the dev chan?
i dont think my sys could boot it as 'boot2'
or w/e
hey shadow what is the easiest way to install dls for guitar hero 5
Hmmm
It doesn't exist, but there's apps that run apps at startup I believe
Perhaps I could try to make an app like that
i have a request for an app
I am still learning C++, and that could be a project
no clue
and i don't know why no one has made it yet
i inst bootmii an IOS and installed homebrew channel
I dunno HOW I could make it though
you should prepare the card
all the program would do is completely shut your wii down (so the light on the power button is red)
lololol
ok so i inst homebrew and bootmii but i should also prepare the card too right?
what card
my birthday card
SD card
i'm serious. i have an external hdd hooked up to my wii and the stupid hdd activity light wont shut off until the wii is completely powered down
u should format your sd to proper FAT, thats about all the prep there is
the only way i know to get it to do that is to walk up to the wii and hold down the power button the front of it
i have a Q...
STFU
i know i dont
but i have to see what lebron is doin @ 7
so i may have to put this mod shit on hold
I want to use the wii shop channel, but it tells me i HAVE to update to use it, is there a way around this? i just want free demos
Eh, I've never had to use it
wad manager
Wow, the SuperTux Wii Edition game is awesome
should i 'prepare the SD card'
yes
k
it sucks. i sleep in the same room as my wii. so i have a bright blue light coming from my hdd if i don't fully power down my wii.
what is that?
cuz i already ins homebrew chan and the other thing
wb
ty
wad manager, sounds like a porno title
the only thing i didnt do is DVDx and i have a feeling thats just for ripping shit
u need to prep as hackmii installer tells u to for bootmii
:O
Go download it nao
Do I need the USB 2.0 thing do be able to play DVDs on MPlayer CE or just DVDx?
10Hiya Altair :>
For MPlayerCE, I believe you can use DVDx
anyone use wiiMC?
I do
:D
cIOS 202 specifically
Hiya Shiny ^^'
people really don't know what it's for
you ever had a problem with the audio not syncing with dvd?
Smashing?
hio
yes
awesome arcade target shooter
actual 3d!
:O
not open source though :'(
Gimme link nao
Should I download r590 or 0.76
Awww
(
I have a feeling 0.76 is more stable
*:(
dvdx, you questioned me about it a week or two ago
http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Smashing!
Back!
watch the video
if they cant read will fuck em
>talking about dubstep
<drac> its like random noises thrown into a blender and put on 'NUKE' setting
10Huh? Shiny? XD
/me is not Shiny
sounds like aphex twin
Holy crap
wow
That looks AWESOME
:D
that is really polished
mmhmm :D
haha nice
ohai icy
That's WiiWare quality right there
hio again
indeed
Lebron
independent game designers have admirable coding abilities and drive
If you hired say fifty of them for a designing army you could churn out the best games ever on a regular basis
Turn an unrecognized indie brand into a fully-realized corporate giant
a lot of indie developers aren't on a schedule like a regular enterprise is
but it wouldn't be fun anymore
Has any one here ever played any of the old King's Quest series of games?
Number V is driving my nuts because of this one damn puzzle.
heres the deal
Yah
im gonna prepare the SD card
i wish there was a wiiware version of netflix
YES
whats up :O
im a little slow cuz im seein wtf lebron james is gonna do
instead of having to load it off the stupid disc
03Hewwo o.o
dubstep is drums and echos
too much stupid suspense just tell me already
I wish there was a WiiWare version of Pandora
speaking of which
i'm on pandora right now
nothing much
Is there a homebrew Pandora client
hyperdub or go home
that would be beautiful
im all about jungle
I don't think so
But it DEFINITELY would be possible
/me squeaks.
:( HBB frose
"Stupid cat... stop eating the rat before I can type 'throw boot'!" or "Stupid cat... stop eating the rat before I have the boot." or "Stupid cat... stop eating the mouse when I enter from the wrong side of the screen!"
*froze
curse and reset
12o-o
I tried running Pandora in the Opera browser on the Wii
said not enough memory
****ing thing doesn't work
Okay, resetting
There
with or without lebron u seem like your going at the same speed
witch is SLOW
I've read too much WiiBrew wiki
I know too much
lol
I want an app that will run Brawl when I use Smash Stack
So I'll use the stack
And infinitely loop
hey guys
You want it to infinitely stack and smash? :3
Yes
And a visual representation of the Brawl logo exploding and rebuilding
is the homebrew channel in a downloadable and installable version anywhere?
lol
whats up SR
yes
whats that mean
It's a shame that the Twilight Hack never got out of beta
:3
www.bootmii.org
get the hackmii installer
i grabbed that
can that run from the homebrew chan somehow? [older version]
ok install it then
6Hey, those old Sierra games are like that.
How come when I load MPlayer CE it's cut off at the top and bottom
Wii is set to widescreen, that shouldn't happen
That's weird
:P I remember when my little brother and I would have movie night every night after I hacked the Wii
Also annoying, King's Quest VI... the stupid copy protection puzzle; "No I don't have the ruddy manual... but I do have the original CD... STOP MAKING ME DO COPY PROTECTION JUNK!"
*I installed homebrew
(It's the same with LSL2... but luckily there is always Al Lowe's website. :P )
how is people?
its all about bootmii
Tired
bored
you know the usual
http://imgur.com/627lz.jpg its all about wiimc
how is you?
its all about getting this fuckin thing modded in like 1 hr so i can play super mario galaxy 2
once i get to the pt of playing should i just use an ext hdd?
Smashing beats Link's Crossbow Training by a longshot
or can i load it on SD card?
lol
wiimc is nice...but I prefer my wdtv :P
*long shot
WDtV ftw
wdtv?
Although Sierra copy protection is annoying... the games are still hilarious and fun.
doesnt even buffer my 41gb untouched BR of avatar
ehh, I'm all right. could be better
i'm doing a xbmc ion setup
(Though... some of the "hunt the pixel" puzzles get old quick.)
plays that fucker smooth
and clan
clean*
:/
all copy protection is annoying yet easy to fix lol
crossbow... longshot...
ok once my SD card is "prepared" do i need to use the NAND backup?
!define flamming
-!- FlÃ¥m is a Norwegian village with some 500 inhabitants, at the inner end of the Aurlandsfjord, an arm of the Sognefjord. The town is located in the municipality of Aurland, in Sogn og Fjordane county, Norway.
er back up my NAND
fail XD
lol
always backup your nand
you really should just read the damn guide and do it
shadow ur tight :)
X3
running xbmc
im adding u as my "e-buddy" on merk
whether u like it or not
Unintended effect, thar
Smashing should have it's own channel
and then every time i see my pchinterface i wanna puke
Now THAT would be awesome
however /add is a unknowncommand
lol
i have 2 boxes
there a site for hbb or is it just through wiibrew?
ha
Altair: Not the specific copy protection of old Sierra DOS games... then the copy protection is in game, and requires the manual.
I think through WiiBrew Only
*only
(But otherwise... you can make as many copies of the CD/diskettes as you want. :P )
04o-o
both 100% working
then the gc, the ps2, the 360, and workingon getting a wii
wow...0_o
0.3.8 latest version?
03LOL
Yup
03Commander Keen 6 had copy protection like that
cool
03where you had to put in the name of the character
03somebody cracked it though XD
Or you can just play one of Al Lowe's LSL games...
also how do i get the common key, do you know?
Where the copy protection is either... non-existant (LSL1), easy to bypass (LSL2), he gives you the stuff to craxx0rz (all of them).
Out of your own Wii? Make a NAND dump with BootMii and I believe you can look in the keys.bin file it outputs
(LSL2: Can be bypassed by using... Al Lowe's birthday as the "phone number" - but you do miss the cutscene, it is a developer's "skipping" tool.)
xD http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6622I420100703
after i spend 8 hrs modding this i will def need to get somethin to play GC games or emu shit

Any way to fix MP CE cutoff?
with a serial of 8947

It may be a r590 issue

oh shit
told u im half righ tard
LU3972
LU64+ are mostly the new
still have to burn gc
so is mine old enuf?
maybe, try playing a dvd with wiimc
(And LSL1... well better brush up on trivia about the 60s and 70s. :P )
commercial video dvd isn't dvd-r
so GC takes DVD-r?
backups, yes
what about ext HDD
Try v0.76
you cant play gc on usb hdd unless you drop another $100 on a wode
im not droppin shit
esp if i can just play from dvd-r
:)

what files do i del from SD card after i backup the mii wad shit
do i del everything off the SD card?
it's hbb
if it does it repeatedly, reinstall it
it'll keep the list of apps, it does that by scanning your card
. Once these files/folders are on your PC, delete them from your SD Card (what are they referring to?)
which files/folders?
what step
i just put a fresh install on there
? softmod
put it on again
wb drf
does it die during the image download?
when it starts up for the first time?
i think so
try skipping that
03thanks

what fuckin step r u on
damn
but i just backed up everything on the SD
then just fucking do that...
12Drf is a big chatter
Once these files/folders are on your PC, delete them from your SD Card. If you do not and bootmii as boot2 is installed, it will load everytime!

03...
03How are you watching videos then?!
Better yet, give me a scenario where a brick would occur, and I'll try to get out of it
It's the latest update to Clirc
30 or 36
03:O
03does it have a web browser?
:O
Nope
03then what's it do?
upgrade to 4.2 then downgrade to 3.3
You get someone else's laptop
And view videos there
Ain't it amazing?
03LOL
03I thought you were being serious for a second
Oooo, delete IOS30
03so how do you paste the links here? o.o;
But it's a stub
I didn't
And it would't make a difference if I downgraded with DOP-Mii
XP
03you typed that whole thing?
It wasn't a long or complicated link, drf.
03I suppose
03but wait
lololol, delete 1-2
03if you have a laptop, why 'not just use IRC on it?
Because it sucks.
03what?
03if it's good enough to watch streaming videos
03it's good enough to run mIRC
Maybe, but the keyboard makes me want to punch cattle
03LOL
It likes to go back whenever I hit backspace
03that's... the point
03web browsers are SUPPOSED to go back when you hit backspace
03mIRC does not have that problem
For?
And for some reason, when I'm in the middle of typing, the type cursor thing appears in a random place
this is the third time I'm deleting and redownloading everything for devkitPro
Patroller
03that's the trackpad's fault, probably
03mine does that too
make error 2
anybody got the scoop on this oen?
03and you can usually turn the trackpad off, if you use an external mouse XD
huh?
There is no mouse
03no I know
03I mean, get one
oh
03you can buy a mouse for like $5
I'm getting a make error on the example projects
\o/
I googled it too, but it's dumb people arguing with no solution
Welcome back, Argen.... oh :3
I'm not gonna buy a mouse for my cousin's laptop. XP
03he's just letting you borrow it?
Woooo, I bricked my Wii
No moar Wii XD
She

what did you do?
03she's just letting you borrow it?
I "accidentally" installed a stub IOS30 after I downgraded to System Menu 3.2

Hi, I have a problem with USB Loader GX. Firstly, I have DVDX installed, and I'm running 4.2 softmod. I also have a D3-2 drive. I am unable to install games to disk. When I try, I get a dialog briefly popping up, saying "Waiting for disc," but it vanishes within half a second, leaving me at a blank screen with a working Wiimote, but unable to do anything. I tried checking for updates, but it said there wasn't any updates available. I checked on the Go
ogle Code page, and there was indeed a newer version available, revision 938. I removed the old GX, installed the new one, and tried installing again. This time it doesn't even go to the dialog, it just blinks and returns to the game selection interface. Any ideas on what could be causing this?
/me watches you sink to the bottom of the ocean to forever sit there
/me can also defy the laws of physics
/me turns on water power
/me shoots a portal on the moon and at the bottom of the ocean
/me transforms to a moon rover
/me notes that with the force of the ocean pressing you down, you shot into space and are floating away
/me goes spaceship
first... dvdx has nothing to do with it, second are you using original dvds? and third, cfgloader ftw :p
yes CFGLodare FTFW!!!
sexual, doesn't DVDX make the drive available to homebrew? and yes, original DVDs, wanna rip the two wii sports games so I don't have to use the discs
/me cuts you in half with a chainsaw and throws you into the sun
its for "data dvds"
like movies etc
its just an ios
aha
i see
/me makes burgers on the sun
/me falls asleep
does cfgloader have a website?
could only find a thread on gbatemp
nice
it supports wbfs right? =)
dont be a asshole
/me blows up sun
saying wizeass comments like that
/me sighs
huh
we r trying to help u and u wanna shit on it
hi.
NOOOOO
the hell are you on about?
It was all orange
/me doesn't freeze
lol it was a joke, do you see the ":P"?
does fucking matter
...
cool stor ybro
/me curls up in the corner of the rafters
Aww
I thought the tongue sticking out meant "fuck you"
XD
yes it does
is there an alternative download source to that sendspace link? can't download
yes u can downlaod
jsut tuen off your blockers
have no blockers, it says "the service is at full capacity"
refresh

nvm tried again and it worked now
thanks for the link
/me hugs..
/me comes back and is killed by purpletext overload

how do I install the new shop channel ?
u lube it up all nice and good and u shove it right in there
thanks thats helpfull
i try
and u spelled helpful wrong
found searching forums: dop-mii
03what, you mean like the "Hitler [blah]" videos?
english is not my first language
? softmod
but thanks, ill try to remember that
=D
http://sharingmatrix.com/file/1005427/Shopping_Channel-NUS-v18.rar
this is whats in the 3.1-4.1 guide
but id say just follow the whole guide
thanks, but version v18 is old and doesnt work anymore
its the one I had
i found that I need to download dop-mii
and dop-mii will install it for me
Hmmm, maybe I should brick the Wii every night
So the siblings can't access it
Dop-Mii -- DOP-Mii Download
Start HBC - Load Dop-Mii -- Press A at the warning.
Select IOS249 or 250 --(Use the D-Pad) -- Press A
Select "Channels" -- Press A
Install Shopping Channel v19
If you need the wad File then update your NUSD database and download Shopping channel v19 and select pack to wad.
or parental lock ;o
lol Or that
:P
bye all
people do all sorts of funny things to keep friends off the wii
Like bricking? XD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enHg3XrhsHk ahh memories of playin sega genesis
2gtg now
2cya guys~
worked
how about a homebrew solution that straps onto bootmii, requires a code?
it'd have to have a cool ui, though
cool UIs are boring
whuuuut. it's the the user experience. a cool program like a wii login should look amazing
2.0 gloss and everything
i just want a black screen with console text "Enter password: "
and it wouldn't even have special glyphs, if you pressed up it would be ^
or not even anything, like sudo
so the entire UI is one string
Oh, just a simple button combination?
that's my kind of ui :D
make it the konami code :P
lol Oh yeahhhh
What exactly are you looking for? :P
If you're talking programming abilities, I can only create functions, if statements, couts, cins
I somewhat understand do while loops
what's there to get?
perform, evaluate, repeat on true, exit on false
if it's true, it loops. not much to it
D:
I hate that. It's usually simple, and I make it harder than it needs to be
for is a bit trickier
6AERO
6:>
O:
hello~
basically only want to use while when the outcome cannot be put into a range
or when you're looping on a condition
6How goes art?
Oh, I think I understand for
while ( !succeed ) { try(); }
like while (!passwordValid()) {printf("%s", "Invalid password!");}
that would just print "invalid passord" forever
that would be an infinite loop
goes good
*well
or w/e
alskdfjakl
just as much fun, though
6ovo
6Okay.
6How goes that sketch? :>
Well, as I've stated before, all the sketch requests are finished. o3o
6So...
I'm waiting for a corrected loop
I'm on the edge of my seat wondering how it's going to turn out
6Where are they? ovo
o3o
lol
s/passwordValid()/checkPass()/
I'm not going to upload them today 'cause I'm too lazy/tired too. >_>
see, passwordValid() must be a dictionary, pulling from a file or a database or something
*to
dfklasdjflkadsjf
but then, you'd need an argument to say who you're talking about
6T'morrow?
it pulls from globals
duh :P
Oh wait, he's ACTUALLY making the app now? :O
that's dumb
I'll upload sometime
soon
6Okay.
6Good night.
'cause I'm still exhausted from that plane flight and I don't really want to think right now
'night
6Hey, I was on a plane two days ago. :P
that's great O:
6And, erm, my internal clock is still off.
and another thing -- you want a pause or a lockout for a certain amount of tries
yup
well I'll upload whenever I have the motivation to
otherwise you could have a smart friend with a trick controller that brutes it
:( Awww. Oh well
'cause right now I just want to relax
while (tries < 3) { doPass(); }
and I don't want to deal with this scanner now
i could hack it into loadmii
but not hbc or bootmii
that's too iterative
i don't have the source
yeah
i prefer python :D
sorry, tpw
your login app sucks
is bootMii not public source?
nope
I guess that makes sense
neither is hbc
6Lol.
yeh
probably for the better
6I've gotten two things done two days I've returned.
still...
6Gonna complete another thing on my to-do list tomorrow. :>
they could do some modulary things
take plugins
bootMii plugins would be bitchin'
Hell yeah
/me 6wants to finish that fanfic. D:
(login app)
that would be really hard to do for bootmii though
hbc should be easier
actually, just set parental controls on it
a login app wouldn't have any value on hbc
or parental controls
fuck, take the SD card away
lawl
omg -- my devkitPro still won't work
Yeah, taking the SD Card out would probably be the easiet way
I have all these good ideas, and I can't do anything
what do you need to build the examples?
Hey
g++/gcc and what's included?
Hello!
Sup all?
yeah
pretty sure
i hooked it up to xcode :D
teh roof
Lol, you and your puns
:D
macfag?
question -- can you develop for iPhone on Linux?
not sure
(rather, non-Mac platform?)
not sure
sure do
sup
and i have all 3 operating systems, thank you very much
yw
can't develop for shit, but it's my only OS
it just so happens that my main computer is a mac (and i like it more :P)
i have another compy with linux and windows
tpw_, I like you
you seem like a good kid
and a windows vm here
lolthx
but the definition of "macfag" is not exclusive of any other software you might happen to own
(macfag)
>_<
so just that i happen to own an osx install disc automatically makes me a macfag even if i'm rms?
uhm.
no, I suppose not
not really
it took me about two hours to get my win7 install to recognize my fucking flash drive
there's nothing outrageously important I'd need it for
good
lol
...
okay?
your juudgement is appreciated
wtf. why won't this shit build.
cause it hates you
what's the error?
make 2, n/powerpc-eabi-gcc: 1: Syntax error: "(" unexpected
i can has code?
it's not the code, they're examples
can u email me teh codez?? i'm a student and i really needthem. thx
oh
I'm not doing anything
NO U CAN'T HAZ MAH CODE
D:
>:O
yelling is mean :<
well, uh
fine.
I'm sorry, tpw
lol
/me doesn't really care
to formalize my apology:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/examples/wii/
here
you can haz mah code.
Crisco: stfu, i has ops
WHUT.
O_O
just cause your twelve doesn't mean you can complain
13 kthx
sorry
(true)
hahaha
I admire his initiative, then
I'm sorry you turned 13 what a month ago?
of all the places you can end up in the world
talking to random people on the internet?
a wii development channel on IRC is probably in the top 30
i hate people irl though
see? probably top 10.
now you're only one year younger than me :D
WTF>
Crisco: 2 months
I NEED A NEW CHANNEL
where'd he go?
ok so http://gwht.wikidot.com/usb-loader which version do i get?
is there any built-in theme changer in usb loader gx?
...
cos i downloaded a theme and it's hideous, now i want the old one back
Crisco: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
(the default one)
read the topic@
technically, usb loader gx is homebrew, i'm not talking about backups
lolwat
tired gay succumbs to dix
Is there any built-in theme changer in usb loader gx?
i've done so before
i know the rules
dunno
in a year?
ask one of the other ops, i can't put you in the bot
pirate does usb loader gx work ok?
we won't help you with usbloaders
if you do it again, i'll ban you
i was told to use CFG
gx is poop
go home and watch your Disney XD
ok then im gonna continue my quest to finish USB Loader with CFG or w/e
its just a pain in the ass
i don't think so =(
it also works alot smoother
but to reiterate my original question, is there a built-in theme changer with gx?
or do i manually have to take the sd card back to the pc to delete the theme files?
iirc yes
where? can't find it =/
I don't know
alternatively does dvd-r work on wii?
I only use CFG where it's easy to change themes
crisco what version do i get of CFG?
the latest?
newer wiis have the D3-2 disc drive which doesn't read burnt cds
I haven't used my wii for a while
The v57b7-222 .dol?
I only play it when friends are over or when I get a new game
I guess
ok so once i put hermes on 236 and all that shit and i goto burn on dvd-r can i just use GX loader to load it?
ah, found a fix on the forums "is there any built-in theme changer in usb loader gx?"
oops wrong ctrl v
or what do i need to do once i put the disc in will it autplay?
"Change the theme path in the settings to one of the folders that contains a theme"
or i just play the dvd-r like any other
as if i rented a game
lawl
new wiis doesn't read dvd-rs
3 strong supports and a support
LU39725
is the beg of my serial
is that old enuf?
Hi
You're a strong support.
ill try it and see what happens
now, does it need to load from SD everytime i wanna play a game?
/me cries
or once the mod is done i can just play fromthe dvdr with no sd card
2o.o
/me eats it
n.n
I'm 3/4 strong supports
/me hms
NOU
and if you install usbloader gx as a channel you don't need an sd card, but you'll have no place to store covers
i installed as a channel
me too
vs cfg that u can put on the hdd
but i can inst both right?
yes
gonna go eat O:
/me eats it
ok cuz im tryin to inst cfg too
which is the latest version?
/me doesn't know what's going on
b57b7
Of course!!
i bleave
He's a strong support, clearly.
ok
he v57b7.dol which loads IOS249 first can be downloaded directly from here.
The v57b7-222 .dol
which one of these?
:o
u need to install it first
then upgrade
Hi where!
/me doesn't know where :o
I feel like throwing up
He is from #ElderScrolls
ok so what version do i get
u need a clean install version
eww

/me may or may not be in your closet, stealing your wireless intertubes
:o
/me pokes #epic-chat
!rules
my wireless is firmly sealed shut
Gais. Guess what I just got for Epic-Chat. c:
/me hugs Curly
everybody is banned from my wireless save for three computers and my wii ^^
What
ok that file is going
/me huggles
heya

just takin awhile
Oh wait brb.

lol
kinky
you're a server!
:D
i should make a script that goes /me applauds X whenever somebody types !rules LOL
/me is hard
cuz i had to fuck with my router settings to do the online mod way
ok so u can be urself shadow but i cant say shit like that?
A C***S**** server
wtf man is it cuz im white?
OKAY
I have given Epic-Chat..An IdleRPG room!
:O!!
yes
#IdleRPG
yep
i knew it
white man cant hack
hahaha
racist man
wow
get your cracker self going
oh wait
i know
Whats that
Almost seems like a person
no password?
im movin it
im smokin a cig tho
I'll tell you what, most if it is common sense for any help channel. When you've been on IRC as long as I have at least.. :P
and it has 1 minute remaning
I figured I'd start there anyways because it IS my first time here. :)
until the long_ass_filename_is done
honkey boy
lol yeah
haha
What do I do
soooo many people dont read the rules that i want to hug those who do O_O
/me points and laughs at the honkey
/me just get the homebrew channel loaded, and was in the process of loading the HomeBrew Browser, but it crashed..
Curly: Why put a password?
FAQ says to reboot, but that means I need to get up. :)
/me steals it
I need a spanner wrench
thanks
you can reboot from the wiimote
um
power button xP
to password lock your idle account?
but yeah, homebrew browser crashses a LOT and its not your fault....but you do have to live with it :/
So I continued reading the FAQ, and saw there was an IRC channel, so I thought I'd check it out..
?
Curly: Look at the topic.
Apparently the Wiimote's power button is disengaged w/ a code dump on screen. :)
oooooh
woops
I used part of my class name as the password xD
so thaat's what happened
oh yeah
code dump = reset button
xP
Literally started delving into this a few minutes ago, and I thought I couldn't go wrong with extra chat support. At least for now however, nothing to ask. Printed materials online seem to be sufficent.
Can't have spaces in your class, I think.
hokay, off for real this time
yeah. most people dont even try to read before they start asking xP
/me pats the server and hugs everyone
bye where
I just did it :3
Thats awesome!
buh bai where
I think once I get into HBB I'll be looking for recommendations. I mean, I did it (hacked the wii) but I really don't know where to go from here... so I'll be reading/learning over the next few days I imagine. :)
hehe yeah
I like her
hbb is awesome..............when it works
Unless where is a guy, and then, I dunno
Yea, I hate people who refuse to RTFM, or some derivative of that..
but thats a HUGE when
Its a guy
well, he said "his"...
so I assume he was joking >.>
He was
shit
Lol
/me turns on some music, and give HBB another whirl. :)
my battery died
/me pats Proto
ja. often itll work upon restart for some unknown reason XD
Why can I not do this >D
/me breaks the lego gun
don't
touch
me
/me rebuilds it and shoots Proto
or however you spell that
/me lights it on fire
or any ice pokemon >.>
but
omnistar iirc
it finished lol
/me pats her omnistar from waaaaay back in pokemon yellow
:O
He bullied shaymin off the network twice now!
I have had to sign Shaymin up for COUNSELING!
>:(
/me unplugs shaymin
/me smacks Proto
/me explodes
Good. D<
/me holds Felix and rubs his tummy like a guitar
What am I doing wrong?!
with what?
.. /msg IdleRPG register Core pass idler
that should be right
Yeah.
THIS.
IS.
ok so i extracted that
um... I have no idea why that wouldn't work >.>
MADDENING.
why didnt u have the chrarger?
/msg idlerpg register Hero <pass> innocent bystander
that's exactly what I put in
well
minus the password
battery?
Restoring this computer is going to take FOREVER
Argh
Oh my
I missed quite a bit
Yes
Okay I c/p'd and variabed what you did Curly
I was listening to, and trying to learn Right Where It Belongs by NIN

um...
hahaha
my cat's name is Felix >..
Oh
I forgot
12oww
AND I HAVE TO RESTORE THE SETTINGS FOR ALL THEM
That makes a lot more sense now
hum
/me wants a bellyrub
are you friends with Where by any chance? :o
/me sits on Proto
because I remember someone on cs talking about their friend Felix
/me stands up under a fan
/me gives up
someone on what?
another network
bbl
then no
expect to see this housands of times today
since I only go to a few
and none start with a c
12o-o
Hey Proto
/me keeps an eye out for mosquitos landing on her shoulders
D:
Mosquitos are evil
this isn't so bad though
/me sets up an air defense system for #epic-chat
in Keremeos if you stood still on a non windy day for 10 seconds like a dozen mosquitos would come at you >_>
and some of them actually /stung/
which was weird
yeah, I've been a few places like that
hmm, not were they actually stung though
they weren't actually stinging
but their bites hurt
do the stings itch like the bites do?
ah
it feels like a sting
sharp and painful >.>
heh
florida! humidity!
and like a dozen would come at you at the same time <_<
and I don't think the stinging ones itched
probably because they didn't bother injecting you with anything to stop the pain
What was the mibbit link syntax?
Well at least it doesn't nag at you then like it does when it itches
there were lots of non stingy ones up there too >.>
some of the mosquito bites swelled up like crazy
generally the ones rubbing against my clothes
the ones at my ankles and the ones under/near my bra strap were the worst >_>
I hate ankle bites
my socks only make the itching worse
I think ankle biter was slang for small child in Australian...
/random
04hi
it's a cute idea though :3
lol, did not know that
/me noms on the nearest person's ankle and does not let go
ow
I's got a curleh on my ankle D:

Is anyone using Firefox 4?
nah, I liked it long before I met him
yeah
Me too
Still
interesting coincidence though, I must admit
HBB is annoying as heck
I'm just about to download it
I put it on the card
Loaded it

And it died horrifically and I needed to press reset to fix
Tried to remove it and it did the same thing
/me curls into a ball and rolls around the room

Too glassy for me (I'm running Windows 7)

/me is ready for bed

That's one of the reasons I still run XP, the Aero thing really bugs me
There isn't an easy way to mod XP style back in

my desktop has a 1.5TB
terabyte drive and I got 3/4 filled
Lucky
1TB for linux, 500GB for windows
and guess what? it's DUAL PROCESSOR (yeah, doesn't make sense to me either)
1.5s are about the cost of 1s now
Mine's single hyperthreaded
I have like 37 gb left on both my partitions
it was only 20 bucks more
So it's basically dual
At least that's what my system thinks
nono, the hard drive is dual processor
OH
I have no clue
it's also only 5400RPM, which is gay for a desktop drive
need at least 72
it's 'green' and shit
:P
screw green, PCs in general aren't green
duhhh
I'll make a desktop next summer
suck up energy, cost a lot to make, ruin the environment
might as well make it efficient for the end user
and then I'll game on it
hmm
new cfgloader
Speaking of which, I need a RAM upgrade for my desktop
good old fashioned games

At least, emulated 486s
wow u finaly relized
My dad used to sell ataris, and not the game systems
what almost a moth later
o
ignore that
i've coded for the NES
it's pretty cool
haha
jun12th-july9th
nice
I can't code for crap
booo :P
All I know is a few basic BASIC commands
havent touched my wii in about that long
:P
learn Python
http://docs.python.org/tutorial/
Python, LISP, lua, and Perl all sound so godly
I think I've got that bookmarked
python is godlier
:P
lisp LOOKS godlier
lua is most-used in my circles
lua's weird imo
i only used it to write some script for an emulator
Most of my potential work involves coding with the Source engine and some THQ games I still muck around with
me either
which only uses lua coding
unless there's a python compiler for the wii I probably won't learn it
/cs set flood lines:time I think
#channel name in there somewhere
ummm
um
it's not
that's
python isn't compiled
ooh cool, source engine
what
it's interpreted
okay
well I obviously have no idea what I'm talking about
I knew it was wrong >_>
I've never compiled code before so pardon my stupidity
i want to get garry's mod except a) it costs money and b) parents won't let me get it
Yes :3
/mode #channel +f <# of line>:<per seconds>
Executed code maybe
yes it does
Knew it.
Gmod is $5 and the best purchase you will ever make
so...
:O Why won't they let you get it?
5 lines per 8 seconds would be like
/mode #channel +f 5:8
compiled is where the desired code is compiled from a higher language down to the machine language for the target, for example, C
i want to get it with tf2 so i have shit to play with
Things to ponder: "When sign makers go on strike is there anything written on their signs?"
haha
http://wiki.inspircd.org/1.1/Channel_Modes <-- useful :O
ah
TF2 modding is done in lua too
what else is new and good
hi
app wise
Heck you can mod any source game by hacking together some lua code
wiimc
wii explorer
Curly Thanks:)
Harley_Davidson_Road_Trip_USA_WII-ZRY
whats wiimc?
interpreted is where a separate program, usually written in a compiled language, reads either a) some form of bytecode (example: java) or b) the source directly (example: certain BASIC dialects) and then ran in a VM by the interpreter
wii media center
hmm
play vide ect over network share and locally
sure, once I actually have some money
neat
if i could get the money to you, i would
oh
All you need is a paypal account
network share?
Or a prepaid card
but i think giving money to some random person on the internet would go over about as well as asking for it directly
smb
for windows networking via ip
Just buy a $10 prepaid from Walmart
how do i get money into the paypal account?
?
need a checking account
ohh
i dont understand smb or any of that
see, i'm 13, so i probably can't get a paypal account or fill it with money
hehe
actually
then u dont need to mess with it :)
wells fargo has teen checking
Yea, that's how I roll. If I don't know about it then I dont take the risk
Teen checking? Never heard of that
I'm using it actually
oh man
i wonder if i'm the oldest person here
They give you a debit/ATM
i think i'll badger my parents more and see if i can get it without having to get it as a gift
i'm 26
0_0
Who here is younger than 19?
me!
Me
Me
but my parents are assholes about ratings :/
lol
My mom and dad don't seem to care
It's cool, just get them to buy you a $10 prepaid
:O!
Weird, though
i was first!
LOL
tpw, how is it that you're allowed to come to a Wii hacking forum, but not allowed to get certain games? :P
and the annoying thing is that they let me play it at friends' houses
here?
they kinda don't know
they only know i'm in one channel on a different network
never really told them iirc
so he isnt
sux2bh
but they're basically "yeah, yeah that's great now come to dinner"
:P
yerp
lol, mine don't even know about my "internet life"
lol
whats the point of liveing if u dont push it a lil
LOL FCHAN BLORL
They only know that I run unsigned code on the Wii, and that if I brick, that's my fault
hah
my wii is mine
nobody else touches it
funny
your parents know what unsigned code is
lol, not at all
no, they have no idea of the extent of my presence on the internet :P
:P
false alarm

Apparently they somehow stumbled upon a website that lets them watch movies online

/me added to Curly's time on idlerpg. :)
they googled netflix o_O
And I'm thinking -_-
my family only knows 99% of online things because of me
lol
It was some pirate site, apparently. -_-
the really fucking annoying thing is i accidentally introduced them to lolcats
dude i love lolcats! :D
D:
But I don't think they're doing that again.
they don't know/don't care about the gigabytes of illegal shows i torrent
:P

A minute..AND A HALF
wally swap?

yup

yeah
and sometimes they're inappropriate, so i'm like "oh, god"
http://media.peopleofwalmart.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/1536Mizz.jpg
people send me xkcd things sometimes....ive seen 95% of the good ones on that site XD
caption
Does anybody have any beanbags? Im really in the mood to play some cornhole.
ha ha
inappropriate lolcats...where?!
ewww, inappropriate lolcats
a) yes and b) their sibling sites
they found those too
like failblog
I hope they didn't find 4chan
nope
also, what really pisses me off is when i show them something funny then all of a sudden it's the center of attention for the rest of the year and they annoy the hell out of me with it
people are over-rated
lol
OMG EVIL!
From time to time, my parents will show me something that I already know how to do
-_-
hahaha
Believe it or not, my mom used to be the technically savvy one
That's what you get for challenging me. :)
my dad did too
i really don't believe it
then he started getting lazy and just bothered me when he had trouble
:P
Yeah, I pretty much handle anything that goes wrong -- tech-wise, anyway
I was just minding my own business and I /tripped/ into you D:
My dad's the tech-savvy guy
/me runs away in tears
Inspired me to become one
Now everyone comes to me for tech support when they cba to bother him
don't make curleh cry D:
:P
/me thinks kitties are too lazy :P
I've blown up a good many PCs in my dad
day
One of my mom's friends wanted me to set up her router
It wasn't hard... all she had to do was follow the instructions
you can't let anyone know you know about technology
NEVER
But she didn't know what the modem was...
hehe
-_-
normies thing technology is ARCANE BLACK MAGIC
if you let them know you can do it
they'll never stop bugging you
If anyone asks you what a CD is
Say "is that what they use to diagnose you for brain tumors"
"hey... essex... how do i GOOOGOL something?"
xkcd agrees :P
lol
the problem is people tend to piss me off
What? With simple stuff?
no no no, in general
i'm NOT a people person
:P
You like to sit and code, huh? :3
yup
computers don't say no :D
I'm a people person
When "people" means "people who know what they're doing in vB"
peer is a jerk
lol
i think you closed your client by mistake
i just got a standard quit
http://www.peopleofwalmart.com/?p=14930 hot
Yeah, I'm actually a people person
But when I try to bring my knowledge into a conversation, they're all... "lolwut"
i hate crowds
whats the shortcut to connect to a server?
And it's saddening, because noone else shares the knowledge that I do
i hate people who are stupid (pretty much everybody in my mind)
..
:D
/me emocorners.
sweet, thanks
:P I guess that's why I've stuck with the Wii scene for awhile
*for so long
lol
i also have aspergers, defined by wikipedia as "Asperger syndrome or Asperger's syndrome is an autism spectrum disorder that is characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests."
so when it's hard to communicate with people, they just annoy you :P
do you OFFICIALLY have aspergers?
or are you self diagnosed?
probably selfdiagnosed
or parentally diagnosed
a psyciatrist said so, so i would say so
I was professionally diagnosed with aspergers but apparently I've "grown out of it"
I thought I heard my mom
D:
i think i have a touch of aspergers
I like to think I was just a little jerk when I was little
so you kicked out your power cable?
No, I closed my laptop
i think if you really have aspergers you just dont understand sarcasm
i'm kinda bad at that
I think I should change the setting so that it doens't sleep
Table dances are $20, lap dances are $30, and a backbreaker off the top rope is gonna run you $50.
http://media.peopleofwalmart.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/1441.jpg
*doesn't
And I'm bad at detecting textual sarcasm
the only guy i ever know with aspergers could NOT get sarcasm
I had a channel named the #emocorner once >.>
i use sarcasm a lot in everyday life
other than that a lot of people who are self diagnosed aspergers are just assholes or are not good socially
my parents get annoyed though cause i use it to insult people
I never use sarcasm
Evetr
:o
ever
lol
like me
noooooooooooooo
Curly:
i don't have aspergers
I'm the most non-sarcastic person in the world
i'm just an asshole
We has a better tutorial!
well asperger's is kinda defined as not good socially xP

LOLO
Yes.
lol
it's weird to think about when i upgraded to 4mb of ram on my pc
te-he
oh
it was an awesome amount of ram
4mb? i remember the old 512kb ram dos days
I choose destruction
*lolwut*
my uncle donald used to work on 4k machines
8mb extended ram OMG OMG OMG
4k
lol
2 was system
2 was program
I mean
One was used for storage
One was used for basically RAM
nowadays, 4mb would not load a linux terminal
i have 4gb on my laptop
yes it would
4MB will load a really scaled down linux terminal if you work hard and cross your fingers
Weird, I just got d/c'd for no apparent reason
my ds has 4MB
thats 1000x the ram
it can run vi
Yeah, I'm on my neighbors internet
and ssh
:3
lol
yeah ive got 4gb on my laptop too
don't move too far
My mom puts our internet on standby at night
that's crazy!
D:
i only have 2gb, the max it'll go :<
>:C
I put your mom on standby at night
3gb ram.
my mind stops working when i try to comprehend it
not to mention kids cant relate
!rules
wtf

People are getting d/c'd

Felix really is a little monster >.>
3 feet long from nose to tippy tail
he's stretched out upstairs like a furry hot dog <3
haha
XD
:O
picture
hmm
/me measures Shane
/me grabs a camera and checks
wb
Three feet exactly including the tail :3
your connection hates you donest it? o3o
I have no pets
:(
when he fully stretches out his front legs he's a meter long
gtg
bai pplz~
/me got some photos of him stretched out with a meter stick beside him :O
:o
:D
he's so nice to sit still like that <3
I think it's too hot for him to move around much >.>
/me can haz Tifa?
It was 104F outside today
Or
40 C
Broke the 100F barrier and grazed past the 40C barrier
...Whoa the time. XD
It was like 120 F / 50 C in my car though :x
Greenhouse effect ftl
we almost broke our heat record today
32C
hottest it's ever been in Vancouver is 34C
/me thinks we broke the heat record for Vancouver here
well that wouldn't be surprising :p
100F is 40C
And 120 F is 50 C :D
oh, my foot is in that one
Hehe

Cupcake is 34"
But she would never stay still that long.
Felix is awesome at staying still
he cuddles with me when I go to bed <3
Pff.
Cupcake will jump off my bed.
And I have a bunk bed.
well
that's not so hard for a kitty
Felix can jump an 8 foot fence. he has nothing on the neighbour cat though
that thing can wall run up to high places >.>
more like wall bounce
I know, but it's just the whole principle that I'm so uninteresting that she's willing to jump from my bed. XD

NONE :(
wow...
you people said more last night than my backlog handles
too lazy to look into the real logs
tired
you highlited me
oh, sorry
i did follow the softmod guide for a black 4.2u wii
shall i also do the Hermes cIOS?
we dont support "black" wii's here
:)
ok, it was brown
next i think i need to replace the dvd
if you know a good place for dvd that would be great...
or shall i just use a modchip? not sure....!
if r u softmodding why would u wan to tinker with the dvd drive?
wii's dont come in brown
u realy want me to say it?
we dont support "ni¶¶3r" wii's here
oh yes you are right
so i think i have to replace the dvd
its a hardware thign tht cant be changed
only thign to do is replace the dvdrom drive
but why?
there are replacement-boards on ebay
just get a usb hdd
for the dvd
and run all your wii games off it
You guys know a place selling dvds...?
swap out the board for a board with all three chips
fuck replacing
I swapped the board on mine
from an old bricked wii
:D
yes, but for GC games, until they release the GC Loader, the only way is through dvd-rs...
no problem at all... just some soldering required. piece of cake :D
thats why i wanted to replace the dvd
:D
fuck that
just get a gc and chip it
vipdergc's r only like 45 bux
/me has two chipped gc as well :D
i have gc and it is already chipped with viper 1.0
/me too
qoob on mine
update it
:D
Sup Shadow =)
latest is um 2.6 o think
but it would be great to play gc backups on the wii also
Good to see you =)
no it wont
viper did not release an updated FW, or did they?
gc backups on wii are not working well... I've got strange framebufferbugs and shit.
most games are 100%... but many are fucked yp
Cobra BIOS v2.1

oh....ok
cobra21.vgc file
there was a programmer...right?
that flat cable is still there in my GC
well thats for inital flashing
is your printer port or usb?
oh alright
i think it was usb, i have to dbl chk
http://www.dextrose-forum.com/ << what happened to this place? any1 got an offline backup?
its been gone for years
well
what u looking for?
dextrose.com was changed to dextrose-forum
it was there like 6 months ago
not sure what happened
i used to participate in that forum in late 90s, and i would like to save all the info about the N64
also
i dont want us to loose Lac,titanik, redbox, crowtrobo, and redbox great work...
? list
um ok
that made no scence to me
? softmod
or basicly anyone here for that matter
i agree
so, is the Hermes cIOS important?
only a few games use it
when laoding via usb
oh ok

If I want to use a fowarder for CFG loader, which should I use?
I use (Universal) Forwarder Channel: (by Narolez)
there are a few listed in the release thread of CFGLoader
Yeah, I saw that... I figured I would ask who had some experience witht hem
Do you like the universal fowarder channel?
bbl o//
it's what I use
I haven't tried any of them yet
if I switch my USB HDD to FAT32, are wbfs file as small as they are on WBFS file system or are they the same size as .isos?
use wii backup manager to convert .iso to .wbfs...and yes, they're as small as on a wbfs file system
Yeah, I have all my games on a USB drive that's not FAT32... so I will have to pull them to another drive, format the USB and then convert...
going to be a process

Dell Wirelessâ¢ 1501 802.11b/g/n Half Mini Card [Included in Price]
	 Dell Wirelessâ¢ 1520 802.11a/g/n Draft Mini Card [add $15.00]
um, wrong window
lol
so far this Dell looks like a bad deal
to get even *close* to my MSI it's almost at $2000
compared to the $1400 or so mine cost
I'm just bored LOL
and my boss handed me a brand new Dell Latitude and asked me to install software
has an i7 and 4GB RAM, so I thought "This is pretty decent" - that was, until I saw how much these suckers cost
http://img706.imageshack.us/img706/8964/36673330.png <-- Fail
so failed
lmao
my MSI was $1700
just, mine has a Core 2 Quad and not an i7 :/
jesus
whatever, same diff I suppose
actually there is a significant performance increase from C2Q to Ci7
hm
not really worth $300 though
plus my C2Q is 2.24GHz, that's I believe 2.37
the i7
no, 2.67
which is nice
03o.o
mine was only Â£30-40 above the C2Q I was considering
and it oc'd nicely to 4GHz with a watercooler
:o
/me cough
is it a laptop though?
o.o
need to look better for an offer with an i7 if you're being charged $300 more for it
I know
I was just seeing how much Dell charged
as the Latitude seems like a better laptop than some of their cheapie ones
but it costs a ton as well as I showed
(customized, that is)
well ill see yous later
now $400 of that was a Blu-Ray drive
which my laptop has
so yeah
14o.o#
take the Blu-ray drive out and get one yourself for like Â£70, maybe less now
for a laptop?
I've seen desktop BDs, not laptop sold separately
03iyfud
http://www.callaccessories.com/product_info.php?language=en&currency=GBP&products_id=5504 found that on the first page of google shopping results for laptop blu-ray drive
/me hi
interesting
most for laptop were Â£140-170, but that's still cheaper than what you were being offered
Fffff
Hey

is there a read me file or something somebody can send me that explains the rules for the site?

thats the only rule
we dotn host files here
so what do you guys do here?
Help people with modded wii's
sweet
here anything about a 4.3 fix yet?
i've hacked two wii's so far
the tutorials are getting much better
finally figured out that my hard drive going to sleep was crashing my wii
luckily i had a maxtor
so I was able to use the seagate tools
to make it so it doesn;t sleep anymore
however I am kind of worried about how that will affect the life of the drive
07http://dawnchapel.com/2010/07/firefox-has-crashed/

anybody else have a situation like that and not have anu issues with the drive later on?
14LOL
yeah
holy cow
you got to mod the 360 for that too?
for playing extracted games yes, for using a usb drive as storage for your saves and such, no
i imagine xbox live would be banning boxes like crazy
i have a hacked regular xbox
i dont take that online at all
yeah thats why I gave up live
wow
the regular xbox was awesome for that
not sure I could do that
i am still using it every night
i run xbox media center
its an awesome media server
well you could still run xbmc
just block live access
how do you block?

5Got this art project thingymabobber to work on. ^^
huh, do i need anything other than IOS249 to run backups? it still errors on load "An error has occurred. press eject button"
you have to have the right dvd drive to run backups
new drives wont do it
i was doing it yesterday so it shoudl be ok.
I think something is wrong with my hdd.
so it was working then it quit?
uhh
It's transfer rate is getting less than 1mbps
lol
welli was trying to update my softmod[?] stuff to run mario galaxy 2
ah
so im thinking what has to be installed to run backups?
i installed IOS249 just now.
that didnt help
update ios249 to rev19 ?
6'
6everybody poofed away D:
6-clap-
yep
thats what i *just* did
5Yeah I noticed that. ><
what happens when you try to load smg2 ?
i got mario 2 to run but it was a retail copy
uhh
well now it wont run anything
what loader ?
.28 mbs wtf is happenin?
no loader.
the disc channel
6anyone ever hear of Perfect World International?
i couldnt get event he retail copy to work with the dsic channel
do i need a loader now?
I can't run backups, usb hdd only...
You need a loader retard
thanks :)
loader
5Not me. o-o
thats what i was looking for
5What is it?
that si what you need
whats a good loader?
go with cfg
6Online game
cfg
www.cfgloader.com
great loader
6It's pretty fun, takes LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG time to download though
http://gwht.wikidot.com/usb-loader
infact you'd be plain silly to go with anything else!
usb loader?
cfg is the best out there no matter what
i couldnt find a channel version of that
5Geez.
get a usb hdd
5And OMG
i dont have a usb hdd that will work.
there's forwarder channels
5MY TABLET IS WORKING WITH SAI. :DD
get one
5Finally!!!
6YAY
i got mg2 to work with neogamma
surely there must be a loader that will work in a normal channel and work with backups?
http://gbatemp.net/index.php?showtopic=147638
5I hate trying to do linearts on Photoshop; they look so much nicer on SAI. But I do all my coloring and effects in PS. ^___^
use a forwarder
6I dun have PS
every art tool is optimised towards something
6:(
how do you get it to run off the onboard flash?
even GIMP has its strong points
6I have MS paint and GIMP lol
get neogamma for that
I couldn't tell you what they are, but it has them.
/me cough
you can use usb flash drives...they are slow and limited in space
yeah cuz i dont have an sdcard i can dedicate to that.
and expensive per gb
im not worried about that since i use dvd-r
get an SD card anyway, they are like $10
ok
a good sd card is important if you want to use much homebrew
so youre saying there are nolonger any normal loaders?
2GB regular SD card
what the heck is a normal loader
anything that can install as a channel, and load dvd-r
the channels are not the loader
Neogamma, but use a forwarder channel
anybody know how to rip wii games using the black wii?
forwarder?
that way when the program updates you dont have to update the channel
doesnt that require it to run from an sdcard tho?
the loader is homebrew, the wad installs the forwarder that runs the homebrew (loader)
yes
ok im trying to find a solution that doesnt require an sdcard
good luck
pretty much
gee thanks.
they are dirt cheap and you can buy them anywhere
tehy are right next to the pack of gum
can't priiloader be set to run an installed boot.dol ?
5I've never used GIMP. ^^;
or that might be off sd still
Is there a way for me to run a diognostic check on my hdd? I'm only getting 1mbps so im worried.
5I've been using Photoshop since I started doing digital art (it's my mom's LOL. she's a photographer).
usb hdd ?
*photoshopper
?
/me hides
depends on what files you are transfering
yea
5That too.
usb 1.1 cable ?
Nope 2.0
5Sometimes she uses PS, sometimes she doesn't.
also can depend on the sector size
or, chunk...what you pick when you format
Its fat32
i know I had an issue with a drive where the driver got screwed up and it slowed down to less than a 1MB
ok..you can set up to 32kb...
16k chunk gives good performance
what drive do you havge ?
have ... ?
Seagate GO 320gb
ok neogamma works fine
is there a .wad version of neogamma u can run as a channel without an sdcard?
There ya go
Doubt it
5It's part of a project I'm doing. D
5**:D
Alex, once you can clear the drive off, format it with a larger block size
EW ADOBE

is the 2.0 cable connected to a 2.0 port ?

is there any other usb ports being used ?

5It was beautiful there. 80-90 degrees Farenheit and windy almost every day. I got lots of bug bites and some sunburn, but nothing terrible.
you might look into updating your drivers for it...reinstall
5But I bet the week of Band Camp it'll be 100 degrees every day. --;
5ALWAYS HAPPENS.
6Lol 4 straight days of 90+ degree weather, humidity 4000%, no wind, UGH
5At least it's my last band camp everrr~ 8DDD
6ok back to PWI
see if you can install a game on the wii...if it is slow also
5LOOOOL, humidity 4000% would be like a major downpour. xD
Lol, what's band camp?
5Band Camp is.. the week of hell for marching band students.
you haven't gone and updated firmware have you ?
http://gbatemp.net/index.php?showtopic=159099 that works fine and is in a channel yay
Ahh, that kind of band.
5Five days of intense marching practice, lots of drilling, and basically learning half the show in a week.
<3 gbatemp
it's also a place where girls can have inapropriate fun with flutes
I mean
that.
5All on a blisteringly hot football field.
runs from usb:\\ ?
you guys use a real football field?
how can humidity exceed 100%?
no
5You even get astroturf tire pieces in your shoes. YAY.
runs from a channel.
we always just used grass LOLL
-L
5Yup, we practice on the school's field.
oh that sucks
band camp at school? Boo
5It's not actually a camp; we go home every night.
we actually stayed there for 5 days
odd
it was a hotel like thing too
5Lucky.
with air conditioning
it was cool
5D:
5RICH SCHOOOOOOOL.
just kinda boring marching like 7-8 hours a day
not really
we had to pay for it
not the school :P
5Yay for inner-city-brokeness.
6Lol Im not in marching band.... YET
it was like $100 a person
5If people had to pay for band camp, no one would be in band.
as a freshman
LOL
we
5We'd have a band of 20 instead of 120.
we're in band because we want to be
well I'm not anymore as I graduated
6THAT IS MY REAL LIFE NAME DRF lol
but you get the ideda
*idea
:P
and you're the same age as her too
I think
6I hope I'm not you sister
oh, that's nice... I guess... but how will updates work ?
she just finished 8th grade
6O.O
who cares?
6I DID TOO
5o-o
Do you have a brother who's in college? :P
I suspect you'
6no.....
d know
OK
5OH LOL.
then you're not my sister
;P
6darn
5Thatt would've been crazy.
5**That
my sister's kinda dumb anyway
she likes Hannah Montana -_-
6lol
6EW
5EW.
and HSM, and all that crap
5EW.
6EWEWEWEWEWEW
what region is it ?
5HSM IS AN INSULT TO REAL BROADWAY.
5><;;;;;;;;;;;;
LOL
6She like Justin Bieber?
she's indifferent
like "I don't hate himb ut I don't l;ove him either"
all?
6I hate anything associated with Disney
ohhb
i dont know.
well
14Sky! :3
Disney was fine until like 1995ish
it runs on my usa wii tho.
their older animated movies were awesome
Aladdin FTW
/me huggles
6and I was born in 1996... I'm in the crap-era of disney
/me huggles back
region free...
yep
at least you realize it
my sister's just like "YAY DISNEY CHANNEL"
Hm, the other day someone told me that 1337% of pi is 42.
that's R4, over a year old...you might eventually run into bugs and games that are incompatible
My mind was blown. XD
is it really?
@calc 3.14*13.37
= 41.9818
oh wow
too bad
but atleast it works eh.
Lol I'm via iPad...
http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&rlz=1C1GPEA_enGB314GB314&q=1337%25+of+pi&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=
EW APPLE
It's interesting that mibbit works
Lolz
good, now go play some Flash games
03o.o
Oh that's right
you can't.
What's wrong with apples? They taste good. :(
Flash games are failure anyways loll
I thought you didn't like Adobe, drf? :P
I don't
Flash was Macromedia
Adobe just bought them
Yup
So flash is Adobe.
So await apple to standardize html5 in browsers and websites
They have done quite a few major sites already
hi
Apple can't standardize anything besides how to steal your money.
It looks like R8 is latest
They never stole mine, they tried to give me the best deal possible
That's because you worked for them >_>
03ih :3
At least when I go to their store people are always smiling, awaiting hand a foot live servants
Like
if my ext hd that holds only my wii backups is showing up as raw is there anyway to partition it with a fat32 drive as well without losing the games?
yeah, they smile, but they're idiots
like
I went there one time
tried to buy something in iTunes on an ipad
asked them how to cancel it
they were like "Um, can you?"
Here in Canada it is different
I was like "Can you?"
they were like "I don't think so"
I was like "... you really can't cancel a download?"
You can't
"Nope."
It's standard and law
So i was like
im trying to make a partition dont know what the best way would be any help would be appreciated
now I have to wait 48 hours
for their lame excuse for Wi-Fi
to download this 3GB file
and I was like, can you fix this pleaseS?
they were like um, I don't know how
Hahaha
I was like, real genius tehre
I tried renting a movie on iPad
to see what the quality looked like
I did and it was awesome
it told me 48 hours left
and Iw as like f this
but I couldn't cancel it
nor get my money back
Yea a 48 hour limit
so yeah, the people at the Apple store grin away but can't actually help you
........
Like renting a movie in store
I MEAN THE TIME IT TAKES TO DOWNLOAD
THAT'S HOW SLOW THE INTERNET WAS
Don't need to yell
Lol
still
every time I've gone in there the people who work there can't help
Still, you don't understand the company like I do
like sometimes I'll just go to check my email and/or troll their computers
and I can't even get 5 minutes of peace without them going "You sure you don't want to buy anything?"
is it broken?
and I'm like "NO I DON'T THANK YOU"
In this case you really don't know why you go through what you do
viince: if you think thats cool , there used to be a program dealy to make the disc channel play backups too.
You need to know the terms
...
what?
I just buy parts and whatnot
I built my own computer
you can't build a Mac
no im just following a guide on how to add rb and the dlc i have to the hdd instead of the sd card since it doesnt hold many
As did I
Then it was stolen
and whose fault is that
keep your house locked
This is e most portable piece of technology for what I do
and it requires i have a fat32 section on my hd
I'm a pokemon USA representative
proly have to copy them somewhere
I mostly email and browse their site
orly?
And order
a format is usually destructive
I thought you worked for a website comapny
*company
Yes
I can create events
so i need to backup my games or just put them back on from my actual copies?
mebbie partition magic can help
I have a league and tournaments hosted, and I deliver supplies to stores
but you don't actually work for PokÃ©mon USA, do you?
I do
Under organized play
what
For the Vancouver region
oh
so you can't get like, exclusive stuff?
like movies and whatnot?
I use a WODE so it's NTFS all the way...
I can
can you get PokÃ©mon movies in HD?
To show it off, not to sell before the time
but if you have the games them it might be easier to put them back on after the format
I got 2 and 3 from Apple TV, which cost me a fricking fortune
and it didn't even work right
well i have a ext 500 gig passport i believe it is
which is again Apple's fault
I said organized play only
oh
rather than mess about
that doesn't help then
no free agent go
I need audio/video material :P
depends how much you value your time
i know
And I just need a proper system that is lit weight and portable
Lint
and how many gamea are on it
well if i format the drive i can choosehow much lets say for fat32 and it will leave the rest in wbfs format?
10Hey Chumera
Light*
LOL fail
have you seen the Lenovo U1 Hybrid?
6lol
proly not
That thing's like 50x better than the iPad
fricken autocorrect, I will turn it off
I don't want lento
does wiiflow still work with fat32?
Lenovo
should right
ni
Skldjfghsfdjkhsfdnj
how come?
is that a no
its a no idea
ahh sorry
Because I don't want any system like that
It's plastic
:D
I hate computers using plastic as a shell
WODE just works
Annoying because it will be replaced sooner
i dont know what tthat is
...what?
google it....
its genius
i will ( :
the U1 Hybrid is a tablet, like the iPad, but it has a base that you can snap it into with a real processor that turns it into a netbook
The lenovo doesn't have 3G built in for roaming and emailing
:P
03o.o
I don't need any of that though
I just want this for my work
I don't wanna beat around what I need to do
and what do you think plastic would be replaced with, then?
WODE takes 10 minutes to fit... you them plug in an NTFS HDD ( mines a ITG Hitachi) and it rips the original games straight to it
14>> 4WinAmp 14<> 12Pokémon 14<> 3Pokémon Heroes Soundtrack - no year 14<> 7no title 14<<
This I can just click, slide and it's ready 24 hours a day
14lol
or you can use 'baxkups' you find on the Interweb
14Incomplete downloads fail XD
assuming you have an Internet connection of course
;D
I don't want the hassle of restarting a product , that way it's useless
the main waste of plastics is in packaging, then lego. Plastic casings are going to carry on a long way yet
invisible to the firmware too
Apple uses small packaging
Works for me
5 /sooooooooooo lost
Less waste and it's recycled material
so no 'an update bricked my jacked Wii help!'
currently at least
it's not actually out yet
but I believe it will come with 3G
Exactly
It's not out yet
My point stands clear
with my luck I'll find a Wii game worth playing just as Nintendo block it
well I know HP has tablet computers
that ARE out
that have keyboards and everything
and you can fold the screen down and use it as only touchscreen
This was available earlier
Screw hp
um, no?
see
Bad bad company
the tablet computer has been out for ages
you're every bit as brandname biased as I am
I just don't like Apple
you don't like HP, whatever
I don't particularly love HP either but they're a lot better than Apple.
hey uh
is there anyone worse than apple?
14Heya Quil
I'm not gonna be on anywhere else for a little, I need to set up my new computer
HP has nothing but problems lately, overheating being a major, exploding batteries and catching fire
14k
Satan maybe?
I'm not sure...
and you didn't hear about the guy's iPhone that had its battery explode?
Only because he messed with it
Apple have had problems with exploding batteries for years
I really don't like big brands at all, whether HP, Dell, Sony, etc
hence why I built my own
but if I had to choose between something like Dell or HP and Apple, I'd go with Dell or HP any day
Hence why this conversation is over
Dell is worse uhg
money-wise, sure
but they have decent stuff if you don't mind paying too much
(again, same with Apple)
thousands of iPods have exploded over the years, Apple just gives the victims a free replacement and some monies and the press doesn't hear
Iv had nothing but parts dieting and replacements, then customer service to even replace anything
Dieing
I don't like major hassle companies
I don't like major companies, period
Apple included
Face it, the iPad was just there when I needed it for work, the others weren't
what?
tablet PCs have been around forever
like at least 2 years
the iPad is -late- to the scene
longer than that
I hate tablet pcs
I don't need anything overpowered
Vista launched with support for them and there was extensions for XP before that
I just browse pokemon.com, email, and order
LOL overpowered
that's what users like me would call *powerful*
though 7 is the only one to do it well
Anyways discussion is over
I don't need a tablet for the work I di
Do
I need somthing light and portable and doesn't overheat ever
an Android phone?
/me hides
This always stays cold
I don't need a phone either
I like android, but on the current models it's on, there is no chance of me getting one yet
I have the Motorola Droid
I wait
and since I have Verizon that worked out fine
/me randomly hugs Sky :3
SKYLANDS :3
I've never used one for more than 2 minujtes
-j
it overheats quite easily from stories
such as one guy who used it to conduct a wedding, and it overheated in the middle of the ceremony
wouldn't surprise me
...
people conducting weddings with iPads, LAME
like "PLEASE COOL ME DOWN ELSE I WON'T LET YOU DO ANYTHING" "I can frigging HOLD you just fine so I don't see how you can think it's too hot >:|"
XD
yeah, Apple has been behind the times since like the 80s
they were good back in the days of the //e and whatnot
but ever sicne I've been alive Windows has had the upper hand
10:O
6meow
6meow
5But everyone these days seems to think Macintosh is the best. All the kids at my school, anyways.
5They're addicted to their iPod Touches and Apps and stuff.
yeah
I did have an article that pretty much dated the emergence of the tablet, and guess what? it came out of MS.
iPods are just stupid
LOL
well the other thing I like about Microsoft
they don't try to make their own hardware
/me now belongs to Skylands for 1 minute
I cant set a limit
/me now belongs to Skylands for 7 minutes
/me now belongs to Skylands for 3 minutes
they leave that to people who actually know how to do it
like Intel
try and fail
*cough*
XD
still
there's no such thing as a "Microsoft built computer"
you'll have parts from other places
Apple, on the other hand, just brands everything - both hardware and software, as theirs
anything hardware MS do is conceptual, they give it to people who can do it to actually do it
5All my friends that have Macs are all, "But Macs (even though they're more expensive) last way longer than PCs and never have ANY VIRUSES or ANY PROBLEMS and blah blah blah..."
yep
LOL RP4L, yeah, but you'd be surprised
04o-o
What's a tag? :o
5Is it true that Macs can't get viruses?
makes me want to get a mac just to write a virus for it, almost
Nope.
they can quite easily, there just aren't any (yet)
there are viruses
lemme find this pic
no, there are
just not very common
*many, then
but if you get like, pirated software
it's common to see viruses
User limit
5I think as Mac gets more and more popular they'll have more viruses and bugs.
5The problem with PC and MS is that the company pushes the makers to get stuff updated and out there /really, really fast/ and never give the producers time to work out all the bugs.
need to create a cross-platform virus so it can spread harmlessly via windows machines, hop onto linux servers, then OHMNOMNOM all the macs

14Not a very good serialkiller then
/me runs more

when you partition you hdd part to fat32 and the other left as raw do you then format the raw to wbfs?
14I is free!
12LOL
14:D
And no, not the best, but if I serial killed the whole time I was awake I would need to move from town to town every week for population density sake ;p
or is the other partion formated to ntfs before you can format it with wbfs?
14LOL
14Hmm... Cereal Floof....

Espeons though
10oh lawd, those usernames with xXxXxXnamehereXxXxXx

12and guess what
10that's so old skool

I want to crush the privates of those with such names on online games.
12Ahh

Only thing that's more annoying is iiTz <name here>

Two: If not, is credit given

12I'm sorry but an avatar.. to me is Not art theft..
12It's not been edited at all.. not been claimed as someone else's..
12It's just a picture found on the internet like everyone elses

Show the pix
but then again, she used it by uploading it onto another webspace - imageshack
this one is the dark one
http://i.imagehost.org/view/0025/DSCI0020

A 3D artist is paid a few hundred pounds over the modelling of an asset from a game, then after game is released, model is extracted and used by some noob for their own purposes. Is it justified if said artist gets annoyed that their effort is being exploited in such a way?
12I can barely see it V_____V

12Also it looks like Staravia..

is not willing these pictures are reused

i googled and got 56
or replace the dol with this http://code.google.com/p/cfg-loader/downloads/detail?name=cfg57b7.dol&can=2&q=
05D:<
ehm http://cfg-loader.googlecode.com/files/cfg57b7.dol
/me might go too
also boot.dol ofc
/me is SO angry right now

14Good for you
yes
05i just got my 9th grade school schedule and it says for my Math class, i got put in "Special Ed Department" (even though i SUCK at math :\)

which root?
its the standard
Hey

of sd card or hdd
so sexual fat 32 is nice bc i can use the hd with the pc for other files as well?
yes
k cool bc i had wbfs but i redid it to fat 32
and what should be in that dir?

cfgloader will create the necessary files in that dir
05yes, thats what it said >:|

"Ur"
10omg

10lotsa threes
then press a
02ThreesforSneas
pick my 465?
or b? dunno
or just akter your config.txt
The word "ur" makes me think of some ancient Mesopatomian city or something
02These kids are playing chess and learning Latin?!
cant be that hard :p
02Fuuu...
o.O
OK...
:P
02LATIN
like I swear there was a city called Ur in Gilgamesh
k i have it launched shows no games found should show up now when i add one?
02the Roman language o3o
02And the last one's 2 grades ahead
10lol your watching it too?
first press press till you come to the main menu
A-HA! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ur
02bet they dun know the fuu of Russian
/me hides
10the blondie has buck teeth
and press 2 to save it
02Yes I am
I'm not so crazy after all XD
press "1"
/me is no longer away : Gone for 7 minutes 51 seconds
/me is no longer away : Gone for 7 minutes 51 seconds
Hey

10yes, they're almost at the Pokemon category
/me will post all questions and answers
are the evil Oompa Loompas all gone?
02And they skip it LOL
took me 8 minutes to kill that candy ass
10lol
10now they're on farmville
02snflabflabflsbflsblan
02Ohgod these are so easy
and also update your cfg to the latest in the main menu
i got to the add a game screen and it is putting on legend of zelda
02give then 10,000 questions :O
10lol yeah
should be all set thank u very much
can anybody help me?
10can't wait for the Pokemon part
Sounds like you're someone to avoid upsetting
did you press "2" though to save your settings?
02And why farmville? These are just regular FARM questions
ha
i cannot run SNES/NES games on my wii :(
10yeah but kids relate to it more
:Ð· / :Ð / :3 / :Â³ / Ñ: / E: / :Ð­ / Ð: / :Ñ
10here's the pokemon part
Hi Trace and Zen!
last night upset me
no i didnt
too late
10...
?
!namegen
lol
hi
10i dont get it
02Wtf is this?
did yoou get revenge upon last night?
nah
well then youd have to do it next time you start cfgloader
its putting my backup on now
10lol
Do it.
no place to focus any rage upon anything
ah ok
then do it after that
i may as well punch my brother
k do what though hit 2 or 1 first
10damn no relation to Pokemno
...XD
10*Pokemon
i am sorry i saw u wrote to go in a setting
!namegen
1 is to toggle between the menus
02Yeah, because "Sword, hervavores" and whatever the hell else they said really sound like a Pokemon
or i mean save them
10it was a miscelanneous (sic) secrion
10scmitar, a dinosaur, etc.
when you are in the main menu where it says "look for updates" etc hit 2
02that was bull
2 = save
:(
apperently the angry videogame nerd has inspired him to play old nintendo games
ok
brb food
02All the other ones were insanely simple, but I was at a loss with the Pokemon section
10me too
old nintendo games are awesome
the menu as in the - sign?
and so hes playing ninja gaiden on the wii (the original one)
10twas stupid
thats what i see at the bottom of the screen
never played that game
and helped him a little and had to say wtf
heard it was ridiculously hard
the menu where you see looking for updates where its says what cios youve got etc
02bull monkeys
k
/me yawns
this is a grey color loader correct>?
people spawn continuously and sometimes hurl themselves into a pit just so you have to avoid them as you jump
O.o
ytheres also an option to download themes in the main menu
...ok...
the stock one without theme
A little weird
:P
and the respawns are rediculous
ok just want to make suree im using the right one
10lol the new categories are normal
10and these questions are so damn easy
you walk up the screen after killing several people and suddenly a football team spawns around you ready to tackle you
well the latest versions is 57b6
b7
and speaking of football team, the football guy off of super mario world is in there
XD
02I'd love to see one of these: "The war of 1812 was held in this year"
i need to play smw again
:Ð· / :Ð / :3 / :Â³ / Ñ: / E: / :Ð­ / Ð: / :Ñ
I never have played it
i loved that game when i was a kid
i was a mario kid when was young
hm

first, is there a new NeoGamma? The 1 I installed is v6 I believe, and now the newer games are making the console blink on and off while the game is in the background...or is that another problem?
your weird korean setup might be interfering with the vc/wiiwares
yes there is just google it
R8 is latest afaik
doesnt blinking mean that it wants to tell you there is an update?
can I install that without having to do the whole hack again?
you dont install appps
you just put them into the apps folder
yes
10~slang 9000
10lol forgot to change name

I can't find neogamma R8 anywhere without some malware shit popping up

/me cawfz

10lolkoolletterz

As you wish, faithful servant
Wii sports resort from cfg, goes back to system menu

:D

haha
Filthy little customer!

I just don't know how to get this game to wor
sexual u around>?
:O
/me leaves
I bet it has something to do with M+
Just kidding dear boy
04bye
here at Walmart, we treat customers better than ourselves
ha told at teh register to gift wrap my chocolate milk i bought
np
yesterday
XD
i.e. you have pal and are trying to run an ntsc game without forcing pal video mode
lololol
and he just stuck the recipt to the side of the bottle
XD
Was it a coworker?
some games won't work even though if you do this
yeah sorta
Or different shift?
But seriously they should promote me to manager of electronics
wtf
dont think they have a manager of electronics
I believe it is correct region, ripped from actual game through cfg
If I were the reincarnation of Sam Walton I would
They'd probably pay me a ton more
Hello nyte
greattttt there goes our rules bot
they only have supervisors and comanagers then the store manager
but what would you do once school starts :(
shed pay for college
oh yeah
true
/me 7blinks
hm, that's weird
Can't really be a part time manager
7That nick reminds me of the other Cynder. O3o
in another town
have you tried running the game with another loader? maybe you got a bad dump
04lol
04hey Quan
2.5 hours away
whats interesting is that a store manager can get upto almost a half/quarter million in bonus when the year's bonus comes around
I was thinking of the one near school, but OK :P
7Hey, Ly.
if it doesn't work on other loaders something may have gone wrong, try cleaning the disk and doing a new rip
oh okay
o.o
disc*
how do you know that/
*?
7Almost done with nutsy music arrangement.
supervisor told me
7Wanna see what I'm trying to arrange for a piano? :P
I thought you meant the awesome electronics department you have up there
he thought i might be interested in moving up as a career
04uh...sure?
Listen, I
O.O
am almost certain is is because of M+
He offered you a prmotion?
any way someone can please send me cios 223 v5 base 37 made in a wad?
no
aww
just showing me the ropes
I see
go fish
I think I need something
I need it in order to follow this rb2 guide to get all my dlc to play off the hd
and i guess music games in general
I definitely don't want to work there the rest of my life
cause apperently i'm one of the only people that does more than my job...
7Ah, before I send you the link: have you heard of chiptune?
and then turn alt.dol off again
04...nope
But I wouldn't mind a promotion as it would pay more
ya u will watch the wiimote proper use video and reboot
heh turn the volume down though
eh with a promotion comes crap from the [censored] hill
sexual can u please help for a min i need cios 223 v5 base 37 wad
yep
10zomg orange
10hello person
the crap rolls downhill
why v5
the only one immune to it is whoever owns Walmart
crap goes down hill and when you go up it your gona have to fight against it
in order to use uloader
v4 got better support except you use uloader
this guide i am following says to get it
hi
7Hey?
ah lo
why do you want uloader, its ugly ;p
I'd never get promoted anyway only working part time. XD
http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:FCZwAUYhnOMJ:gbatemp.net/t237966-tutorial-rockband-2-ntsc-dlc-all-songs-on-hard-drive%3Fview%3Dgetnewpost+rock+band+dlc+opn+hard+drive&cd=2&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us
its good but ugly
i dont even think the waltons own a majority of shares in walmart anymore
I mean, I'm full time now, but when school starts I won't be
yeah
ummm
ah thats why
bc i need it to point out to hd for dlc
heh
for rock band 2
you gona try for a transfer to your college grounds?
this i swhat the guide says
well just grab the cios222 v5.1 installer
any other loader allow that
I'm going to try
?
which works perfectly because the Walmart here wants all the 1st and 2nd shift people to become part time
And also apply at some other places
rockband is overrated anyways
better buy your dad's car and get a license
Anything to avoid the freaking cafeteria
the guide even links you to the cios installer
there's a bus
:P
/me 7pokes Drake back in TST.
Yay!
04I saw
owo
04and it makes absolutely no sense to me'
and avoid any of the wispering going on in the background
she'd as far in in my inner circle as you can get so she'd be the one I'd be whispering to
7Okay? Well, you know what a synthesizer sounds like, right?
...if that makes sense
nah i think im too far out there with that joke
04yes
7Have music that sounds completely synthesized.
14back
i found what i want....GBC loader for wii :D
no word yet
i thought you wanted snes ;p
just got 2 wiis here droped off to softmod and run usbloads , but they both upgraded to 4.3 aruggg
04uh...no
ffffffffffff
sexual do i need to copy cios_mload too
missed a Zergoose again :(
i realised the game i wanted didnt work on nes :p
theres a folder there
hm?
guys updated b4 they gave them to me
wtf
He said he'd decied before Tuesday
ah
or just put the reg app in the app folder
so come Tuesday I'll call is he hasn't yet
*if
wtf is a zergoose?
damn sin & punishment 2 is friggin intense
a fake pokemon in gpx+
14thanks
ah
Hmm

/me needs to get him some clicks
I want one
too bad the proxy doesn't load faster or I might have gotten it
i wana pet proxy
Ooh, BlueFlame has three new eggs to click
pet proxy?
O.o
7http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iObGdsAY160 <-- That, Lyon. :P
sexual it says i need cios 223 v5 base 37 but with the 5.1 loaded i dont see the option
7So, yeah.
can i make apps i see on Homebrew channel as regular channels?
to go where no one has gone before with total anonymaty
starts off ios 259 i went through them i dont see a cios 223
contemplating whether i should buy 2x classic controllers or 2x gc controllers
i mean 249 sorry
but i dont see it here for an option
cios 223 v5 base 37
:Ð· / :Ð / :3 / :Â³ / Ñ: / E: / :Ð­ / Ð: / :Ñ
if youd read carefully ud see that it asks which ios to USE
for the installation
so you select 249
04oic Quan
oh sorry thank u
ah
any games that supports classic controller and not gc controller, or are they interusable within virtual console and supporting wii games?
7There's two main melodies most of the time and two harmonies. O3o
7So, I tried two pianos, but then there's a part with three harmonies.
i got a es decrypt error bad hash sexual
i tried 223 with 37
it went to inistialize network and returned that as error
/me wished he was faster at clicking lots of eggs and Pokemon
the more you poke the eggs the better chance youll poke a hole in them
lol
04...:|
I don't play any GC games (atleast not until GC USB loading works), should I get 2x GC controllers or 2x classic controllers? I love the GC controller layout but haven't had a chance to try classic controller yet
Hahaha
no
trying to get the Adamant acheivement?
I'm breeding Gulpin
Oh
sexual any clue that didnt work for me
I'm taking the rats from the Shelter
well
it gave me a bad hash error
collecting Rattata then
trying to breed a skitty with a whale?
Did that already XD
D:
i am really not sure man i havnt done this in a while
D:
Poor, poor Skitty
:B
how can i find out
bucktooth smiley?
the other usbloader tell you which cios youve got installed
that you us
use
yeh
which one
what do you use
/me has the IceChat smilies turned off
i used wiiflow before but now i made the drive fat32 and use the cfg everything is working in that one
(hh)
Austin: Trigger added.
well go to cfg
just looks like two h's inside parentheses to me
ok
and the main menu by pressing "1" once or twice
:p
i forgot
yea, i find the gc controller to be very comfortable, i guess its just a matter of preference
they layouts are different
looks like a tasty sammach to me
!rules
then it will tell you @ the bottom the version
mmm
also
