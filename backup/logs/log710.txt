<prince-dari> What has she done that's bad?
<cachi01> FOR NAAAAAAARNIAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<cowvarkian> that was ridiculous
<magmablock> This story is happy end, save for the fact that everyone died
<otakon> of course this could all just be in her head in her last moments
<Phase4> hey Sumica, https://dl.dropbox.com/u/51948537/img/wave_666.png up for a chalenge once the movies over?
<Kinixys> Question: Do you believe?
<Ersatz> IT WAS ALL A DREAM. Sad end achieved.
<HoodyNinja> twilight_sprinkle: That is what we call
<Metronome> St least She die happy
<otakon> which it probably is
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> :'(
<Meanwhile> Hallucinating.
<Nyst> It's left open to interpretation.
<AJIsAwesome> So, dead?
<Tamazarashi> no yay! no!
<DocSane> Very dead.
<Saturn> 08,01yay
<thelonepony> yes :(
<HoodyNinja> twilight_sprinkle: That is what we call "moral ethics"*
<HeavyWeaPony_Guy> DED
<Meanwhile> But I think the point here is one of those "Decide for yourself" endings.
<Metronome> :'(
<HoodyNinja> Aw she dead
<Domo> Dead in the real world...?
<AlienWarhead> not a yay moment
<otakon> yeah sadly I'm going with dead
<Tassadork> otakon: that's the whole story. it's a fantasy land that she creates to deal with living during the war
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: well, cant tell if bad from what was shown, but for example, she disregarded what might happen to her mother if she did that whole madrake root thing
<Domo> --oh wait...
<AJIsAwesome> Yep, definitely Shadow Of The Collossus vibes.
<prince-dari> She did it because she thought it would help.
<Domo> this is some hardcore symbolism

<DerpyMuffins> Cya Tamazarashi
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: its not bad in itself, but it made me think thats part of the reason she wanted the whole immortality thing. and when the faun told her she lost, she started crying because she lost her chance to rule. these parts of her character seems like selfishness ot me
<cachi01> GIVE ME A 555 AND A 666
<HeavyWeaPony_Guy> Bye Tamazarashi
<Sumica> 00,10if you dont have every item maxed by wave 666 you suck

<HoodyNinja> Sumica: Or you just don't know where the shop is
<DerpyMuffins> I think she died and gone to 'heaven'
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: i understand that, but imo its a selfish reason no less
<cachi01> twilight_sprinkle: she didnt want INMORTALITY. she wanted to return to her kingdom where everything was peaceful
<HeavyWeaPony_Guy> Good Movie
<red_ony> I like it when the credits run through :3
<red_ony> for once
<HeavyWeaPony_Guy> why
<Kinixys> twilight_sprinkle: What was the unselfish choice?
<Buytoast> 9 tanks eh?
<prince-dari> Depends on what kind of definition of innocent you're using.
<DocSane> So much cold-blooded point-blank gun murder in this movie.
<HoodyNinja> It got so quiet...
<Buytoast> now that sounds fun
<prince-dari> Innocent in the sense of naive, she definitely was.
<OohShiny> ...
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: indeed it does
<J_E_Smith71> HoodyNinja: Now the quiet hour while the relaxing piano plays
<[wub]ehren> 0/10 credits still rolling

<otakon> Kinixys: he's a guard in the university that recognizes CELESTIA'S TOP STUDENT
<Sumica> 00,10Domo, mallet space
<Petrified_Discord> Read ALL the scrolls!
<DocSane> Kinixys: Because Twilight spent the last 10 years of her life in the Canterlot library?
<Saturn> 08,01this is probably my favourite episode of season 2
<Saturn> 08,01except for the finale
<otakon> I like it
<OohShiny> dat BGM is awesome
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> ITS COMMING
<OohShiny> the end is neihg

<otakon> XD
<Kencolt> She ai't trolling-- she's just being complementary.
<DocSane> Because you're Twilight Sparkle and this is a library.
<Everlasting_Joy> "Happy Tuesday" There's no such thing, now Thursdays. . .:).
*ASoftFluffyThing slowly paces around while mumbling to herself
<Sumica> 00,10just what was Tia doing in that part of the archives?
<OohShiny> no
<HeavyWeaPony_Guy> ohh yea
<OohShiny> she looks awesome
<Sumica> 00,10just happens to be on the way?
<otakon> trying to tell you not to waste her time
<cuteness_kitteh> I don't have a favorite episode. Ponies are ponies. :)
<DocSane> Remember, kids: Never plan ahead.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Sumica: she knows when and where shes needed
<Kencolt> HoodyNinja: Celestia LIVES THERE. I part of the Palace.
<AlienWarhead> I guess twilight does this kind of stuff a lot, thats why no one cares
<BroPony|MEDIC> inb4 futur spike
<otakon> hiya Kencolt what's up man?
<HoodyNinja> Kencolt: Yes, but she has a bedroom, right?
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<OohShiny> cuteness_kitteh: so you like MDW?
<cuddly_kittehs> cuteness_kitteh: WHY ARE THERE MORE KITTIES? >:<
<OJ> MY theory: Celestia actually has very poor social skills. She's reading Twilight's correspondence so she can learn.
<HoodyNinja> So why is she awake before the butt-ass crack of dawn?
<DocSane> This only makes sense if you haven't slept for days.
<Petrified_Discord> "I'm not a genius! I'm a chicken!"
<AlienWarhead> Sumica YOU CREATED A TIME PARADOX THE FUTURE WILL BE CHANGED
<Ryunosuke> and then twilightception
<OohShiny> and faill miserably
<HeavyWeaPony_Guy> Twilight just lied i know she will pace at a late time some time later
<Kencolt> HoodyNinja: Which she doesn't usually use during the DAY.
<oni_link> OJ: wow, makes sense
<cuteness_kitteh> OohShiny: Sorry, what now?
<AJIsAwesome> OohShiny: I do.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> that reused animation
<cuteness_kitteh> cuddly_kittehs: I just like cats... >.>
<otakon> um yeah
<Kencolt> This saved on animation costs.
<cuddly_kittehs> cuteness_kitteh: *stare*
<pony_300> come to think of it, twilight may have wasted that important spell and single chance on something more important
<OJ> Back to the Future reused scenes.
<otakon> Kencolt: still a fun scene though
<pony_300> just to tell herself not to worry
<HoodyNinja> Kencolt: But in order to say hi to Twilight in the library she had to be awake before the day
<Petrified_Discord> Epic Pony War
<cuddly_kittehs> paradox?
<cuteness_kitteh> cuddly_kittehs: *The Stare*
<AlienWarhead> Which pony should be Raiden?
<doctor_whooves127> why not say dont worry about the future
<cuddly_kittehs> PARADOX
<oni_link> PaladinDrakkenwolf: well yeah, it saves on cost and It makes sense. The same exact thing is supposed to happen so why re animate
<HoodyNinja> FUCK LOGIC THIS ISN"T FUN
<cuddly_kittehs> PARADOX
<oni_link> ?
<Everlasting_Joy> pony_300: There's more than one way to skin a cat.

<Kencolt> THey did not dub-- strictly-- "non Pariel". ^_^
<Sumica> 00,10now it is
<otakon> woah what
<oni_link> Saturn: Thats what i thought at first too. People tend to say that bass heavy is good quality. Sometimes the cheaper ones are better because they have more range .

<oni_link> Saturn: Im a bit of an audiophile because of my oldest brother. But I still dont know about those $4 earbuds. Also, I prefer out-ear head phones that isolate. Im still gonna try them because its $4 :|
<HoodyNinja> Inb4 hasbro is bought out by Toei and made into a full-on anime based around the power of friendship and its practical uses in war
<twilight_sprinkle> ah k thx PaladinDrakkenwolf (sry was afk), i might do that later, photoshop is a pain for me

<HoodyNinja> Sometimes, I wonder about my life
<twilight_sprinkle> i hate twilight ships, especially with fluttershy
<HoodyNinja> Now is not one of those moment
<Kandarihu> Well, Fluttershy is considered to be the model of Yamato Nadeshiko

<otakon> :)
<Tassadork> cannot wait to get singing dwarves on the OST for these movies!
<Ryunosuke> and with that, I am not paying attention to the Doctor discussion, as it is like politics and religion, it produces little results other than "your stupid and your face is ugly"
<richfiles> hmm.
*SpeccyRush oh god ze chills
<HeavyWeaPony_Guy> Dovkiin would be proud
<otakon> DocSane: expanding on more than The Hobbit

<Sumica> 00,10true twilight_sprinkle, I did't have many so i dont mind much

<SpeccyRush> Phase4: still having server problems?
<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja: i wasnt wrong, i was referring to the video
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> I DO WAT I WANT
<richfiles> Vita memory is horrifically overpriced.
*HoodyNinja dances on his table
<Phase4> SpeccyRush, found a viaduct server
*ASoftFluffyThing dances
<pony_431> lol
<Phase4> SpeccyRush, new mode on that

<cuddly_kittehs> Phase4: tf2...?
<richfiles> 16 GB Vita memory is $99 at my Gamestop
<twilight_sprinkle> so HoodyNinja , youre actually the one whos wrong, as always :3
<SpeccyRush> Phase4: whats the latency on that one?
<twilight_sprinkle> YES
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> lol

<HoodyNinja> I'm only slightly ever wrong, twilight_sprinkle
<otakon> holy crap wat
<JRP|lap|out> HOLY CRaP YES
<Phase4> SpeccyRush, 240ms here
<otakon> is this the actual show?
<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja: um no, there was a part where the author said "best pony status confirmed" which is what i was referrign to
<richfiles> 32 GB of Micro SD memory is $29 at Walmart. Sony is gouging on Vita memory
<J_E_Smith71> SpeccyRush: Only if Rhino's around
<HoodyNinja> twilight_sprinkle: Wich makes you wrong
<otakon> richfiles: yeah they did that ALL for extra profits
<Azuredragon> http://emotibot.net/?i=830
<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja: lis and slander
<twilight_sprinkle> *lies
<[Alpha]> Vita uses a specific memory card
<Sumica> 00,10where do spider men come from
<PS|BuckingAbout> Azuredragon: perfect timing
<ASoftFluffyThing> Sumica, radioactive spiders ,e
<HoodyNinja> Sumica: You know those noises you hear when you don't clean your closet for a while?
<Sumica> 00,10oh god that face
<HoodyNinja> They come from there
<Kencolt> GAH!
<otakon> richfiles: they were originally gonna have built in memory but NO that would mean people would be less inclined to buy cards. Also the whole re-downloading old games you already own to play on the Vita for FULL PRICE as a physical copy is absolutely criminal if you ask me
<Azuredragon> http://emotibot.net/?i=5603
<JRP|lap|out> mica play it fast forward
<otakon> OH GOD
<cachi01> look at le animation...its so.....60's
<richfiles> I've been messing with flash since 1 MB cost $45 in 1996. Vita memory is overpriced for profit. The chips only cost SLIGHTLY higher than lower speed flash, not enough to justify triple the price for half the storage
<PS|BuckingAbout> Azuredragon: you're killing me
<otakon> richfiles: exactly man
<[wub]ehren> WTF
<doctor_whooves127> i was an ordinary spider til i got bit by a radioactive man
<otakon> my GOD who thought this was GOOD?
<HoodyNinja> Wtf r I watching?
<[wub]ehren> NIGHTMARESZ
<otakon> HoodyNinja: the ORIGINAL 1960's Spiderman series
<HeavyWeaPony_Guy> Nerd!
<cachi01> HoodyNinja: 60's piderman
<Phase4> those faces D:
<Azuredragon> http://emotibot.net/?i=6161
<richfiles> I built memory cards for TI-85s back then. The chip cost is not that different between the various speeds. Sometime only a few dollars... or even cents.
<HoodyNinja> I know that >.<
<otakon> turning down girls for radioactivity
<HeavyWeaPony_Guy> i choos girls over books but thats just me
<HoodyNinja> But still, WTF am I watching?
<twilight_sprinkle> actually no HoodyNinja ,im noy letting you get off the hook, how was i wrong? come on gimmer ur best shot, nub :3
<cachi01> HeavyWeaPony_Guy: choosing girls over books?
<cachi01> WHAT?
<cachi01> IMPOSSIBLE
<otakon> wat
<otakon> really?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> dat colour
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> THE COLORS
<Phase4> dem colours
<otakon> Peter Parker monologuing about GETING EVEN?
<HeavyWeaPony_Guy> i know twilight would be disipointed
<[wub]ehren> books > girls
<cachi01> look at dem primary colours
<HoodyNinja> twilight_sprinkle: You were wrong because Twilight is best served plain, without sprinkles
<otakon> the HELL is wrong with this goddamn show?
<richfiles> I turn down everything to program CPLD chips! :$
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> SEIZURE
<otakon> Peter was NEVER like that
<richfiles> Except ponies
<richfiles> Never turn down ponies

<Sumica> 00,10must not fap
<twilight_sprinkle> lol
<Kencolt> otakon: Actually, to some extent at the very beginning, he was. The earliest Spider-man stuff was about teenage angst and trials as it was about kicking Vulture as and forgetting to take names.
<pony_300> rofl
<HoodyNinja> Wtf?
<[wub]ehren> ouchsomethingbitme
<HoodyNinja> Just a spider
<cachi01> XD

<J_E_Smith71> Just a spider? Shouldn't you worry about poison?
<[Alpha]> I'm gonna go (even though I haven't been here that long) my dreams are calling.
<Saturn> 08,01i've been in radioactive labs before
<Sumica> 00,10it's called hormones kid
<doctor_whooves127> those where the words on his tomb stone
<Saturn> 08,01they're actually quite boring
<Sumica> 00,10you need to rub one out
<Tassadork> Sumica: or maybe speed?
<Saturn> 08,01Sumica: what.
<HoodyNinja> Saturn: Unless you can dare someone to eat everything in sight
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: but thats because youve never experimentated on spiders and yourself
<richfiles> Oh Peter... It's your peter
<PS|BuckingAbout> lol
<HoodyNinja> dat punch effect
<PS|BuckingAbout> richfiles: that was perfect
<Kencolt> Four eyes-- when he's not wearing glasses? FAIL.

<HoodyNinja> 60's spiderman is OP
<Silver_Spoon> suddenly thin?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> dat run
<twilight_sprinkle> dat run :D
<thelonepony> :D
<Petrified_Discord> twilight_sprinkle: Gotta go fast
<cachi01> xD
<HeavyWeaPony_Guy> tight like a tiger
<Kencolt> Although no-such scene showed up in tge comics origin.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> twilight_sprinkle: their feet were slick with butter
<HoodyNinja> I cannot complain about old Scooby Doo anymore
<[wub]ehren> talking to yourself is the first sign of insanity parker
<Silver_Spoon> Inconsistent model is inconsistent
<cachi01> sooo no more clopping for mr parker
<HoodyNinja> [wub]ehren: When does the second sign show up?
<twilight_sprinkle> PaladinDrakkenwolf: reminds me of scooby doo
<Sumica> 00,10uncle ben nooooo
<[wub]ehren> it already has
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> lol
<twilight_sprinkle> that car, it doesnt see me!
<Petrified_Discord> Whhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaat
<doctor_whooves127> no no talking to yourfelf and getting a responce is a sign of insanity
<HoodyNinja> HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT
<HoodyNinja> SO CALMLY
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> STOP TALKING AND JUST ACT
<Tassadork> herp derp driving a car
<Kencolt> And Scooby Doo was FAR better animated.
<Silver_Spoon> leapt a tall building in a single bound? Sure he isn't superman?
<richfiles> Dat big faec
<Saturn> 08,01HoodyNinja: well, i once dared someoen to hold a beta-emitting thorium source up to their crotch
<DerpStar> Ah Spiderman
<Dovah> QQ
<Sumica> 00,10and I feel like I have a theme song now
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: wow....
<[wub]ehren> Saturn are they infertile?
<richfiles> I love dat ancing Sumi! :)
<HeavyWeaPony_Guy> old spiderman is porly animated spiderman
<cachi01> spiderman spiderman does whatever he fucking wants
<HoodyNinja> Silver_Spoon: super man can fly, so that doesn't count
<richfiles> dancing*
<Tassadork> I like this tie dye sky
<Saturn> 08,01[wub]ehren: their sperm count was low for a while
<Silver_Spoon> Thorium is mostly harmless
<[wub]ehren> damnit :(
<Silver_Spoon> mostly
<Saturn> 08,01but it was only a beta emitter
<DerpStar> Dem Drugs
<Sumica> 00,10he's making his fap face again
<doctor_whooves127> he's on drugs only real answer
<prince-dari> Alpha is most damaging but least penetrating isn't it?
<HeavyWeaPony_Guy> no shit realy
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: yup
<twilight_sprinkle> gamma prince-dari
<HoodyNinja> >Turn down sex
<Saturn> 08,01don't eat an alpha source.
<HoodyNinja> >get super powers
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: isnt it gamma? the neutrons?
<[wub]ehren> alpha = cant even move through air
<Megalomanic> As opposed to a dead spider
<HoodyNinja> ...
<prince-dari> twilight_sprinkle: Gamma, is most penetrating, but not as strong I thought
<twilight_sprinkle> alpha were protons iirc
<prince-dari> Or not as damaging
<HoodyNinja> I'm going to be single for awhile...
<[wub]ehren> gamma's still going to kill you
<Saturn> 08,01twilight_sprinkle: gamma is an EM wave and is the least ionising
<[wub]ehren> alpha will just kill you faster
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: oh i misread, i read the opposite of what yo usaid :P
<Sumica> 00,10science
<HeavyWeaPony_Guy> yea id turn down sex for super powers
<DerpStar> Science!
<Evil_Spike> This looks... old
<Saturn> 08,01twilight_sprinkle: beta is a fast moving electron, and is reasonably ionising
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: yah i know, alpha is proton
<Sumica> 00,10Evil_Spike, 1967
<doctor_whooves127> and thus petter parker became a super villian
<richfiles> I'd turn down human sex for a life in Equestria! :$
<Saturn> 08,01twilight_sprinkle: alpha is a helium nucleus (2 neutrons, 2 protons) and is the most ionising
<Petrified_Discord> MY lamp :|
<Evil_Spike> Johnny Quest?
<DerpStar> richfiles: eventually you'll regret that
<richfiles> Nah
<Sumica> 00,10may's gonna come in and wonder what is sticking all over the place in his room
<twilight_sprinkle> oh right.. its been a while since i did radiation stuff
<otakon> >simple doohickey
<twilight_sprinkle> also dat music lol
<HoodyNinja> How the fuck did he make that?
<Saturn> 08,01gamma is the most penetrative, though, so gamma sources are generally the most dangerous
<Tassadork> Saturn: thought it was the other way around, with gamma being the most ionizing
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> richfiles: then youd be a pony and hav p- nevermind
<otakon> >never replicated by real science
<Evil_Spike> Oh god, 60s Spiderman
<doctor_whooves127> why not the human spider?
<Saturn> 08,01because you can receive a higher radiation dose from them
<Sumica> 00,10alot of things to wing from over central park
<richfiles> yay! :( :)
<Saturn> 08,01Tassadork: nope
<Mega_Milk> Sumica: Two options. fess up to spankin it or reveal secret idetity.... >.>

<[wub]ehren> skyweb
<DerpStar> He has a lot of confidence in those webs
<Evil_Spike> Yay
<twilight_sprinkle> Tassadork: gamma is neutron, so no charge
<HoodyNinja> >swings over buildings
<Saturn> 08,01Tassadork: it is the most penetrating, though
<HoodyNinja> Wtf is he holding onto?
<Petrified_Discord> HoodyNinja: The skkybox
<prince-dari> I thought in medical tracers they'd usually use a gamma source though
<cachi01> HoodyNinja: onto the low budget
<[wub]ehren> silk
<Tassadork> thought that gamma radiation was electromagnetic, high energy photons
<twilight_sprinkle> doesnt gamma cause cancer
<Dovah> video, luna, minigun, name, please?
<Mega_Milk> twilight_sprinkle: That is a goo question -lol
<prince-dari> twilight_sprinkle: Well surely enoguh exposure to any radiation causes cancer
<Evil_Spike> What is he swing on?
<HeavyWeaPony_Guy> no it cause Hulk
<richfiles> Serious lun
<prince-dari> It's all about amount?
<Mega_Milk> Dovah: Serious lun
<Dovah> thank you!
<Saturn> 08,01twilight_sprinkle: gamma radiation is photons
<Sumica> 00,10Dovah, "srs luna"
<Petrified_Discord> Cat does not like spiderman
<Evil_Spike> SCIENCE!
<[wub]ehren> OH GAIZ VISISBLE LIGHT CAN CAUSE CANCER
<Saturn> 08,01none of alpha, beta, or gamma are just a neutron
<Petrified_Discord> And then this scene went on for WAY too long
<HeavyWeaPony_Guy> bill nye the SCIENCE! guy
<Evil_Spike> DRAMATIC ENTRANCE!
<Saturn> 08,01ionising radiation made of neutrons is called neutron radiation
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> dat shakey city
<HoodyNinja> And he never runs out of webs
<Mega_Milk> now he's just showing off....
<HoodyNinja> ever
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: oh, guess i need to go over that again, its been years since i did that :$
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> wow dramatic
<DerpStar> Well with powers like that
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> dat run
<Evil_Spike> Dat lip synch
<HeavyWeaPony_Guy> is it realy how it happend
<Saturn> 08,01i like radioactivity
<HoodyNinja> No
<prince-dari> How can a neutron be ionising anyway, that seems so contradictory.
<Saturn> 08,01i'm considering doing a masters in nuclear physics
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> I DO WAT I WANT
<Petrified_Discord> Spiderdick, Spiderdick...
<HoodyNinja> FUCK DA POLICE
<DerpStar> Spiderdouche
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: that's quite interesting actually

<prince-dari> God, Saturn, you're going to be at uni forever.
<Azuredragon> http://emotibot.net/?i=2720
<HoodyNinja> Web just went throught the window...
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Sumica: yes
<prince-dari> So many degrees. O_O
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> my head
<Saturn> 08,01a neutron absorption can cause emission of other types of radiation
<Petrified_Discord> The cop riding shotgun's face...my god XD
<Sumica> 00,10nice parg job
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: nuclear physics often comes down to nuclear reactor classes, which isnt as interesting as particle physics, although it depends where you study
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> here comes the regret
<DerpStar> They found his drugs
<Sumica> 00,10park*
<Saturn> 08,01so a neutron absorption can, for example, cause a gamma emission
<flutterchu> http://emotibot.net/pix/1673.jpg
<Saturn> 08,01which ionises the atom
<flutterchu> derp

<Kimori> not many things nowadays are made with metal, its all plastic

<Sumica> 00,10dont make it intelegent Polydunami but it's still his right
<Kimori> checked it online and it was worth a bunch of money, I ended up keeping the headphones from it because the sound is real good
<Polydunami> Right, I don't think I'll ever understand it anyway :S
<Kimori> I don't have a way to compare it to some expensive modern headphones now, but the sound is awesome on it.
<Kimori> compared to 10-20 dollar headphones from the store
<Cades> oh that's cool, I never knew that

<AJIsAwesome> I'm not really one to read fanfics.

<brony2447> AdamTheDuck: riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiighhhhhhttt <_<
<Polydunami> Yeah, I was asking about LOST because I just watched the first character death episode today.
<Polydunami> For the first time.
<brony2447> Ponies47: you havent done that yet? D: that should be a crime!
<Ponies47> brony2447: I know ;A;
*AdamTheDuck still hasn't modded his TF2
<Princess_Celestia> \,--is in a pny server on TF2
<brony2447> AdamTheDuck: *gasp* YOU NEED TO DO IT NOEW!
<Princess_Celestia> *pony
<therainbowvortex> hey my enternet just derped
<AdamTheDuck> Why? I like TF2 as it is. :<
<Polydunami> That's a funny way to spell internet :D
<brony2447> AdamTheDuck: :O
<Polydunami> I'd enter YOUR net, if you know what I mean :3
<Amu-chan> You do better than me... I drink like, 3-4 cans of soda a day... >->
<Princess_Celestia> TF2 with ponys is better :D
<Princess_Celestia> ^_^
<brony2447> ohai hacker, didnt see you there
<brony2447> oh wait...
<twilight_sprinkle> Polydunami: would you enter a barbed electrified net?
<Cades> I would if I actually had enough to drink 4 cans daily :P
<AdamTheDuck> That's why I play it on PonyFortress servers >.>
<Amu-chan> XD
<AdamTheDuck> I don't really want reskinned weapons, I like them as they are.
<Polydunami> Seems awful stupid
<Stormy> Wow, this makes me glad I don't like the stuff
<Stormy> XD
<Kimori> My sister can probably drink a case in a couple of days..
<brony2447> AdamTheDuck: at least the voices?
<MadSurge> Good morning Bronystate :)
<Kimori> I keep telling her shes going to be a diabetic but it doesnt make much of a difference
<Cades> i could easily drink a case of pepsi in a couple days
<AdamTheDuck> brony2447, voices? So like scout with RD's vocie?
<brony2447> i mean come on, who doesnt want rainbow dash on their team
<AdamTheDuck> Good morning to you MadSurge
<brony2447> AdamTheDuck: eeyup
<Sumica> 00,10ponyfort 2 ponys, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EryhQdXTjP8
<Kimori> I cant even if I tried
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, MadSurge! :)
<Cades> What's everyones favorite drink? Doesn't have to be soda
<Amu-chan> When I was younger I didn't drink soda at all, whenever I did I'd get the hiccups because I wasn't used to drinking it. XD
<NocturnalBlade> hi MadSurge
<brony2447> Sumica: my life in one utter..
<AdamTheDuck> But I then I'd need to get scout a RD model to fit the new voice :<
<Polydunami> Oh hey, MadSurge
*Gunny utters brony2447
<brony2447> AdamTheDuck: which they have anyway
<Amu-chan> My how things have changed. XD
<Kimori> Its hard to go cold turkey on soda
*brony2447 uhhhhh leather BEEEAALLT
<SharkMane> LOL
<Kimori> unless you drink the soda that doesnt have caffeine
<Ponies47> Hey MadSurge
*brony2447 UHHH YOU STOLE MEH LOOT UHH
<Polydunami> http://kp-shadowsquirrel.deviantart.com/art/Young-Fluttershy-332132649
<brony2447> that is pretty much a typical WoW player
<Amu-chan> I could easily stop drinking soda if I did so after being sick.
<brony2447> WoW is way overrated if you ask me
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Refresh embed :)
<Sumica> 00,10so for pony skins you have these http://wiki.ponyfortress2.com/index.php?title=MLP_Heroes
<Sumica> 00,10or these http://kassgrein.deviantart.com/
<Amu-chan> However, I have to get sick first, because the period of time not drinking it while I'm sick reduces my desire to drink it once I get better. That is, until I start drinking it again. XD
*MadSurge is dizzy from lack of sleep, meds and ear pain -__-
<AdamTheDuck> Yeah but it's having half the classes ponies and the other half normal

<geeky> twilight_sprinkle: ill sleep when im dead
<DeathStar> geeky: no you won't you'll be dead. sleeping involves being alive
<richfiles> Weird... Getting ads, like if it were a live episode stream???

<twilight_sprinkle> geeky: yeah ive decided i need to sleep and eat more, have been feeling too tired lately

<Buytoast> o'm guessing super brony is up to bat since i'm seeing galaxy
<DeathStar> geeky: nope you need to be alive to sleep

<geeky> DeathStar: heven is awesome sleep is awesome why not sleep all the dang time
<JRP> Phase4: what time is the nightly round up normaly at

<Spell-of-Gaming> I believe Super Mario Galaxy was supposed to be for the Gamecube
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02It wasn't actually.
<geeky> it died and became a star seems legit
<Buytoast> twilight princess was
<MadSurge> ^
<Buytoast> hell, the whole game is just mirrored
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Rayman Origins was originally designed for the Wii U :3
<MadSurge> NewSuperBronyU: and it's still awesome on Wii :D
<geeky> NewSuperBronyU: moo
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02O.O
<JRP> Something is technically wrong : is what twitter told me
<Spell-of-Gaming> No, I meant that Super Mario Galaxy was originally released for the Gamecube, one evidence supporting that fact is the Super Mario 128 tech demo.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Moo o.o
*geeky hugs NewSuperBronyU
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Super Mario 128 was developed into Pikmin
*NewSuperBronyU hugs geeky back :D
<DeathStar> SB was origionaly developed for the wiiU ^_^
<MadSurge> Hello NewSuperBronyU :) don't stand too close to me, I'm ill and sleepy :D
<Spell-of-Gaming> Sometimes, Super Mario Galaxy's physics are really weird.
<geeky> you can play as luige i want this game
<DeathStar> sometimes?
*NewSuperBronyU glomps DeathStar :3

<MadSurge> I want Luigi to have that treatment for once, and Mario be the underdog :D
<Spell-of-Gaming> I made the mistake of reformatting my Wii SD Card to NTFS
<geeky> richfiles: you dont
<Spell-of-Gaming> I'm glad it's over.
<AdamTheDuck> No geeky, I are a Sharpshooter.

<Princess_Celestia> o.O i have this game for xbox360
<Mutterguy> A green haired pegasususususussssss

<Mutterguy> but Conkers Bad fur day
<geeky> dat voice
<naturesfury> bummer
<JRP> NewSuperBronyU: YOUR MAKING MY INTERNET BILL EXPLOAD
<naturesfury> man u die ez in this game
<Spell-of-Gaming> Imagine how fun it would be to micspam Slenderman in the Xbox versions of CoD
<Spell-of-Gaming> People would probably freak out
<Serenity> Hey everypony
<Serenity> Why, is it SO DARMN COLD
<Sumica> 00,10ffa map eh?
<Serenity> Seems like it, though I don't get why I'm watching O.o
<Spell-of-Gaming> Oh wow, my semestral break is getting really fast.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Did that person's ovaries exploded
<Sumica> 00,10ever notice super likes to aim for the nuts
<richfiles> Yay. Installing Java so intels website can do the work for me to find the right driver... I HOPE :$
<Mutterguy> 3 month of Holidays :D
<Spell-of-Gaming> 8 kill streak? dayum
<Serenity> If this was Counter strike, he would have 1 million moniters in his head for haxxing :3
<richfiles> I hate new installs... So much stuff you take for granted is just not there! Flash, Java... SOUND! :[
<Serenity> Windows 7 is the most thankful for that kind of thing
<Sumica> 00,10such a good run
<Serenity> Takes me 3 hours to set up Vista or XP, takes me 10 minutes to set up 7
<Spell-of-Gaming> Yukkuri shitte ne~
<Spell-of-Gaming> I am waiting for Windows 8
<Serenity> Eww
<Sumica> 00,10win 8 is bad for gameing
<Serenity> ^
<Tabrenus> it's the same friggin thing
<Spell-of-Gaming> ...and see how many bad reviews it will get.
<richfiles> Yeah, older machine 2.4 GHz single core P4. I just need it to program Xilinx CPLD chips and maybe try some MINOR games on.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Let me finish, okay?
<richfiles> Running XP pro
<Jmo> 'Win 8 is bad for gaming'
<Jmo> How
<Tabrenus> strip away excess features and all windows 8 is, is windows 7 with a faster boot time
<Sumica> 00,10not optmised for it
<Serenity> Actually, to be fair, Windows 8 has had more change than any other OS so far. It's designed for tablets
<Jmo> Have you even USED it?
<Gunny> Dat first SB
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02>2147182753
<Serenity> Windows 8 needs 2G of RAM to use
<Spell-of-Gaming> I remember reading Windows 8 won't have support for DVDs
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Totally not a hacker.
<Jmo> I decided to test out W8, and I've found it to run better then W7 performance wise, even with games.
<Serenity> Sumica: How much GB of RAM does your PC have?
<Ponies47> 3:00 AM? Time for bed. Night everypony and thanks for silleh stream as always NewSuperBronyU :3
<Sumica> 00,10well the game developers are not impressed with it
<Sumica> 00,10Serenity 4 gigs
<richfiles> LOL... I don't even HAVE that much RAM in this ancient beast. I think it has 1.5 GB RAM... AND it's mismatched! :D
<Jmo> Game developers can go cry.
<Serenity> Yeah, that's why.
<Serenity> richfiles: El shitbox will always win the prize for terribleness
<richfiles> Eeyup! :$
<twilight_sprinkle> what does el shitbox mean?
<Serenity> It's my old computer
<Serenity> It was shite
<twilight_sprinkle> okay lul
<Serenity> I replaced it with a mid end gaming PC
<richfiles> As long as I can program my chips... DANG... That CAD/programmnig app was 6.2 GB COMPRESSED!!! The install was 13 GB! :O :)
<Sumica> 00,10no Jmo they will go with othere OS's
<Spell-of-Gaming> I can hook up my smartphone to my PC and see its screen
<Spell-of-Gaming> Problem is, it has 4-5 FPS
<Serenity> Spell-of-Gaming: That's because 1. Smartphones are parp, and 2ndly, they don't quite have the processing power
<Tabrenus> that's 1 reason
*Panda has windows 8
<Panda> Its ok...
<JRP> NewSuperBronyU: you broke my phone
<Jmo> What other OS?
<richfiles> I have NO clue about ANYTHING PC... How bad is Radeon 9200 SE... *waits for cringeworthy response*
<Jmo> Only got Linux and iOS
<Spell-of-Gaming> ...Oh, did I saw smartphone?
<Spell-of-Gaming> *say
<Serenity> Yeah, heh
<Spell-of-Gaming> I meant Android phone.
<Jmo> And they already make games for them already.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Which is literally slow
<Serenity> That's even worse then
<Jmo> Unless a new OS pops up from Valve or such.
<JRP> NewSuperBronyU: you will not belive how easy it is to hack wii games and abuse cheats
<Ponies47> Good night :3
<Serenity> JRP: He knows, it has been like that since launch
<Jmo> At first I thought W8 was gonna have a ton of bugs and compatibility issues, but funny enough I haven't found any so far.
<Spell-of-Gaming> I'm kinda disappointed in Google not making an OS
<Serenity> Compatibility will be fine, but you'll need a monster truck to run it with stuff like Far Cry 3 and whatever
<Cades> night everyone

<JRP> i has like a 3600x1080

<richfiles> My computer. It has pixel real estate and storage... 18 TB, but no bawls under the hood... Mac is a measly dual 1.8 GHz w 4 G RAM, and the PC is only a single core 2.4 GHz P4 :(
<brony2447> i am back from TF2!
<richfiles> Yeah... That pick was from the night we played Airplane and Top Secret! :)
<richfiles> pic

<Serenity> richfiles: Wow, where'ed you get Bronystate 1.0 from?

<Ninjazz> God that is the one thing I missed so much while I was here.
<Ninjazz> My heart in constant trauma.
<Petrified_Discord> Lunacorn: Cider
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, I think someone already sent me that one.
<Lunacorn> Petrified_Discord: i hope so..
<Lunacorn> Petrified_Discord: but anyway thanks ^_^
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: she's almost identical to the real deal :D
<Polydunami|LOST> Oh hey, a new brony?
<Lunacorn> Polydunami|LOST: ive been a brony for 20 minutes
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, that I agree with.
<Polydunami|LOST> It's coming up to one year since I've started watching the show.
<Lunacorn> Polydunami|LOST: cool
<Ninjazz> It's been well past my anniversary for being a hater.
<alexxm> it's been about a year and a few months
<Petrified_Discord> Lunacorn: So how'd you find out about Luna? I'm assuming you haven't seen an episode yet :)
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: mine is getting close :D
<Polydunami|LOST> I believe I started after Sisterhooves Social aired.
<Lunacorn> Petrified_Discord: two best sisters
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, haha, how far we've come, eh?
<MadSurge> Polydunami|LOST: actually, me too
<Polydunami|LOST> Oh wow
<Petrified_Discord> Lunacorn: Portal or Resident Evil?
<Lunacorn> Petrified_Discord: i watched both
<Petrified_Discord> Lunacorn: Good choice :P
<Polydunami|LOST> I didn't even discover Bronystate until near the end of January.
<Ninjazz> I think mine was... Hmm. I want to say after a Friend in Deed...
<Polydunami|LOST> That was a rough time for me :S
<Lunacorn> apparently (from what i learned) celesia is an ass ans REALLY likes bananas
<Lunacorn> can somebody explain that?
<Ninjazz> >_>
<MadSurge> Polydunami|LOST: first "new" episode was May The Best Pet Win and the first live episode was reading RD :D
<Polydunami|LOST> Well, that's fandom for you
<Ninjazz> Don't listen to them.
<Petrified_Discord> Lunacorn: That's actually all fanon
<Lunacorn> Petrified_Discord: so she is'nt an ass?
<Ninjazz> Nope.
<Polydunami|LOST> Same here, but with Cutie Pox instead of Pets.
<Petrified_Discord> Lunacorn: It's based on a flash cartoon where she asks people whether or not they like bananas and randomly sends them to the moon
<Lunacorn> Petrified_Discord: I remember this ghetto kid at school said i was a bitch who dont like bananas lol
<MadSurge> Lunacorn: don't listen. People will make anyone the worst monster in history while trying to save the real villains because they're "just misunderstood"
<Petrified_Discord> Lunacorn: That's what it's from XD
<Petrified_Discord> Lunacorn: Lunacorn: The "banish to the moon" thing actually does happen though (to Luna). Bananas are just random :P
<Lunacorn> :O NOOO LUNA!!
<Polydunami|LOST> So Lunacorn, have you watched any episodes yet?

<therainbowvortex> oh
<Lunacorn> Polydunami|LOST: wut :S
<Petrified_Discord> Lunacorn: Yeah, when referring to ponies and buffallo twilight uses "anyone" and not "anypony"
<Lunacorn> Petrified_Discord: ok... buffalo?
<Polydunami|LOST> You know of the little purple dragon Spike, right?
<Lunacorn> yeah, he seemed like a doormat or something
<Ninjazz> And instant hat.
<Ninjazz> DANG YOUR LUCK PHASE.
<Polydunami|LOST> Heh, yeah, especially when concerned with certain ponies ;)
<MadSurge> Lunacorn: he's the purple unicorn's assistant
<Ninjazz> Spike knows who's the best. He's alright.

<Polydunami|LOST> Twilight Sparkle :)
<Petrified_Discord> Best pony
<MadSurge> Lunacorn: Twilight Sparkle, yes, the "main" protagonist of the series
<Lunacorn> Polydunami|LOST: ahh ok... wait.. like the vamps? 0-0
<Polydunami|LOST> Crazy name they picked after all the crazy vampire hubbub.
<Ninjazz> Vamps?...
<Lunacorn> vampires
<Polydunami|LOST> But it's completely unrelated.
<MadSurge> ^
<Petrified_Discord> "Why do the vampires in twilight sparkle?" "Why do the vampires in me what?"
<Ninjazz> Oooooh. That mess.
<Ninjazz> Yeah, doesn't register with me.
<alexxm> suddenly boom
<Polydunami|LOST> Yeah, I don't associate the name with the Twilight Saga either :3
<Lunacorn> ok.. so i have 5 names.. Luna Pinkie Rainbow Twilight and.. Celestia
<Ninjazz> Learn this name.
<Ninjazz> Rarity.
<Ninjazz> I say it alot.
<Lunacorn> what?
<Polydunami|LOST> The white one with the curled purple mane and tail.
<Ninjazz> The beautiful purple maned, white unicorn.
<NewSuperBronyU|Zzz> 11,02Night all :)
<Lunacorn> rarity? sounds like some snobby british dress-maker
<Petrified_Discord> Lunacorn: Oh yeah, her full name is Rainbow Dash
<NewSuperBronyU|Zzz> 11,0222 days :3
<Ninjazz> With the maginificent squiggles.
<Ninjazz> Nacht SB.
<alexxm> bye NewSuperBronyU|Zzz
<Petrified_Discord> Lunacorn: And Pinkie Pie
<Polydunami|LOST> Goodnight, SB
<Ninjazz> You'll learn very quick how wonderful she is, Lunacorn. Very quick or very slow.
<Lunacorn> Ninjazz: she seems wild, to say the least
<Petrified_Discord> Lunacorn: PFFFT
<Ninjazz> She's great.
<Lunacorn> Petrified_Discord: ?
<Polydunami|LOST> Oh hey, the yellow one with the pink mane? She's Fluttershy.
<Ninjazz> Oh yeah her she's in the show too.
<Ninjazz> She gets mad and stuff happens to her.
<Ninjazz> And she's cute.
<Petrified_Discord> Rarity is the refined one. Overly melodramatic and such. A fair number of people think she's worst pony.
<Ninjazz> I guess. >_>
<Petrified_Discord> Not me, of course, but still :P
<Ninjazz> Petrified_Discord, good man. I like you.
<Lunacorn> fluttershy? seems legit
<Polydunami|LOST> Well, she did get overly mad in the one episode you saw, but she's not usually like that.
<Petrified_Discord> Lunacorn: Last one of the "mane" 6 for you is "Applejack"
<Ninjazz> I'd say she got mad for a good reason for a lost cause though.
<Lunacorn> Polydunami|LOST: ahh ok so she isnt a crazy psycho bitch, then?
<Ninjazz> Blueblood... >__>
<Polydunami|LOST> Not usually
<Malavolent> Ello there.
<Lunacorn> Petrified_Discord: applejack? like the cereal?
<Polydunami|LOST> And the drink.
<Ninjazz> 'ey Malavolent.
<Polydunami|LOST> Hey there, Malavolent
<alexxm> how've you been Malavolent
<Petrified_Discord> Lunacorn: Yup. She's the southern farm-working pony with the Stetson
<Polydunami|LOST> I keep wanting to type "Malevolent" :S
<Lunacorn> hold on someone is spamming me on skype hold on...
<Malavolent> alexxm: I'm fine, but the weather here is terrible.
<Lunacorn> cupcakes? seems cool is that like a song or something?
<Polydunami|LOST> Oh dear, Cupcakes.
<Lunacorn> he keeps spammong me and telling me to watch it..it must be good
<Ninjazz> First warning.
<Ninjazz> Don't.
<Petrified_Discord> Lunacorn: Unless you like gore, DO NOT READ CUPCAKES.
<Ninjazz> Torture porn.
<Petrified_Discord> Pretty much.
<Malavolent> Come on guys, spoilers.
<Lunacorn> OMG WTF!!!!! NOOOOOOOO!!! WHYYYY??!!! DAMMIT!!!! NOOOOOOOOOOO
<alexxm> slenderman?
<Ninjazz> For justice, Malavolent.
<Polydunami|LOST> Yeah, Cupcakes is kind of peculiar.
<Lunacorn> you should have warned me earlier :'(
<Ninjazz> Lunacorn, fandoms'll do that.
<Polydunami|LOST> Read: Fucked up.
<Ninjazz> Lolwut.
<Ninjazz> You read/watched it already?
<Lunacorn> i need a hug :(
<NewSuperBronyU|Zzz> 11,02Lunacorn: My reaction to Rayman Legends being delayed.
*Petrified_Discord hugs Lunacorn
<Petrified_Discord> Lunacorn: The other well-known fic is "My Little Dashie." It's super sad, so you can decide whether or not to read that.
*NewSuperBronyU|Zzz hugs Lunacorn
<Polydunami|LOST> Oh, the other famous one.
<Ninjazz> The other fic, yeah. It's alright.
<Lunacorn> thank you ;:u:; i needed the huggles
<Ninjazz> Not so much a big deal, unless you're sensitive.
<Polydunami|LOST> Yeesh, I nearly cried at that one LOST episode
<Lunacorn> i think im going to read my friends fanfic
<Malavolent> Check out Rainbow Factory, it's much more happier.
<Ninjazz> Lol.
<Polydunami|LOST> :[
<Lunacorn> he says he comes on here, do any of yall know Brony2447?
<Polydunami|LOST> Oh yeah, I've seen him around
<Lunacorn> Polydunami|LOST: he acts cool?
<Ninjazz> Let me do you a favor and recommend you Heart of a Dragon, Lunacorn.
<Polydunami|LOST> I don't recall
<Petrified_Discord> Lunacorn: Just to make sure you know, Rainbow Factory is also gore
<Lunacorn> Petrified_Discord: o-o
<Ninjazz> Not too gory, it's more sad imo.
<Petrified_Discord> Anything is less gory than Cupcakes :P
<Ninjazz> It's not as detailed.
<Ninjazz> Oooooh Petrified_Discord, not true.
<Ninjazz> >_>
<Ninjazz> <_<
<Lunacorn> damn.. ive only beena brony for 30 min and i already got over 100 hate comments :(
<Lunacorn> damn trolls!
<Petrified_Discord> Lunacorn: On what?
<Polydunami|LOST> On Skype?
<Lunacorn> Petrified_Discord: skype
<Lunacorn> STAHP SPAAMIN MEH! :[
<Petrified_Discord> Oh well, c'est la vie :)
<Lunacorn> oh forget it, im signing off
<Polydunami|LOST> Yeah, comes with the territory
<Petrified_Discord> Just gotta love and tolerate the haters
<Lunacorn> umm?
<Ninjazz> Or ignore them, that works too.
<Petrified_Discord> That too
<Polydunami|LOST> Uhh, that's kind of a cliched statement, "Love and tolerate"
<Polydunami|LOST> Misused as well
<Polydunami|LOST> Sometimes
<Lunacorn> ok..
<Ninjazz> Taken to the extreme.
<Petrified_Discord> It's an overused statement but still
<Lunacorn> i saw this one pic that said "I'm going to love and tolerate the sh*t outta you"
<Petrified_Discord> This one: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/887/
<Ninjazz> That's probably the correct usage. An anti-troll weapon.
<Ninjazz> But now it's in a different context. >_>
<Lunacorn> ok...
<Polydunami|LOST> Yeah, I'd find that horribly obnoxious.
<Petrified_Discord> http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/140/529/ilvr7b.jpg?1318992465
<Ninjazz> Same.
<Polydunami|LOST> That one, I'm okay with. It's funny
<Petrified_Discord> There's one more good one. Gotta find it...
<Lunacorn> srry guys i have to get off now cause my friend is taking his computer back :(
<Lunacorn> you wanna guess who?
<Polydunami|LOST> Right, don't be a stranger Lunacorn
<Ninjazz> Pictures usually tend to be a joke along with the phrase.
<Polydunami|LOST> It's brony2447, isn't it?
<Lunacorn> Polydunami|LOST: yup.. thats what i get for staying at his house :(
<Polydunami|LOST> Again, don't be a stranger.
<Lunacorn> Polydunami|LOST: okai but i srsly have to get off now so i will see you
<Polydunami|LOST> See you :)
<Petrified_Discord> See you later Lunacorn :)
<Ninjazz> Later.
<Petrified_Discord> Found it http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw3529-anti_hate_shield_by_metalbeersolid-d4brl09.gif
<Lunacorn> bai everypony! thank you for educating me!
<Polydunami|LOST> Is that what we were doing? :S
<Ninjazz> ...
<Polydunami|LOST> Well, that was fun
<brony2447> ohai bronystate :)
<brony2447> i see you met my friend
<Polydunami|LOST> Yeah, Lunacorn's a lot of fun
<brony2447> great! he's an awesome guy!
<Petrified_Discord> brony2447: So it's up to you to get him to watch the first episode, you hear? :)
<Polydunami|LOST> Right, I was about to guess his gender otherwise -_-
<brony2447> Petrified_Discord: yup
<Polydunami|LOST> That was the season 1 finale, though.
<Petrified_Discord> ?
<brony2447> Petrified_Discord: hes watching applebuck season now, for some reason
<Petrified_Discord> lolwat
<Ninjazz> Best Night Ever.
<brony2447> you should have seen the look on his face when i first told him about mlp
<brony2447> he was like, umm..no
<Polydunami|LOST> That's my sister's take on the craze
<brony2447> but then i made him watch it and he was like "omg this is amazing"
<brony2447> and i showed him this site and alas! he was on!
<Polydunami|LOST> Yeah, my family knows that I've watched and enjoyed the show. They don't really care.
<brony2447> literally seconds after being a brony
<Ninjazz> My familiy don't care. Too much.
<brony2447> i'm happy i could get him to join :)
<Petrified_Discord> At least this way he didn't have to wait 7 months for season 3
<Ninjazz> A smark remark here and there.
<Polydunami|LOST> So is everypony else
<Polydunami|LOST> Seven months? Has it been that long already?
<brony2447> Polydunami|LOST: eeyup
<alexxm> so what does the halloween update bring to team fortress
<AdamTheDuck> alexxm, new hat :P
<brony2447> lol he was clever to come up with lunacorn, too
<Phase4> dinner time
<Polydunami|LOST> Wait, that's more like six months. Six and a half?
<Ninjazz> I lost count.
<Polydunami|LOST> Six and two thirds?
<AdamTheDuck> Oh Phase4 was streaming the whole time?
<Phase4> AdamTheDuck, that i was
<alexxm> AdamTheDuck every update does that
<Ninjazz> And then you made Phase sad.
<Ninjazz> Bad Adam.
<Phase4> XD
<AdamTheDuck> I was playing TF2 with him Ninjazz XD
<brony2447> Petrified_Discord: lol hes begging me for the comp now
<Polydunami|LOST> HI LUNACORN
<Ninjazz> And you weren't watching the stream at the same time, Adam?
<brony2447> he says hi

<Polydunami|LOST> I feel like I'm on TV :D
<Ninjazz> Lol.
<AdamTheDuck> Ninjazz, but... But... I had kill cam to see him :<
<Petrified_Discord> brony2447: Sure :P
<Ninjazz> Fair enough, Adam. >_>
<AdamTheDuck> <_<
<brony2447> Petrified_Discord: okay then im watching applebuck season see ya for now
<Polydunami|LOST> Righto
<Lunacorn> im back!
<Polydunami|LOST> Doing the tango now?

<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Lunacorn
<Polydunami|LOST> Wait, I meant to say "Tag team"
<Petrified_Discord> Tag team tango
<Polydunami|LOST> :D
<Lunacorn> Polydunami|LOST: i suppose so.. he only let me on because i kept punching him in the arm..lol it got really red..
<Lunacorn> lol jk he is just nice
<Petrified_Discord> lol
<Ninjazz> You can just /nick to switch, you know.
<Lunacorn> Ninjazz: thx!
<Ninjazz> Yup. np.
<Lunacorn> he was telling me about derpy too
<Polydunami|LOST> :P
<Polydunami|LOST> 6_9
<Lunacorn> is that her?
<Petrified_Discord> Lunacorn: Yup
<Ninjazz> Indeed she is. Are you offended?
<Polydunami|LOST> Started from a mistake in the first episode
<Petrified_Discord> Lunacorn: Oh boy...welcome to the world of background ponies my friend :D
<Lunacorn> Petrified_Discord: no why the hay would anypony be offended by that? she's cute! <3
<Petrified_Discord> Lunacorn: It's a long story. Don't worry about it
<Lunacorn> Petrified_Discord: well brony2447 said the hub disgraced her name.. i suppose i will learn later
<Polydunami|LOST> Yeah, she became a major hit with the fans
<Ninjazz> ohboyherewego.jpg
<therainbowvortex> hey every pony i have a friend here with me he dosent belive males ove 12 would like mlp so can i have a show of hands wo is male and over 12
<Ninjazz> I'm 18.
<Polydunami|LOST> 22
<Lunacorn> i am 15
<HavokOC> I'm 14
<Lunacorn> brony2447 is 14 too
<HavokOC> :D
<Lunacorn> he wanted me to tell yall :P
<HavokOC> lawl
<Petrified_Discord> Lunacorn: In a nutshell they finally gave her a voice but some people found it upsetting that she sounded kinda...retarded. So the HUB was in a sticky situation where they couldn't keep it up or take it down without upsetting somone
<Polydunami|LOST> Aww, that was supposed to be a surprise :(
<Petrified_Discord> Lunacorn: They ended up changing her voice and bronies got really pissed about that
<Lunacorn> Petrified_Discord: oh ok.. well it really doesnt matter as long as they acknowlege her!
<therainbowvortex> Petrified_Discord: you talking about derpy hoves
<Petrified_Discord> Eeyup
<Ninjazz> Yes, the drama and stupidity that revolved around that.
<Ninjazz> On both sides. >_>
<Lunacorn> and now i am meddling around on brony2447's deviantart.. MUHAHAHAHA!
<MadSurge> Lunacorn: it was because the voice actress wasn't aware she was supposed to voice act a mare, so she gave her a boyish voice
<Petrified_Discord> I don't think so...what makes you say that?
<MadSurge> Which apparently means Derpy is a retard
<Ninjazz> Yeah. Tabitha voiced her.
<Petrified_Discord> Is that really why she did the voice that way?
<Ninjazz> Apparently.
<MadSurge> Petrified_Discord: yes
<Polydunami|LOST> Whoa, I forgot I still had Google Earth open
<Petrified_Discord> Huh.
<Petrified_Discord> Whelp. Still don't care :D
<Polydunami|LOST> My computer was hardly slow
<Ninjazz> She took her out of her credits when the crap hit.
<Lunacorn> retards dont act like that.. ive had PLENTY of experience with REAL retards
<Petrified_Discord> MOVING ON!
<Lunacorn> i mean actually mentally
<Ninjazz> Please do.
<MadSurge> I am fine with both voices though :D
<Ninjazz> Same.
<Petrified_Discord> Lunacorn: Another well-known background pony is "Lyra Heartstrings" or just Lyra for short
<therainbowvortex> Petrified_Discord: i saw that save derpy video and it made me cry a little
<Polydunami|LOST> Dead Island will do that to you
<Lunacorn> Petrified_Discord: you mean the "ew, gay!" pony?
<Polydunami|LOST> Speaking of Islands...
<Ninjazz> But I still have to say, the boyish version of Derpy saying "Yeeeaaaaah, Applejack! Whooooo!" is a bit cuter, imo.
<Petrified_Discord> Lunacorn: yeah
<Lunacorn> Petrified_Discord: brony2447 just showed me that :P
<Polydunami|LOST> Nah, I'll save the season finale for tomorrow.
<JRP> tired
<Moopy> Night everypony i'd better hit the hey so a see yall in the morning ok night yall
<Polydunami> Good night, Moopy
<Petrified_Discord> Lunacorn: There's one scene where she's sitting like a human, so it spawned the fanon that she's obsessed with the mythical creatures known as "humans"
<therainbowvortex> night Moopy
<Lunacorn> Petrified_Discord: wut.
<Petrified_Discord> Lunacorn: http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/006/162/friends_by_binaryninj4-d3bzvxe.png
<MadSurge> Lunacorn: so what do you like? Videogames, books, movies, coding? :)
<Polydunami> I don't remember this at all, Petrified_Discord
<Petrified_Discord> Lunacorn: irk?
<Polydunami> Where was this?
<Lunacorn> MadSurge: many things
<MadSurge> Polydunami: in Dragonshy, for a split second while Pinkie was counting ponies
<Lunacorn> MadSurge: mostly books
<AdamTheDuck> Hehe, are we trying to explain Lunacorn all the different background ponies? :$
<Petrified_Discord> Polydunami: I think it was in Dragonshy. Pinkie Pie was counting ponies in the park
<Polydunami> Right
<Polydunami> I didn't think to look :S
<Lunacorn> now brony2447 (whom i will now refer to as erin) is showing me shrugging ponies
<Ninjazz> You have A LOT to see, Lunacorn. Tread with caution.
<Ninjazz> (Me scaring the newbie)
<Lunacorn> Ninjazz: o rly?
<MadSurge> Lunacorn: in a nutshell, it's very likely you will find fanart/fannames for all background ponies :D
<Ninjazz> Yes rly.
<AdamTheDuck> inb4 the... Plushie... :$
<MadSurge> NO
<Petrified_Discord> Lunacorn: It's funny how he hasn't even seen a full episode yet and we're starting off with background ponies and memes of all things XD
<Lunacorn> Ninjazz: dude, someone tricked me into r34.. i can handle anything
<alexxm> no i do not want to see that thing again
<Ninjazz> Plushies? Like the plushies everyone has been smothering me with?
<Ninjazz> Over $500.
<Ninjazz> My eyes.
<Ninjazz> My tears.
<Petrified_Discord> Ninjazz: What else are we gonna do with them BUT smother you?
<MadSurge> Why so costly :'(
<Ninjazz> Lunacorn, good man. Just watch for the hardcore stuff.
<Ninjazz> Petrified_Discord, YOU'RE EVIL.
<Petrified_Discord> :D
<Ninjazz> YOU SURGE, SPRECTRUM_RUCH ARE ALL EVIL.
<Jmo> o_O
<Lunacorn> oh celestia.. now Erin is explaining clopping.. uhhh....
<Petrified_Discord> DAMMIT ERIN

<Ninjazz> Especially since Val is here.
<Ninjazz> Hide the drugs!
<therainbowvortex> MadSurge: you too so am i
<Lunacorn> (this is erin) o rly?
<Petrified_Discord> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1372/
<Lunacorn> Petrified_Discord: that is pretty much his reaction
<Lunacorn> (still erin
<Petrified_Discord> Alternatively: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2307/

<Lunacorn> HavokOC: erin is brony2447
<HavokOC> :o
<Ninjazz> /nick...
<Petrified_Discord> Lunacorn: Okay, I gotta ask. Why Applebuck Season as a first episode?
<Lunacorn> Petrified_Discord: *insert shrugging pony here*
<AdamTheDuck> shrugpony.jpg
<Petrified_Discord> Fair enough :)
<Lunacorn> Petrified_Discord: plus erin wanted to show me big mac
<Polydunami> Aha!
<Petrified_Discord> Big Mac. The only character I can quote before he actually says anything :P
<Lunacorn> and now all i can think about is ponies
<Lunacorn> which is not a bad thing
<Petrified_Discord> Just bear in mind that episode 1 (and 2) has Luna. Soooooo yeah
<Lunacorn> Petrified_Discord: ok? thanks
<Ninjazz> Ponyville Confidential is by far Big Mac's star episode.
<Ninjazz> He was an inspiration.
<Petrified_Discord> Also exposition. Soooooooooooooo much exposition
<Lunacorn> NUUUU! bronies!? Y U CONFUSE ME??
<Petrified_Discord> lol what are you confused about?
<Lunacorn> Petrified_Discord: so much stuff being shoved into my mind.. so much....POOOONIES!
<Petrified_Discord> Okay okay
<Petrified_Discord> Step 1: Watch episodes 1 and 2
<brony2447> you should be ashamed
<brony2447> haha
<Polydunami> I feel like I'm talking to Doctor Jekyll here

<Lunacorn> Jake: logic does not apply here
<Dashie_Dashie> half my deck is trap cards and equipt spell cards.
<Jake> as always
<Dashie_Dashie> I can one turn summon blue eyes ulitmate and basically win.
<Lunacorn> half my deck is nothing because i dont have one :O
<Jake> just cause and prototype would be pretty boring with proper logic
<killerpony7733> Oh yeah i remember the yugioh PC games those were fun
<MadSurge> Dashie_Dashie: I heard the DS games are better at being a challenge luckily
<Dashie_Dashie> I haven't gotten the DS ones yet, I'll have to order'em
<therainbowvortex> night all
<Dashie_Dashie> goodnight therainbowvortex
<Lunacorn> ok srsly can somepony come down her to texas and punch erin in the face he is SOOO annoying
<alexxm> bye therainbowvortex
<Ninjazz> It's time to du-du-du-d-d-d-d-duel.
<Polydunami> Good night, therainbowvortex
<Ninjazz> Nacht therainbowvortex.
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight therainbowvortex
<MadSurge> Which Colossus is this?
<Dashie_Dashie> BATTLE TEIM
<cowvarkian> so, I guess something is streaming
<Dashie_Dashie> Am I the only one that thought Twilight princess took elements from this game?
<MadSurge> cowvarkian: correct
<Ninjazz> You ever think he just imagine to himself "I have to kill this thing?".
<cowvarkian> Ninjazz: one might think that
<MadSurge> Dashie_Dashie: nope, you're not the first making that argument
<Ninjazz> I would be.
<Polydunami> Even when Twilight Princess was released afterward?
<Petrified_Discord> I'd say that it evoked a similar feeling
<Lunacorn> erin said somepony PLEEEASE add him on steam oh yeah and he said i told you so Petrified_Discord
<Ninjazz> This sounds rather LotR.
<cowvarkian> ah, now streams working
<Jake> i only played phantom hourglass, spirit tracks, and a little bit ocarina of time
<Petrified_Discord> Lunacorn: Told me so what?
<Lunacorn> Petrified_Discord: beats me
<Polydunami> I've played all of them except for Minish Cap
<Petrified_Discord> lolk
<cowvarkian> so iirc this guy is killing all these things for a girlfriend, right?
<Lunacorn> Petrified_Discord: gotta expect that from erin (he has ADD)
<Petrified_Discord> Lunacorn: http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/126/3/0/making_woon_by_egophiliac-d4yr2xb.png
<Polydunami> Yeah, cowvarkian, he's trying to get mono :P
<Lunacorn> LUUNA! I WANNA BE TEH POSTAGE STAMP!
<Polydunami> Rather, get Mono BACK.
<cowvarkian> Polydunami: ah not the disease
<cowvarkian> Polydunami: but a person named mono
<Polydunami> Yep
<cowvarkian> Polydunami: this is silly
<Lunacorn> well..
<Polydunami> I don't think this could be well described as a silly game
<MadSurge> ^
<Polydunami> Except when Wander is slip sliding all over the place.
<cowvarkian> what person in their right mind would set out to kill the last of a collosal breed of creature, just for a fucking girl
<Ninjazz> I think it adds tension, personally.
<Petrified_Discord> Polydunami: Especially if you add sound effects during those parts
<Petrified_Discord> "Wheeeeeeeee"
<Ninjazz> cowvarkian, considering how she's the only slightly living being other than that god send of a horse that isn't trying to kill him? Not by much.
<cowvarkian> Ninjazz: ah, well maybe that makes a bit more sense
<cowvarkian> Ninjazz: but still
<Polydunami> Yeah, Luna is a taken name.
<Ninjazz> I know. I know. but look through it in his eyes.
<Polydunami> Belongs to one of our moderators
<Ninjazz> And well, this is also a Japanese game.
<cowvarkian> Ninjazz: but when he kills all the things doesnt he get fucked over?
<cowvarkian> Ninjazz: I know
<Ninjazz> cowvarkian, I'm not sure... I haven't played this game. I've heard TONS of stuff about it though.
<Polydunami> Yeah, most of them are Japanese games.
<cowvarkian> Polydunami: you mean teh ones caramel streams?
<cowvarkian> *the
<Polydunami> No, I mean video games in general tend to originate from Japan.
<cowvarkian> Polydunami: oh, welll that works too
<Ninjazz> Except Dragon Age, most of the streams I've seen Val do are Japanese games.
<Jake> I should totally play some anno
<cowvarkian> Jake: anno?
<Jake> 2070
<MadSurge> ValtheJean: any chance you might stream Killer7? :D
<cowvarkian> Jake: oh yeah, that looked good
<Jake> it is
<cowvarkian> Jake: good to know
<Jake> now that i have the addon
<cowvarkian> Jake: >_> which addon
<Polydunami> Now Killer7 seems awfully precarious to stream live, don't you think?
<Jake> the deep sea addon
*Lunacorn is playing TF2 and cannot take any pings (also just learned about /me)
<MadSurge> Polydunami: yeahhhhh :D
<Jake> its a complexity coloss now
<cowvarkian> Lunacorn: ping
<Lunacorn> cowvarkian: STAHP
<cowvarkian> Lunacorn: :p
<Jmo> Ninjazz|Away, pls dnt go ;_;
<Polydunami> I've not played the game myself but I've seen it played before.
<Polydunami> killer7, that is
<MadSurge> Polydunami: but it would be great to see people's reactions to the game :D
<Lunacorn> holy crap erin has a ton of mods
<Polydunami> Yeah, all the shit that gets real.
<Lunacorn> and all of the mods are ponies apperantly
<Lunacorn> all 146 of em
<Jake> yea farmin sponges to make cybernetic stuff
<Petrified_Discord> Shit approaches an asymptote of realism
<Polydunami> Our fandom is a very creative bunch.
<cowvarkian> Jake: seems legit
<Jake> totally
<MadSurge> Polydunami: this
<Petrified_Discord> Lunacorn: If it exists, there is pony of it. No exceptions.
<Jake> at least i can send electricity wireless
<Lunacorn> Petrified_Discord: coool
<cowvarkian> Jake: through sponges?
<Jake> no with huge antennas
<Petrified_Discord> Lunacorn: Seriously. Name any game/show/genre
<cowvarkian> Jake: made of sponge?
<Jake> uhhm
<Lunacorn> Petrified_Discord: umm, what?
<cowvarkian> Jake: or with tesla like insanity
<Jake> i think they are made from building blocks
<Polydunami> They speak English in "What"?
<Petrified_Discord> Lunacorn: Just a proof that EVERYTHING has a pony version
<Petrified_Discord> Lunacorn: Actually foreign shows might be a bit obscure.
<Lunacorn> Petrified_Discord: umm... mario?
<Dashie_Dashie> swimmmmmmmmm

<MadSurge> Lunacorn: did you like what you saw? :$
<Ninjazz> Jaymoooo
<Ninjazz> c:
<Jmo> :3
<Lunacorn> MadSurge: I want to be a pony, if that answers your question
<TequilaShotz> Hey is ponysquare working for anybody else?
<cowvarkian> TequilaShotz: probably
<artist> Lunacorn: it probably sucks being a pony
<Petrified_Discord> artist: Lyra would agree
<Lunacorn> artist: go wash your mouth with soap
<artist> i mean a real pony, eat, shit, get ridden
<Lunacorn> artist: :|
<cowvarkian> artist: yeah, that wouldd suck
<Ninjazz> No it wouldn't.
<MadSurge> Lunacorn: Nightmare Moon is great!
<artist> being a mlp pony would have been awesome though....
<Ninjazz> No worries. Have a human idiot to take care of me, life would be grand.
<Petrified_Discord> Depends on who's riding you. *gets shot*
<cowvarkian> Ninjazz: so, you would want to be a dumb, non sentient pony
<Jake> being a equestrian pony is cool
<Lunacorn> i just realized that i opened tf2 two hours ago... and its still opening :S
<alexxm> the musics good
<Ninjazz> cowvarkian, and not have to deal with the world? Doesn't sound so bad, imo.
<Ninjazz> Unless you're talking wild ponies.
<cowvarkian> Ninjazz: you woulnt be concious
<cowvarkian> Ninjazz: you wouldn't be you
<Jake> oh now i remember why i startem my othe pc. i just shut it down because i didnt remember
<Ninjazz> cowvarkian, I'd be a pony.
<cowvarkian> Ninjazz: you wouldn't even be
<Jake> :P
<artist> sometimes i wish i was a cat, just sleep aaaaall day :P
<Ninjazz> You're looking at it from a human perspective.
<Ninjazz> Think like a pony.
<cowvarkian> Ninjazz: ponies dont think
<Jmo> PONAY
<Ninjazz> "Where the bloody hell is my food?"
<Ninjazz> "I hope there isn't any predators near by."
<Ninjazz> "Humans are stupid."
<infernap12> it loops!
<Jake> what would be a pony predator
<Lunacorn> well erin is talking the comp now
<cowvarkian> for one thing horses are idiotic animals
<Ninjazz> Haven you seen sheep?
<Lunacorn> so bai for now
<artist> Jake: cannibal!
<artist> sheep must be the most retarded creature
<Jake> canibal pony! run for your lives!
<artist> EVER
<Petrified_Discord> You know what's odd? Ponies are usually drawn to be cute and donkeys to be ugly. But in real life ponies look uglier than donkies. :/
<cowvarkian> artist: yeah they are pretty dumb
<Petrified_Discord> *donkeys
<JRP> NewSuperBronyU|Zzz: hello
<Ninjazz> I like horses.
<Petrified_Discord> Ninjazz: Fine equines
<artist> cowvarkian: scared of umbrellas.....
<Ninjazz> Not crazy about them, but they're cool.
<JRP|Zzz> Im not sleepie <_<
<Jake> and suddenly the game turns into sky serpents
<cowvarkian> artist: did you know that if you lay a horse down, and cover it up, it'll think its dead
<Ninjazz> That horse is loyal as hell.
<MadSurge> Night JRP|Zzz!
<Petrified_Discord> Congrats horse. You're the new Rainbow Dash.
<Jake> that horse is applejack as hell
<Ninjazz> Seriously, there is a sky serpeant flying close to the ground and all it does it wait for it's stupid human master to get back on it.
<artist> cowvarkian: so they are extremely retarded?
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: Agro is best pony
<Ninjazz> its*
<cowvarkian> artist: yes, horses are fucking idiots
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, I agree.

<cowvarkian> brony2447: maybe
<cowvarkian> brony2447: what is it
<brony2447> cowvarkian: Lasso by Pheonix

<cowvarkian> TheMaster: yes
<cowvarkian> Spell-of-Gaming: because its an old game?
<TheMaster> old games can be pretty boss
<cowvarkian> TheMaster: ikr
<TheMaster> most of my favorite old games are tough to stream though
<brony2447> damn cornhead passed out

<brony2447> cowvarkian: he was the guy who was on asking questions
<cowvarkian> brony2447: ah
<brony2447> cowvarkian: just ask Petrified_Discord
<cowvarkian> brony2447: ok, cool
<TheMaster> it wouldn't be accurate since not all of my games are from steam
*brony2447 is playing tf2
<cowvarkian> if only I could find the value of all the games I've downloaded on xbl
<infernap12> infernap12: $1405.50.
<cowvarkian> all that drm
<cowvarkian> just sitting there
<TheMaster> as all old games do this one reminds me of baldurs gate.

*AdamTheDuck slaps cowvarkian around a bit with a large trout
*cowvarkian gets slapped into submission with a larger trout
<Spell-of-Gaming> Anyone can ask me anything
<Spell-of-Gaming> I'm really bored
<cowvarkian> Spell-of-Gaming: you're welcome
<TheMaster> do you like ankle socks or ones that go up your leg a bit?
<Jake> If friendship is magic what is love
<Lil_B> I slept to long!
<cowvarkian> TheMaster: ankle
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Lil_B
<cowvarkian> TheMaster: well both, it depends
<TheMaster> and how do you feel about the ones where theres a little gray spot so you know where your heels go
<Colt_Brovakiin> Good morning Lil_B :)
<alexxm> how've you been Lil_B
<cowvarkian> TheMaster: they're silly
<Jake> If friendship is magic what is love?
<Lil_B> hey AdamTheDuck Colt_Brovakiin and alexxm :)
<Spell-of-Gaming> Jake: Love is technology.
<TheMaster> good good. Though spell-of-gaming was the one asking questions.
<Jake> interesting
*Ninjazz greets Lil_B with a hug.
<TheMaster> or asking for asked questions
<OtakuTom> Oh, never mind...this is #15, Argus
<cowvarkian> Jake: love is chemicals
<Spell-of-Gaming> Because, you know, online dating
<TheMaster> do you put the milk in the bowl first or do you put cereal in first? spell?
*Lil_B Ninjazzhugs Ninjazz
<Spell-of-Gaming> I put cereal in first. :3
<cowvarkian> TheMaster: cereal
<Jake> Love is made from love atoms. because science
*cowvarkian is going to do SCIENCE
<Lil_B> which colossus is this?
<cowvarkian> Lil_B: one of them
<TheMaster> how about ketchup. Do you make a seperate spot for your ketchup or do you just douse your fries with ketchup and pick them up already pre-ketchuped?
<Jake> Is your coffee with milk or sugar?
<OtakuTom> Lil_B, this is the 15th colossus, Argus
<Lil_B> cowvarkian :|
<Lil_B> OtakuTom thanks
<Spell-of-Gaming> TheMaster: Seperate spot.
<cowvarkian> TheMaster: who needs ketechup when you have potatos
<cowvarkian> *ketchup
<TheMaster> this one doesn't look like it'll be difficult
<cowvarkian> TheMaster: ikr
<TheMaster> so whats the heroes problem with the collosi? Did they beat him up and take his lunch money in school?
<Colt_Brovakiin> aim the laser at his balls!
<DaringDerpy> it's slow
<DaringDerpy> easy prey
<cowvarkian> TheMaster: he's trying to get his dead girlfriend back
<TheMaster> by killing giant monsters?
<cowvarkian> TheMaster: and a demon asked him
<DaringDerpy> necrophile?
<TheMaster> oh okay
<cowvarkian> TheMaster: but the demon's going to fuck him over in the end
<AdamTheDuck> DaringDerpy, lolwut
<TheMaster> if he can kill giant monsters like that, and the demon can't, why doesn't he just kill the demon in the first place?
<cowvarkian> TheMaster: because plot
<Spell-of-Gaming> The demon's going to rape him?
<Lil_B> DaringDerpy no , in that case he wouldn't care to bring her back to life :P
<cowvarkian> Spell-of-Gaming: no he's going to turn him into a demon
<cowvarkian> Spell-of-Gaming: or something
<Spell-of-Gaming> Ah, okay.
<TheMaster> no john, you are the demons
<TheMaster> and then john was a zombie
<cowvarkian> Spell-of-Gaming: I don't quite remember
<Lil_B> taste the light!
<cowvarkian> taste my shiny sword
<cowvarkian> that glows for some unexplained reasn
<cowvarkian> *reason
<Jake> it glows? must be orcs
<Colt_Brovakiin> Sorry but I am new to this hole thing, what is the laser beam doing? :P
<DaringDerpy> so someone told him when he slaughters these things, he magically gets his gf back...
<DaringDerpy> seems legit
<Spell-of-Gaming> Glowing swords are cheesy
<cowvarkian> DaringDerpy: yeah
<Spell-of-Gaming> Rusty swords are where it's at.
<TheMaster> say that to stannis baratheon. glowing swords are boss
*Spell-of-Gaming is being hipster
<cowvarkian> DaringDerpy: and apparently him and the girl are the last of his kind on this planet
<TheMaster> stannis is the dragon rebo..wait, wrong fantasy series
<OtakuTom> It's not that the sword glows or anything. It reflects the light from the sun and exposes the weak points of the colossi.
<cowvarkian> OtakuTom: that makes much more sense
<cowvarkian> OtakuTom: and I'm being sarcastic if it wasnt conveyed
<OtakuTom> Plus, it's a fantasy world, suspend your disbelief :P
<Ninjazz> ^
<Malavolent> Inb4 jump.
<DaringDerpy> send the last one of his kind on a suicide mission
<DaringDerpy> problem solved
<cowvarkian> OtakuTom: fuck suspension of disbelief I SHALL FIND ALL THE FLAWS
<OtakuTom> GERONIMO!!!
<Lil_B> due, I suspend my disbelieve enough in reallife
<Lil_B> due*
<Lil_B> dude*
<Spell-of-Gaming> Why did they have to make this on PS2, anyway
<cowvarkian> Spell-of-Gaming: because thats what was out
<OtakuTom> It got an HD remake on the PS3 long with ICO.
<Lil_B> Spell-of-Gaming because it was the most popular system in this generation
<cowvarkian> Spell-of-Gaming: this came out in 2005
<OtakuTom> along*
<DerpyMuffins> Hai everypony, more Caramel stream?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Hm, 2005?
<DaringDerpy> careful with these blood fountains...the pressure might destroy your eyes...better wear safety goggles
<Spell-of-Gaming> Wasn't the GC out by then?
<cowvarkian> DaringDerpy: seems legit
<Lil_B> Spell-of-Gaming yes, but not so popular
<cowvarkian> besides, this was published by sony
<Lil_B> oh, that explains everything than xD
<Spell-of-Gaming> I honestly don't understand why Sony and Nintendo can't apologize to each other
<cowvarkian> Spell-of-Gaming: for what
<cowvarkian> Spell-of-Gaming: nintendo being better than sony?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Er, no
<TheMaster> Nintendo has sort of ran out of ideas
<TheMaster> its just mario and zelda these days
<Malavolent> Guise wait, let me grab some popcorn before you start.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Wasn't there a console where Sony and Nintendo worked together?
<TheMaster> what happened to original titles and series that can also get popular and get 300 rehashes
<cowvarkian> Spell-of-Gaming: not that I can remember
<DerpyMuffins> Debate time
<XAX> PC master race.

<Ninjazz> Malavolent, that's the point. I don't. :p

<cowvarkian> Lil_B: elaborate

<Lil_B> http://www.howtogeek.com/127610/desktop-fun-dragons-wallpaper-collection-series-2/
<ValtheJean> 2,14 actually no, that isn't allowed
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's still a non-image link
<Lil_B> ValtheJean but, it's a non Video link?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the rule is non-image links
<cowvarkian> ib4 ban
<cowvarkian> *inb4
<DaringDerpy> obey the rules!
<AdamTheDuck> Lil_B, rules is actually "no non-image links"
<Ninjazz> Oi. He gets it.
<Lil_B> AdamTheDuck yeah, just looked them up again -.-
<DaringDerpy> we have no rules about punishment :(
<alexxm|colt> we do DaringDerpy
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the rules about punishment are: don't break the rules and you don't need to worry about punishment
<cowvarkian> so, he dies everytime he kills one of those things
<cowvarkian> ValtheJean: thats strangely vague
<ValtheJean> 2,14 last collosus
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and now for an amazing ending
<Ninjazz> Dear lord I hope it was worth all this madness.
<cowvarkian> Ninjazz: it wasnt
<TheMaster> madness?
<TheMaster> THIS IS SHADOWSOFTHECOLLOSUS
<DaringDerpy> bad architecture
<Lil_B> Ninjazz he won't get laid :/
<Ninjazz> Lil_B, aaaawwwwww.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 cowvarkin that depends on how you interpret the world/mythology
<Ninjazz> THIS IS LIKE LEGEND OF ZELDA ALL OVER AGAIN.
<AdamTheDuck> ^ XD
<OtakuTom> Time to go after Malus, the final colossus
<Lil_B> Ninjazz it's dangerous to go outside alone
<alexxm|colt> was this made by the people who made ico
<cowvarkian> Lil_B: take this
<Ninjazz> Lil_B, he's got that horse with him.
<Ninjazz> And my bookmarks are a bit out of order for me to properly respond. :/
<Ninjazz> So no funny picture responce.
<cowvarkian> It's not safe to go alone, take this.
<Lil_B> I think I even have the Soundtrack to this game, the composer hat a strange name, Cow Otani I think
<AdamTheDuck> Mooooooo
<Lil_B> Kow*
<Kandarihu> Ah, color
<TheMaster> you know, the theme song of berserk fits suprisingly well with this game
<cowvarkian> Lil_B: that makes more sense
<Lil_B> I know I love the Final Boss Music, has a really really slow pace as far as I remember
<Dark_Horst> JUMP
<Ninjazz> Hey Val, is this all open ended? You can choose which one you want to kill first? Or is this broadly linear?
<cowvarkian> Dark_Horst: >_>
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the latter
<Ninjazz> Ah. Makes a good feel of being expansive at least.
<Lil_B> xD
<Ninjazz> I mean, Goddamn look at all this open field.
<Lil_B> Ninjazz I bhet i'ts nopt so big when you are a Colossus :P
<oni_link> Whoa, is this Shadow of the Colossus ?

<Ouroboros> Thanks.
<Ninjazz> You can't just fucking kill off the best character like that.

<Dark_Horst> it'S amaziing how he can climb while jumping
<Kammerjunk> cowvarkian: I'd say "It'd be a shame if something were to happen to it," but it's already dead.

<ValtheJean> 2,14 stupid clunky ass jump mechanic
<Ninjazz> Long way down...
<cowvarkian> TheMaster: hah
<cowvarkian> I wonder how many times val will die before he kills this collosus
<Kandarihu> Ah, so it quicksaved at the beggining of the boss battle, and restored you to full health. that's good.
<SpeccyRush> Ninjazz: enough to have to take a breath on the way down
<Lil_B> that ewas close
<Ninjazz> SpeccyRush, damn near.
<oni_link> I dont remember but did this game ever get a sequel ?
<cowvarkian> oni_link: why would it
<HavokOC> Eyo
<SpeccyRush> Ico is the sequal
<cowvarkian> oni_link: what is there to follow up on
<oni_link> cowvarkian: well not like a true sequel , I mean more like a spiritual successor
<cowvarkian> SpeccyRush: Ico came before...
<Ninjazz> Both look rather similar in terms of style.
<SpeccyRush> cowvarkian: yeah and this is supposed to come before it which makes this the prequal
<alexxm|colt> so whats this colousus supposed to be a tower?
<TheMaster> its on top of the tower
<cowvarkian> SpeccyRush: I'm fairly certain that the two games aren't actually connected
<cowvarkian> SpeccyRush: and that shadow is a spirtual succesor to ico
<TheMaster> spy!
<oni_link> ah, well that makes more sense cowvarkian
<OtakuTom> Ico was first, then came SOTC (developed under the code name NICO, a combination of the Ni (Japanese for 2) and ICO), and now they're working on The Last Guardian (code name Trico, Tri for the word "three" and ICO)
<oni_link> I mixed up ICO and this game
<SpeccyRush> cowvarkian: Shadow of the Colossus is considered both a spiritual successor[43] and prequel to Ico.[8] For several months during and after the game's release, the game's director and lead designer, Fumito Ueda, maintained that the game's status as a prequel was simply his personal take on the game and not necessarily its canon nature, as he largely intended for players to decide the specifics of the story for themselves, but he con
<SpeccyRush> woops
<cowvarkian> SpeccyRush: cool story
<Ninjazz> Dat copypasta.
<SpeccyRush> very funny
<cowvarkian> SpeccyRush: I found it so
<SpeccyRush> not helping Ninjazz
<SpeccyRush> no more pics for you
<Ninjazz> Sorry. :c
<Ninjazz> D:
<oni_link> OtakuTom: any word on the release date for that project?
<XAX> ¬_¬
<TheMaster> so close
<cowvarkian> SpeccyRush: and just because the lead designer said he thought it was a prequel ,and not even because of canonical nature, then how would that make it a prequel
<OtakuTom> I don't think they've announced one yet. It's been in development for a while, though. Hopefully it's not much longer.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 this is the prequel to Ico
<SpeccyRush> Last Guardian
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the ending shows that
<oni_link> I would love to see that and I hope it comes out soon
<SpeccyRush> thank you
<cowvarkian> SpeccyRush: you're welcome
<oni_link> I have to get all of these games, and a PS3 :( next year hopefully
<Ninjazz> well... atleast my heart's not going to be under alot of daaww related trauma any more. :c
<Ninjazz> I'll miss it so, though.

<Dark_Horst> these things are big, but they dont seem very smart
<Ninjazz> This collossus is like "I don't even know what's going on."
<cowvarkian> I don't think blood flow works like that
<DerpyMuffins> Most Collossus are peaceful
<TheMaster> it does when you're that big
<cowvarkian> TheMaster: you sure?
<TheMaster> are you an expert in collosus biology?
<Dark_Horst> i dont htink thats blood
<ValtheJean> 2,14 now for the amazing ending
<cowvarkian> TheMaster: are you?
<OtakuTom> Who's to say that the colossi don't have unnaturally high blood pressre? XD
<Dark_Horst> these things dont look very roganic
<Lyra`> ValtheJean, good morning

<Ninjazz> SpeccyRush, nope.
<SpeccyRush> Ninjazz: http://derpiboo.ru/131324
<SpeccyRush> only because
<SpeccyRush> its Luna
<Kandarihu> You'd think they'd have to put blinders on those horses just to prevent them from chickening out at those heights.
<cowvarkian> Kandarihu: one might think that
<Ninjazz> Ooooh. She looks rather slender, but I like his style of coloring on the mane.
<Saturn> 08,01morning all

<Ninjazz> SpeccyRush, He did good work aside of the rather empty foreground. But I'm not complaining.
<oni_link> hehehe
<Saturn> 08,01except for maybe when i think of how i smelled that day when i smelled the way that i do right now, right now

<Kandarihu> So, would his weakspot be in the knees?
<Lil_B> there is no way to change anything here
<MadSurge> ^
<Ninjazz> So this is a wait to die moment?
<Lil_B> yes
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: mostly

*RainbowPie keeps Lil_B warm, Problem solved :D (im not doing your work for yout though :p )
<Colt_Brovakiin> Heya Ponies47 :)
<JRP> i got a reply
<JRP> how odd
<RainbowPie> MadSurge: theres that, But my other confession is that rainbow dash just happens to be best pony
<DerpyMuffins> You're a Collossus Thou
<Kandarihu> cowvarkian, most, but not all.
<Ninjazz> ¬_¬
<MadSurge> RainbowPie: I disagree, but it's your preferences :D
<Ninjazz> Holy shit does this guy ever get a break?
<infernap12> how does one pick best pony, i just can't fo it
<RainbowPie> MadSurge: haha i know you do im just kidding, because spike is best pony....
<cowvarkian> Kandarihu: so what, which religion isnt bad
<MadSurge> RainbowPie: :D
<kirzstryfe> good morning everypony :)
<infernap12> *do it
<XAX> oherro kirzstryfe

<DerpyMuffins> Hai kirzstryfe
<Lil_B> I though Vivi is best Pony is part of the rules
<oni_link> ^
<alexxm|colt> how are things kirzstryfe
<cowvarkian> spike is best pony
<Lil_B> hi kirzstryfe
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's not a rule, it's a fact
<Snow> Discord is best pony
<Lil_B> ValtheJean that too
<Ninjazz> Tis a good fact.
<MadSurge> Aaaaand destoyed
<TheMaster> spike is best rainbow dash
<Ninjazz> A fun fact.
<MadSurge> *r
<RainbowPie> ValtheJean, Lil_B sorry but spike beats Vivi

<cowvarkian> TheMaster: spike is best rainbow dash
<Lil_B> RainbowPie no, he doesn't, thats a +3 Fact
<Snow> no wait, a changeling is best pony
<Ninjazz> SpeccyRush, the only thing we can look foward to.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I'm not the one committing heresy
<cowvarkian> ValtheJean: herresy is fun to commit though
<oni_link> heresy most fowl
<RainbowPie> ValtheJean: everyone has their own opinion :p
<cowvarkian> RainbowPie: thats funny
<Lil_B> lol opinions
<cowvarkian> RainbowPie: you've apparently never been on the internet
<Ninjazz> Well at least all that stuff he did wasn't wasted.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 except when it's fact. Either accept your crime or be forever a heretic
<Snow> opinions are overrated
<MadSurge> OH, so NOW she decides to resurrect for no adequate reason
<cowvarkian> ValtheJean: I'll be a heretic
<naturesfury> no Queen Chrysalis is best cause she can be ANY pony. so she instant wins
<kirzstryfe> correction, Chrysalis can -look- like any pony
<Ninjazz> Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. No matter how wrong.
<RainbowPie> ValtheJean: Hey im just playing around :D
<Dark_Horst> Ninjazz: hitler had his own opinion too
<Ninjazz> And he was entitled to it.
<DerpyMuffins> Here comes the sad part
<cowvarkian> so, we're talking about hitler now, eh
<Ninjazz> Why in the name of bloody hell does Hitler ALWAYS come up in this kind of conversation?
<oni_link> I love when these debates over best pony emerge :3
<naturesfury> the horse lives!!!!
<SpeccyRush> and Godwins Law envoked by Dark_Horst

*applejack268 thanks cowvarkian for telling her whats going on.
<cowvarkian> applejack268: you're welcome
<artist> guys, i am back
<kirzstryfe> Last Guardian has been on hiatus for years and the creator left the dev team, but Sony won't admit that it's dead because they'd take a stock hit from it
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the upcoming ending proves two things (or at least implies), 1) this is the prequel to ico, and 2) the Dormin was not entirely evil
<applejack268> hehhe
<cowvarkian> applejack268: >_>
<Ninjazz> Dormin is the protag of this game?
<applejack268> so ut we doin after this thenw

<Ninjazz> So the voice in the guy's head?

<artist> Lyra`: more like 9001
<Jake> because f*ck logic
<Snow> Dat range.
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: in season 1 she was too subdued and quiet. In Lesson Zero she did a pretty good WORST POSSIBLE THING scene :D
<Snow> TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON!
<naturesfury> what song is this?
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, she's done us Rarifans proud.
<Jake> because japan
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: so far I hate only Big Mac's VA :D
<Lyra`> N O P E when i disagree, im macalicious
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, nothing gets me laughing more than Poland's VA for Applejhack.
<Ninjazz> Applejack.*
<Ninjazz> Get out of the way, other window.
<artist> so, what are you guys doing?
<artist> chat? chat! live!!!
<Jake> EVAs are cooler
<Lyra`> why is this supposed to be a good game if all the robots one shot the enemies?
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: AJ's and Fluttershy's italian VAs... are the same person :D and they sound nothing like each other!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 how are you supposed to be a good viewer when you complain about content you don't like?
<MadSurge> ^
<naturesfury> hahahahahahahahahahha
<Lyra`> :3
<oni_link> boom
<Jake> someone should suggest evangelion for movie night
<Lyra`> it just seems like theyre overpowered, ValtheJean
<Ninjazz> You can't expect much from kids nowadays.
<DerpyMuffins> You got told Lyra`
<Lyra`> also, according to you, im not a good viewer T-T
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that's what happens when you're on your 23rd playthrough
<naturesfury> ooo there gurrren laggan
<oni_link> SIMON??
<MadSurge> Lyra`: New Game + benefits. He's working to unlock Hard Mode
<artist> whats the greatest candy ever made?
<Lyra`> oh, i seee, MadSurge
<artist> this games so...so japanese
<MadSurge> Lyra`: he needs special points that you get only by ending missions successfully.
<Ninjazz> >23rd playthrough
<Ninjazz> ...
<naturesfury> teirra was so op i swear
<MadSurge> Robots require dedication :D
<MadSurge> ValtheJean: was the first playthrough hard?
<DerpyMuffins> So op
<Snow> inb4 reply
<ValtheJean> 2,14 very much so
<Lyra`> ValtheJean is cheating with his prior experience
<DerpyMuffins> Lyra` is the only one I seen mouth off to the mods
<Sonny> Lil_B: hey there
<Sonny> =D
<Lyra`> the mods know i love them
<Ninjazz> Oh you've seen nothing yet, DerpyMuffins.
<Lil_B> hi Sonny :)
<ValtheJean> 2,14 she thinks we don't pay attention to what she says
<Sonny> Lil_B: I'm gonna do the live-stream again in a vew second, want me to share you the link?
<alexxm|colt> how've you been Sonny
<Sonny> in pm then
<naturesfury> my god these guys talk sooooooo much
<DerpyMuffins> Which you dont most of the time ValtheJean
<Sonny> good alexxm|colt :)
<Lil_B> Sonny ok, anyone else there?
<Sonny> not yet still need to open it
<ValtheJean> 2,14 just because I don't respond to it doesn't mean I don't see it
<MadSurge> naturesfury: it's anime robots, talking is a free action :D
<Lyra`> im really not worth paying attention too, most of what i say is either 'flirting' with someone, or a sexual inuendo.
<Sonny> you can invite people if you'd like
<Sonny> to have conversations etc
<Lyra`> not very good conversation matterial :D
<ValtheJean> 2,14 which is exactly why you're getting closer and closer to another ban
<oni_link> ValtheJean: that sounded like a PSA for bullying lol
<Snow> i like this game alot, for what console is this?

<DerpyMuffins> Bad excuse Ponies47
<Kandarihu> Sumica, that was a prominant source of conflict in children's cartoons and folklore ever since I was a little kid. It's only graphic if it ACTUALLY happens, which is NEVER the case.
<DocSane> I think it's time for that girl's cartoon now. :)

<TheMaster> you're outside the target demographic. would you rather they advertise the latest R rated movies and the next season of game of thrones?
<cowvarkian> TheMaster: yes
<oni_link> haha
<kirzstryfe> they wouldn't advertise GoT, wrong channel :p
<Ninjazz> J_E_Smith71, If you could, it would be much appreciated.
<Pikachu> ive had enough of game of thrones
<Squallken> id love more game of thrones referances
<Jake> idk but they could make them better
<ValtheJean> 2,14 TheMaster: welcome to Bronyism, the egocentric clusterfuck where people forget the show isn't catered to us

<TheMaster> so she's herself?
<cowvarkian> TheMaster: yeah

<DocSane> You gobble things by swinging?
<cowvarkian> DocSane: apparently
<Snow> why would anyone believe this?
<artist> is that princess molestia in the lower right corner?
<Snow> nightmare moon was deafeated.

<DocSane> artist: Fancy Pant's trophy wife/girlfriend.
<J_E_Smith71> Excuse me for a second...
<BladedWings> even zecora's like "i'm outta here"
<artist> oh DocSane i remember her
<oni_link> please ping me when the commercials are over
<artist> disney channel sucks
<TheMaster> or you could mute it
<cowvarkian> artist: the cartoons are ok...
<Squallken> HUB > Disney channel
<TheMaster> woah hold on. they're putting leelo and stich on the same plane as the rest of the disney classics?
<artist> cowvarkian: but everything else....
<Domo> Squallken: I like how you think
<TheMaster> i call shennanigans on that
<oni_link> TheMaster: I did, and have a separate IRC client.
<Snow> PURPLE
<oni_link> and tabs
<TheMaster> L&S is good. sure. but its no jungle book
<Squallken> thnx
<naturesfury> haha..
<DocSane> TheMaster: And why not? It was one of the most popular of their movies in the last 10 years.
<Sumica> 00,10oh god how many of these pet things will they make
<Domo> >seat pets
<DocSane> Seat Pets...?
<cowvarkian> Sumica: all the things
<Domo> thats just like the teddy belt
<Ponies47> Sumica: They will make pets for everything
<Domo> i won't use the real spelling
<TheMaster> because you know what seatbelts need is an annoying large cushion on it to aggravate ansty kids
<Squallken> ah im not used to watching commercials :(
<DerpyMuffins> Are americans this dumb to buy something like this?
<naturesfury> i call toliet pets nexted
<Jake> oh god i had one 12 years ago
<cowvarkian> DerpyMuffins: yes
<artist> Sumica: enough to for every kid iin the world and more
<cowvarkian> DerpyMuffins: we are
<TheMaster> again, these commericals are meant for LITTLE KIDS.
<DocSane> DerpyMuffins: No, kids are dumb enough to beg their parents for these.
<TheMaster> they are not meant for adults
<Sumica> 00,10before I went live they had hoodie pets
<Doctor> hello everypony
<Ponies47> DerpyMuffins: Yes, us Americans are all idiots
<Jake> hallo Doctor
<TheMaster> the idea is kids badger parents for the items they want, and the adults give in and buy them. thus the marketers are making them appealing to little kids
<Ponies47> Hey Doctor
<DerpyMuffins> What's up Doctor
<artist> Ponies47: poor you, living in America...
<Snow> batman is scary....
<TheMaster> its just a doctor, its not -the- doctor
<Snow> yeah right.
<Sumica> 00,10that ad was short
<naturesfury> so ya when i think kids movie i think grimlins...
<DocSane> We're all idiots...with the world's largest military and nukes, so don't make us mad!
<Squallken> was that batman mask of the phantasm?

<Ponies47> oni_link: You can never go on one of those servers and not hear that quote :P
<TheMaster> further funfact. thee's and thous are actually the informal version of 'you' and 'your'.
<cowvarkian> DocSane: totally

<oni_link> Ponies47: I know haha
<DerpyMuffins> Who was Nightmare Moon's VA?
<Snow> dat face
<SafariMonkey> hi cowvarkian BladedWings and alexxm|colt
<Squallken> "god damn it PINKIE" that should be a motto

<TheMaster> so if you've ever studied english or latin. with its formal/informal references to other people, english is always formal
<Sumica> 00,10Same VA as rarity

<naturesfury> i swaer that dog looks familiar...
<artist> oni_link: i can pings you :3
<RaveBrony> Rarity the skunk... :(
<naturesfury> somwhere
<Sumica> 00,10hub's newist show using pony VA's in an attempt to lure bronies to more markets
<DerpyMuffins> Is trivia banned Sumica?
<Snow> tinkerbell...
<oni_link> artist: if you dont mind :)
<TheMaster> they already tried that with carebears though
<SpeccyRush> dat retcon
<Ryunosuke> uhh
<oni_link> Sumica: marketing ploy indeed, I will not fall for it though
<TheMaster> it was a one of a kind thing. the perfect storm to make MLP popular.
<Ryunosuke> kinda cold for slurpees
<DerpyMuffins> Dat no name brand
<DocSane> Or perhaps they use the same VA's because it's easier that way.
<artist> who doesnt want to die in a horrible slow freezing death?!
<Sumica> 00,10not banned persay but tends to encite alot of spam
<J_E_Smith71> Probably doesn't taste the same as the real thing
<ValtheJean> 2,14 >implying everything else on the hub is automatically bad
<Doctor> https://plus.google.com/u/0/photos/109057955388579800288/albums/5755167248301274929/5802258643923995202 thats so me
<DocSane> I doubt Brony fandom really figures into their plans for Care Bears and LPS.
<TheMaster> a few things made mlp what it is today. Specifically a unfavorable review about the show before it came out. It thus garnered the interest of /co/ who watched it. What started out as just ironic amusement at high production values became...this
<The_Engineer> >Implying that Implying is not Implying
<Snow> dat implying
<Pikachu> implying got rome destroyed in a year
<DerpyMuffins> Imply-ception
<TheMaster> certainly a long way from 2 years ago
<Squallken> out of boredom i made a "top 10 mlp:fim episode list"
<Doctor> YAY!!!
<Ninjazz> Thing is, it /could/ be good.
<artist> oni_link: "
<ValtheJean> 2,14 a long way down, yes

<Sumica> 00,10no they are not beting on it DocSane, but they do considder it
<DocSane> God, has it really been two years?
<Ninjazz> But it feels like we're being exploited, and I don't like that feeling.
<TheMaster> yes. I remember when episode 3 came out
<Doctor> zombie next year?
<oni_link> yay
<DocSane> Twilight Sparkle uses lecture!
<the_real_pony_1604> dance party
