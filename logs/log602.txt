11,02Pokemon on a plane? That's a federal offense.
I figure black and white should work on the 3ds... It came out before 3ds right?
Blame Nintendo logic.
That confuses me
SuperBrony64, you do know the 3DS can play DS games...right?
A-MERI-CA!!!
of course!
11,02Yes, but it looks like crap.

Night, everypony. I need to sleep.

/me gives SuperBrony64 a cookie. More south park, my friend?
Crimson_Phoenix I don't think it exist
Crimson_Phoenix: ? wuh
Dken2021, oh it exist alright
Crimson_Phoenix: It was fake
Hello everypony! ^^
hi Emmie
was it Ponies47?
hai Emmie
Want suggestions SuperBrony64 ?
ello Emmie
Hi guys.
SuperBrony64: i agree with Crimson_Phoenix. i have to see the brony ep, too.
Pinkes4thWall: There's a brony episode? D:
I don't think the brony episode exists
K, night everypony :)
I just see that making such a worse impression of the community. :<
nighty Dr_Fumbles
Crimson_Phoenix: Rumor had it. It was gonna be the Season premier of whaterver season it was (15 I think) they we're wrong.
Oh dear.
It's going to be like some infectious disease thing.
THERE IS NO BRONY EPISODE OF SOUTH PARK
Ponies47, what was the title?
Or they might take the weird fetish route.
I seem to remember hearing about one... :S
:(
11,02There's a brony episode?
SuperBrony64, it seems not
SuperBrony64 Apparently there will be? o.o
Crimson_Phoenix: y u strt so much hubbub?
don't worry , I doubt matt and trey would even think about doing it
oh im definitely sure theyll make one
Pinkies4thWall, cause I was interested in that one time I saw something about it
SuperBrony64: Can you show another show? :P
im sure it will be very disturbing
theyll run out of ther stuff to reference eventually
didn't know it was a rumor
and mlp is hella famous, so theyll undoubtedly do it eventually
if south park does a brony episode...i dont know what to expect
I have a solution to the "there's no brony episode" problem
SuperBrony64 play me song
Who cares whether or not they make it we've gone through worse and besides South Park makes fun of everything
So, I ate an oyster on saturday.
how was it?
Take the Chinpokomon episode, replace every word of Chinpokomon and anything related to it as pony. Done. :3
Spell-of-Gaming genious
Dken2021: Quite yummy. I like escargot, too. :)
so what's going on?
dat boop
Spell-of-Gaming: there was the Japanese thing tho
Spell-Of-Gaming, You realize they could turn it into some weird fetish
:C
SuperBrony64: will you be doing youtube requests anytime soon since they were cut short due to the podcast?
But whatever, at least we can laugh at ourselves
yeah, if only south park were funny..
lol
whats going on?
I have the solution to the Japanese problemn
?
Spell-of-Gaming: rreplace Japan with Usa?
twilight_sprinkle: That and...
Replace the Japanese words with Kawaii desu

You need to!
SuperBrony64: <3<3<3<3 REMEMBER TO GET THE jump Ball mod! You MAY miss it even if you complete the game
Creepy music is creepy D:
I have so many good memories of this ame.
Emmie: Just wait :D
11,02There's only two Metroid games that I've beaten. Metroid Fusion and Metroid Other M.
SuperBrony64: O_O
Wait don't spoil it!
SuperBrony64....I feel sorry for you
SuperBrony64: You are GOING to love this! Just focus ont he game, DO NOT TALK TO US DURING THE GAME! Got i!?!?!?
I beat Contra Rebirth the other day!~ So happeh. ^^
You know I forget. How old is SB anyways? :P
SuperBrony64, Have you played any of the Prime Trilogy?
oh cool im playing metroid right now :)
Emmie did you beat it on nightmare?
11,02I played this game for a bit though :3
SuperBrony64: got trilogy?
those two are the easiest and most weak games of the metroid series
SuperBrony64: could i tell you some cheats :3?
11,02I'm 22 O.O
Pinkies4thWall: he doesnt sadly
Dken2021 No. ;ono
SuperBrony64: Ah
Crimson_Phoenix: Dude...
Crimson_Phoenix: Fusion
Fusion is linear
Crimson_Phoenix: Is the second best Metroid...
SuperBrony64 dont u pussy out again
11,02:<
SuperBrony64: Me too! :)
/me pokes SuperBrony64 's similar age
and scratch the whole exploration
11,02wub ^-^
It had a nice story though
I'm sure SB will do his best
11,02I've played the Prime trilogy...never really beat it yet though :/
/me Wonders who's the oldest and youngest bronystate mods
unlike Other M
But yeah SuperBrony64 .... Ignore the chat, focus on the game or youll miss out
Wub Wub
SuperBrony64: O_O
/me still needs to beat metroid prime
11,02Other M was my favorite Metroid game personally :)
/me was born 2 October
Metroid Prime 1 was the best :3
I'm the youngest mod, Ponies47.
SuperBrony64, was it because it was easy?
I beat 1, 2, 3, Prime1, Prime 2, Fusion, and Zero Mission.
11,02No :<
I beat. EVERY Metroid game, EXCEPT Other M
Prime 3 is hard to beat =/
How old?
I beat Other M
Heck I even beat HUNTERS for god sake
i wanna try metroid prime 3
nice
o u :P
:O holy wow
Vordox, oh god Hunters
17 now, was 15 when I joined the mod team.
Can you wall jump SuperBrony64?
I actually forgot about that one
Crimson_Phoenix: So yeah... Trust me, Fusion = Second best Metroid :P
since it's so horrible
Why does this person put exclemation points after each sentence?! They must love to yell a lot!
Vordox, Hunters is pretty much the only Metroid game I haven't played.
welp, samus just landed on a space station, $10 says it doesn't blow up
Heheheh.
Hunters seemed like an awesome game for DS
Vordox, I wouldn't say fusion being the second best
/me Is 14
;)
Honestly, I rate the top 5 like this. Super Metroid, Fusion, Metroid 2, Metroid Prime 1. Metroid 1
11,02Does it have something to do with the 'baby' since she kept mentioning it every 5 seconds in Other M?
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2: it was
I mean we have Super Metroid and Metroid Prime
SuperBrony64: AS I SAID; focus on the game, IGNORE THE CHAT
SO HOW MANY OF YOU GUYS CAN ALWAYS FLIP IN THE AIR WHILE JUMPING.
I still say Fusion was weak
11,02Dari is 17 and mah waifu already.
The first time I ever called Nintendo customer support and info, their hold music was an ad for Super Metroid. It just started with "SHE'S BAAAAACK!" and ended with the audio of a boss battle.
baby
SB64 just dmg yourself
Good thing about that game though
NO WAY
:O SuperBrony64 you pedo
the horror ambience and Nightmare
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2: And this is why I told you to NOT read the chat
Kick his butt!

Vordox has a point.
:D
On noez! I dropped my gum gotta go back!
This game is about EXPLORATION
Well, he has time. It is possible to get out of there in 20 seconds.
And you do that YOURSELF
^
I agree with Vordox
and Fusion wasn't about exploration :P
nah
Ponies kept me up until 2AM. I'm off to bed. Night everyone.

save the baby metroid
SB always trolls =/
Who desiged this place I mean did they expect everypony to have strenght increasing armor?
lol
and yeah I knew it was too good to be true
Crimson_Phoenix: I liked it for it's Story AND the f''cking monsters. Remember Baby Voice? =P
I thought you played this before. I would've thought you'd make it past Ceres
Vordox, Nightmare
11,02i liek dis game :3c
and I agree
Crimson_Phoenix: Indeed.
O_O
SIF YOU STOP PLAYING
WHAT IS THIS
Give up? WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH SUPERBRONY64?!?
taz eh? I sorta remember this
but Vordox that's still meh-ish to me
LOLWAT ^^
supperborny pls
I think Derpy is playing
since for me it wasn't really metroid
GOTTA GO FAST
Sanic
I wonder if there's a similar fail scene for the end of Super Metroid.
no wait, I don't remember this
UH OH
Santanic
Crimson_Phoenix: Super MEtroid for it's exploration and new world <3 With details. Fusion for it's Story and fleshing out Samus' character, Metroid 2 for it's UNGODLY Metroid history, Prime for the world information and it's atmosphere, Metroid 1 for the very first big thing
wth
ily Vordox.
SUPERBRONY64 YOU ARE RELLY GOOD AT THIS GAEM
Good night and Good luck SuperBrony64
wtf?
11,02Later Daygon :d
Is this like catching the purple dragon impossible?
nighty Daygon
11,02:D
So much murder in this game :D
Vordox, and I just go with Exploration as my number 1 factor
SuperBrony64: I AM JELLY
Crimson_Phoenix: Fusion had exploration too. :P
Vordox, it was basically GO THERE
Just that it was stricter then Super Metroid
and DO THIS THERE
Is this like catching the purple dragon?
Less ways of screwing upt the planned line
Crimson_Phoenix: Story in metroid with was decent = Good :P
And heck, we learned of Zero Suit Samus in that game
Not to mention the final boss <3 My god what a shock that was
Look Vordox You can't change my opinion about mine
I'm not
i dont get this game what do you do?
I'm explaining why I love Fusion :P
11,02TOO HARD
and I do see why you list yours that way
haha, rolling green hills in outback, lies lies!!
4th Wall broken
lol
Wait..
WAIT
oh god, tht was so hard
SUPERBRONY ARE YOU PLAYING ON A SNES?!
I understood
11,02Vordox: Yesh :3
I remember that scratch on the tv when you shut off SNES
._.
wow Vordox
that detail
Vordox: you old
:P
Oh shut up, I'm only 27 =P
I remeber my snes always not working
:D
I remember THE FLASHING BLUE SCREEN from the NES
I was playing games on my NES back in the day
HECK EVEN A VECTREX
sometimes it was brown
Most of you don't even KNOW what that is
other times Green
I even had Purple once
now that was fun
You know what's fun Crimson_Phoenix ...?
Kick HIS ASS
Power Reset blow in the cartridge part of the NES?
Crimson_Phoenix: Remember the "Scripted talk" in Megmana X Egoraptor part?
About bos health and stufF?
boss*
Make Ridley your BITCH
I'll need to watch it one more time
Also "Unable to help/save/beat something, and with Larva as the victim?)
00,10heheh, suddenly reminded of streaming aliens
I love this tilt
11,02I beat the game :D
It really does remind me of Alien, and not the sequels
IT THREW MY GOD DAMN MIND OFF
yay!
lol
11,02i liek metroid :3c
SuperBrony64: <3 I would kiss you if you were a girl :P
Next Planet: Zebes!
Also Crimson_Phoenix did you ever play Metroid 2?
11,02o/////o
Vordox, I'm sorry I haven't
00,10on aliens Kandarihu, I played the excape theme in the background when Riply was runing from the nest.
I heard about the metroid phase though
Crimson_Phoenix: Take a look at a video of it
Crimson_Phoenix: Dat game IS exploration
right now?
BIG bucking time exploration
Nah :P
Lateh
left SuperBrony64 -_(\
Sumica, I know. I would've been the only one complaining if I weren't honorbanned.
11,02OH
and exploration like in Metroid?
11,02okie :3
Also, the larva comes from Metroid 2, which caused me to love the Super Metroid even more
but in platformers, you're suppose to go right
00,10Some how I am not supprised
Is like Castlevania minus the demons and Dracula
Now you are jus trolling everyone Super Brony :P If you ask for people to help you we'll ruin the game for oyu
FECK IT! I'm pushing my stereos to the max for the music and SFXs.
I'm not even the biggest complainer anymore, though.
Vordox: man just the atmosphere right now its just...
morph ball
Spectrum_Rush: Increase the stereos and listen....
damn
Vordox: way ahead :S
who's streaming
oh no
hehe
witch one is this
Gee, Samus' visor is flashing. I guess she's doesn't have any epileptic tendencies.
=/
11,02Super Metroid :)
bob, SuperBrony64 is streaming
00,10Oh is this going to be a super pretends like he dont know how to play game?
ah
I'm still waiting for Tallon IV to blow up anytime soon

11,02Hey...
Probably Sumica :P
11,02Don't make fun of me Sumica ;~;

Sumica, you must've come in just now.
gc
SuperBrony64: Down down right down left right up up up left up right down right right. There you go. :P
Earlier, he pretended to get stuck on the escape from Ceres station.
/me nostalgias again
The ending
11,02Vordox: Dat didn't do nothing ;~;
SuperBrony64, Sillyness might be fun here and there but there are games that it doesn't work
SuperBrony64: That was the guide on where to go unless you wish to break the line of game already :P
Gotta love it when a video game sequel takes you back to the ruins of where the first game took place.
oh i have this on wii fun game still havent betten it on a count of one certain boss that remains to be a pain in my ass
thegt90: Marinia boss?
Maridia*
/me this JUSTIN i BAILEY remember where to go in this game :S
idk some flying bug one
Maridia?
SuperBrony64 trolls us all
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Flyung Big one...
Bug one.. Flying..
.... Normal enemies? :P
Spectrum_Rush, the Justin Bailey code goes into the first game.
yay morphing ball!
11,02Morphing Ball?! Wow, those are sold out in every Toys R Us across the county :D
I think I will write a fanfic called, "My best friend is a clopper"
grabs hold and just starts killing me
SuperBrony64, lol
lt me see if i can find out about it
11,02Uh oh...security camera
thegt90: The statue?
11,02I didn't steal it ;A;
Kandarihu: ah yes, but there is a hcack for Super Metroid that does a similar thing
11,02How do I release it?!
THIEVING VERMIN!

Run damn you
my laptop heats up so much i bet i could fry eggs on it
Spectrum_Rush, ah, I see.
thegt90: Grabs ahold of you... A flying bug... Boss...
And not in the water, So it's not the Maridia Boss
YAY! SuperBrony64 is a TERRORIST WITH MISSILES
Alright. SuperBrony64 clearly knows what he's doing.
he does?
So ...many secrets I am seeing.
<3 100% this game
yes he does
SuperBrony64: dat waste
00,10oh right this is that metroid guy I loved this game
>use 5 missiles to get 5 missiles
Wut
Well, they're more like rockets than missiles.
that's why I cringe everytime he's pretending to be stupid
So many secrets in this game many of which drive some peeps insane
this one http://i33.tinypic.com/1z4yagy.png
11,02You get an expansion of 5 Missles :I
MASF123: X Ray solves about 80% :D
SEECREEETS
/me pokes MASF123
ALL OVER SECRETS
I SEE THEM! In my third eye! :D
Vordox: Secrets, Secrets Everywhere
thegt90 protip: let it grab you, and use the grapple beam on one of the circuits, it will fry it quick
What the hell Pinie, that was my good eye. :[
So SuperBrony64 ... How does it feel using a SNES controller again? :P
pinkie
00,10they realy should make a FPS of this game
11,02I always play on my SNES :3
11,02Sumica: O U
oh i see thanks
Sumica, Metroid Prime
thegt90: That IS the Maridia Boss :P
thegt90: Yeah, let it grab you aim your grap gun at the wall circuit = insta kills or 2 -3 hits
i think he was being sarcastic
SuperBrony64, don't you have this game on Wii? I remember seeing it when you're going through your SD card.
must of takin real good care of your SNES SuperBrony64 for it to work with out problems
thanks
11,02Kandarihu: Yesh ^-^
pirates, possibly from space!
/me smells piny
Told you....
...Why you go all the way back down?
Spectrum_Rush, NES and SNES are durable
>:
VERY durable
since they are made from Nintendium
If you focus on chat = You miss all the stuff and do wasteful things SuperBrony64 :P IGNORe THE CHAT
Crimson_Phoenix: that they are, but even the test of time will degrade things
right well I'm off need to recover from this loss of blood don't you know?
Vordox: thats not why he does it:P
Spectrum_Rush, true but still

Sumica, You pay THIS much?
pony_6049: It's worth it.. :P
00,10they would make a fortune off of SuperBrony64 alone cause he would buy them all again.
SuperBrony64: So, what was his reaction when you met him again? :P
11,02>>
11,02I spent $200 on the Wii VC Market <<

It's a trap!
Ah, THERE's the bomb

once you beat game once it allows you to play in the day time
00,10inb4 dari finds the first 7 from video but not the 8th
There are 10 locations, and 8 pages that randomly spawn, so he may find them in places you won't.
wait so what is the story about this game you just need to find papers cant he just walk off or something
That's how mit's done.
The tanks are around the other side.
Now don't turn around.
you really need to look around cuz those damn pages are small
i would have just run off like come on it has to become day once in the game ...right

just getting stuff sorted atm to move
05pro tip Quick_Thinker
05the SECOND
pro-tip from Wrek incoming badassery
05they are delayed
05email them
?
05and keep emailing them
ohyou mean welovefine
05otehrwise your delivery can take up to 3 months
05yes
05WLF
how will i find out if they are delayed
and what do i say
05on the site it says that it takes about 7 buissniss days
this is my first time getting a site clothing so what do i say in the email
05if you orderstatus hasnt changed to shipped in that time
05its ratehr simply
05simple*
man ship dun got messed up
05you give them your order information
05the info got provided in the email they sent when you ordered
birthmarks aren't genetic...right?
05and then aslo say along the liens of "this is my order, why isnt itshipped yet?
so give them 7 days and then check the site to see if its shipped
05yeh
if i ordered 2 things will they ship seperately or together
05probably together
sweet i plan on taking both to Canterlot Gardens to get them signed :D
If I got a shirt, I'd probably just go back in time and get John Lennons siggy
the question is where i should have Tara Sign the hoodie
Noone elses is worth the time
Serenity what about Tara she is our queen after all
Quick_Thinker: Didn't you read my message? :S
no
:D
man this kid is catching on too fast
in the future toys kick flank
yet glue still fixs toys :o
its future glue~
well i checked the site and the order is still processing
oh i get it , the dead guy at the start is the clone ?
05mhm
where is welovefine located?
05us
there company that is
where in the US?
05dunno
hm time to do some research
i live in Indiana
so lets do some diggin
05atleast you live IN the US
but if thats the case , why does the dead guy look like adult trip ? does the clone not grow older than the host ? will flux trip up ? (dat pun)
05for me ovcer here
05it takes considerably longer time
05trip is in a coma
05they grew a clone using that symbiot
05sim is that clone
huh now that im think i probely should have gotten the derpy backpack but i am more of Twilight fan
DUN DUN
/me slaps Quick_Thinker around a bit with a large trout
stop that
yes , but at the start of the episode there was dead trip , i suspect thats the clone , question is then why does it look like dead adult trip , not like dead old age trip . i thought the clone lives trough hisnatural lifecycle
huh did not know Trixie was sci fi kind of pony :D
today i made the most unsal stament today
05he wasnt dead
05he was hurt
05and put in a coma
yes , but this is flashback after the funeral scene right ?
Trixie when did you get into sci fi ?
05what funeral?
at the start of the episode , i might be totally off , didnt pay all that muchattention
Wrek: before the intro
his memories are full of ponys he has a good chance
DEDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
bass cannon XD
is it getting rusty or something?
05covered in magnetic dust
flew into a shitstorm , now its crusting over
but then youll decelerate
your in a cloud theres material to collide against
aha thats why
wrek ban me for a hour
thats.... odd
05he is a very odd fella
sabotage incoming
i wonder what happens to the clone once he reaches the coma point , will he fall into acoma aswell ?
05nope
05casue the coma isnt casued genetically
but wont he just grow so old he will turn to dust?
05mhm
or just die from old age to be more realistic
neither are memories like the ones hes getting , but the way thisis presented hes gonna get coma memories, and might psychosomaticly be affected
05i dunno
smoochyboochy
05i guess the memories are inprinted in a way some how and were copied over when they took the sample to grow him in the first place
/me slaps t'pal upside the head
stop interupting science!
lol
im voting for the best pony on we lovefine i've been through 200 fluttershys MY ADORABLE METER CANT TAKE IT ANYMORE
05there's your funeral
hes pretty much at his own funeral
odd
so he has none of the memories of him from that
clone probabl deleted all his porn as a little revenge
that pizzas pretty fresh for being in the bathroom overnight
erm...
this is song...
*this song...
ok wtf ? xixis on earth ?
is it just me or does the ending music seem better suited as the opening theme
05i dunno
hookers 0.0
whores in my star trek
i can see why this had some low ratings
:$
ok i suspect timetravel , cause this looks way too shitty to be post warp earth , even early post warp earth
0.0
are we sure this is star trek
first time watching star trek, VERY bad impression
me too
although i saw the other episodes but with out the into ho would i even know this is star trek
dat whore
RAPE
did it really need a suitcase?
there was barely any money!
lol, that's what i was thinking
was that someones holodeck fantasy
logic : D
05fyi
05thats basically the timelord
how are the aliens even having any money ? and a warehouse ? on earth !
05but human
05too much backstory for me to explain so it makes sense
what are we watching
OH, can we watch dr.who later?
what are we watching
some star trek thing
stupid time travel without the doctor
yes take the alien to pre warp earth
i don't see how anything could go wrong
what could possibly go wrong?
Zawan the alien whos species was interferring with our development for a LONG time
and then the silence shows up
still...
and pushed back development at warp by at least 100 years
you didn't answer her question
you should think that they would be able to use technology which is totally outdated from their own :P
its like drivers ed all ovr again ARGGGGGGGGGGG RAGE CRUSH KILL DESTROY 1.0 to hte 2.0
they've like...never seen a car...thus they don't know how to drive one
hmm
lol jump in the car with a stanger
supply nearing depletion with 60 years left of supplies and a growing consumpion rate ? hardly makes sense
oh god, the trekkie line...
i have a problem with the stream showing up
you don't say
it says sorry the requesed channel cant embedded on this domain name
glennglog22, whats happening instead?
glennglog22, opera user?
Reason: Domain protection enabled by broadcaster.
no
google chrome user
what browser?
strange
that happens when you have referers disabled
normally google chrome would let it work
its common for opera users who turn it off for some reason
do you have firefox installed?
no. i have only 2 browsers.
the worst one
and the good one
internet explorer 9
any extentions installed in chrome?
vulcan neck pinch
nope
neck pinch XD
just flash and java
Reason: Domain protection enabled by broadcaster.
not behind a proxy?
vulcan nipple twist
nope
oh dear god....
well something is turning it off
vulcan crotch kick
how do i re-enable referers
on chrome
i'm looking that up now
ok
try ctrl+f5, might be a once off issue
5 finger pressure point heart explosion technique (vulcan)
ok
(just died)
3 bad things happened today. I found out my mate HATES ponies, My mate got hit by a car, I lost my drivers liscence.
lol :P
you hit him with a car didn't you?
Greg(the vulcan)'s 5 point presentation on finances!
i'm back, how did they get into the 21st century?
Marsh Kinda ruining the joke there mate.

In other news I am starting to get less sick.

I'm hungry now
hi everypony!
hello
Greetings
how you doing glennglog22
been awhile since I woke up this early. What's streaming?
wait.... how'D he do that
Wrek is
good
guess what?
That guy seems really nice
Because so far I narrowed down that it isn't Star Trek Enterprise or Quantum Leap
I have considered working in a fast food resturant. AFter creepily loitering around at one for a few days looking at bother the employees and the customers. I think If I worked there I would put gurn my face on the oven from the stupidity I would be surreounded by.
God my grammar suck ass
unless it IS Enterprise and therefore...why are you streaming that?
guess what?
I've worked in a fancy restaurant. it sucked
[Alpha] Sorrounded by snobs?
Needles. Ugh
flutter_spin: it is enterprise and he'S streaming it because fun
I've never seen it
i got a iphone 4 today!
No surrounded by people who did not progress in life at all. Very depressing
flutter_spin I unfortuanlty know where you could have potentialy gotten that name from... I'll never click on a random link my mate sent me via emal EVER again. :'(
Ummm I don't want to know :S
im scared....
[Alpha] No, No you dont. Trust me.
looks like someone had their first run-in with meatspin recently
/me gets shot right at the belly and passes out
Dark_Horst Kinda... More poniefied though... Still HORRIFYING!
oh not this again. No, TheRandomkid321. It isn't that. Sheesh, must people think its that?
now i'm curious
:|
/me wakes up at the hospitle
i didnt know something like that existed
meat spin is so 2003
flutter_spin sorry. I ddint say thats where you got it from but I said it could have been where you got it from.
I thought "Fluttershy" and "Sonic Spinball"
thats barely even soul scaring anymore.
:|
i've become immune to stuff like that
TheRandomkid321: i dont suppose oyu still have the url?
I still cannot listen to that song anymore.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_Spinball I loved that game by the way :P
Dark_HOrst I would get banned for posting such a thing.
you spin me right round?
And no I don't
I love that song
TheRandomkid321: pm
just google it
TheRandomkid321: you know you can do that, rightß
Dark_Horst I dont have it and I have no intentions of finding it
Dark_Horst No actually I dont
i tried google. only results i get are on youtube
you won't find it on youtube lul
and nothing even remotely horrifying
why don't you just try adding a .com to it
you sure? i find alot of things terrifying
TheRandomkid321: right click on the name in the list in the right hand and open query. for future reference
I don't
...or just double click the name, Dark_Horst
or that
I still have 0 intentions of spreading such horrifying material
its not that bad
^^ good
I've ignored more people that way
there are worse things out there.
oh no, it has a penis, it's a sin against humanity
TheMaster: it's never that easy
how horrifying
:|
Its fluttershy though.
mostly what weird me out is their skin color.
its a weird sort of yellow
Fluttershy should NOT have a penis
but maybe thats just bad resolution
so yeah, does anyone have a link to that? i wont be able to rest until i know the truth
there we go
Wait how da buck did the chat come to this state. Oh as usual it was my doing.
google it
doesnt work
what did you type into google.
This only happens when I login the morning too
I tried it, it was the first link
Alpha, ha
made me laugh
:P
dont worry wrek
TheMaster: location probably. google com references not the same as google de
TheMaster: but if you found it, care to pm me?
lol okay
Well I got to do something to help
*sigh*
COuld someone PM it to him already. I dont wanna
05stop talking about meatspin already
could you have this conversation in a p.m That would be much appreciated
In other news, my fanfiction is still waiting approval. Roughly 3,000 words completed.
but i'm getting so hot and bothered
whats it about?
Huh, guns of iccarus is not only getting a party system soon, but also should be getting custom games
COuld this convo just end already. I guess I technically started it but one message turned into a chat changer. Why does that always happen to me?
Like I said: "Not this again"
no worries, it already ended
oh... found it
it's not THAT scary
So what number episode is this?
Good. Now we shall never speak of this again.
0512
05i run 1 dvd around this time
god didnt know pokemon online was so hard to figure out
...
aw. I have like an hour before I gotta' go.
cow334 whats it like
Wrek do you have another series planned for this?
after this*
alexxm: it's like pokem,on but online you can make your team and stuff and play with people around the world it is pretty cool to tell you the truth
05TheMaster: well dari is the one playing dr who.
I've heard Enterprise was the worst, but I wouldn't know. I moved across country while it aired. I think Voyager was the last I saw.
05im thinking dexter actually
is it free cow334
05the first 2 seasons were meh
woo, dexter. And I know, the name and all, but I do happen to like other stuff
05the second 2 were actually good
I actually really liked season 1 of dexter
alexxm: yes
05i was replying to flutter_spin regarding this breanch of star trek TheMaster :P
ahh
Everytime I hear pilgrimage, I think Mass Effect
Yay the quarians
I am so addicted to TF2. Is there a help group for that? God my cousin would utcher me If he found out I was playing a game like that. He utterly HATES valve.
I like valve
whats he have against valve?
I mean, maybe it makes sense to be mad over their recent change to the EULA
What class do you play in tf2?
oh no. It's one of those episodes
I was gona take a nap yesterday. i ended up sleeping for 6 hours :S
TheMaster Well his brother is int he military. His great grandfather was in the military. He has grown up around military knowledge. He hates any ANY unrealistick FPS games. Like COD. He like gams like Battlefield more.
He hates L4D too
I dislike Battlefield
05so he is so wrapped around realism he cant enjoy games
05then i ask
That doesn't make a lot of sense to me, personally. TF2 is cartoony on purpose.
TheMaster I usually play as scout.
05why should his oppinion matter.
Well, I'm not big on FPS. I liked Halo & Unreal Tournament. The rest... eh
battlefield isn't really all that much more realistic then anything else
Unreal Tournament 2003. GET SOME!
oh man, a game is differnt that reality
if he wants to get mad over bad realism he should focus on strategy games
how shamweful
Wrek well no. Just alot of games that are really unrealistick about war and guns really. It's odd.
05show him arma 2 and 3
He liked RDR.
Who cares you can only go so far with realistic games
05if he still thinks BF3 is more realistic
he'd like Arma if he had a good enough comp.
Though don't show him Mod Z
He doesnt PC game really.
05then you can officially call him out on bullshitting
Wrek yeha I guess.
TheMaster He would like the Day mod. Despite being zombies not much else in unrealistick about it.
Day Z
dont show him DayZ but thats the best part of that game
Dat unrealistick
I wish my computer could handle arma so I could kill some zombies.
:O
No wait with Arma 2 he would get annoyed with the AI. Apparently Its horrid.
thats why you play multiplayer
I'm thinking of getting a PC for gaming. Mayby I could get Arma 2 and go zombie hunting ^_^
05i dont like playing tf2 the boits are dumb
05bots*
05its a simmilar argument
05now you realize how bad it sounds
Wrek I play online. And yes the bots do suck. hell anyone would think they where bing controlled by a COD kid playig the game.
Medic is always my favorite personally
I play as medic a bit too. MY spray is a girl dressed up as a nurse leaning over saying "She wants you to be a medic". Because hardly anyone is ever a medic.
what a dick
his guy an asshole
As sppn as I got TF2 i put pony mods into it
soon

Hey everypony!
FREAKING TERRORISTS!
...
05hes not a terrorist
05hes a fundamentalist
I wish there was a video game like Aurora that could let you recreate star trek/space exploration.
that was more user friendly, I mean
My cousin hardly ever plays xbox anymore. He is too busy gold digging. Literally. He lives in a gold rush town and he has found a quite a bit of gold. It's a smart idea. Well. Smart for his brain. No really he has got a small problem. He can speak and function fine but he fails at even basic math.
this is what you get for being kid to otehrs

TheMaster, called Starcontrol 2 (aka Urquan Masters remake)
So one ship will end the war?
Add ALL the ponies
Sorry. I was busy looking at http://www.starshipcorporation.com/ - Sort of a Spaceship creator with mockup drills. Looks really neat.
Aw
Oh i've heard of that one.
:)
Yeah. Urquan Masters recently went free.
ok, the remake is free. The original game used to cost
But I was more looking for a grand-strat sort. Like Galactic Civilization but more indepth
Wait. What was that one game that streamed here awhile back?
oh man it's like The Crusades in spcae
I am addicted to twilight VS the walking... Damn you stairs

Run out of bullets? Throw the gun!
They need a Bass Cannon :P
Shouldn't they... weren't the weapons offline just a moment ago?
flutter_spin: if you switch something off, you can usually swithc it back on again
But the enemy would have saw the weapons were offline earlier
that
that's why they stopped rnning and fired back again
oh snap
that green screen
dafuq...
So they had war without them?
peaceful aint it?
:S
seemed pretty peaceful to me
and self-genocide ftw
and this is how you bring peace to the world
Just a minor detail I got confused with in the plot. Nothing to worry about.
and, daawwwww sleeping filly luna
awwwwwwwwwwww
:3
that's a weapon?
thats no weapon, its a...wait no, its a weapon
wow. That's a lot of stuff that happened last time on Enterprise
I don't remember any of it :P
Oh hai everypony......Star Trek enterprise, right?
He sounds familiar
05he is also the prime vorta for the dominion
hahahhaa
05he also acted several klingons and other aliens
That's great.
it's like full house intro in space
LOL
I always tell my mom that Hollywood is running out of actors so they 'recycle' them in other programs
Buytoast Except, that this series <---- has a plot
but it doesnt have bob saget
Buytoast which it's the main reason it was Sooooooooooo successful
:S
These guys don't like humans, I see
flutter_spin: They must be the bad guys.....
hey i watch full house all the time shut your tongue
DUH!
bob sagets sharp wit
gary coleman's catchphrases
uncle jessie's chisled jawline
I was trying to figure out a time when someone hated humans but was the good guy
Buytoast: Hey, it's not that i don't like it bro, i was being sarcastic
I remembered something, but no idea what
dun dun duuuun!
cooooool
Looks like a Borg effect

last encounter? did that go well?
05yeh
05humans have acted as meddlers between those two races
05species*
From what i can tell guess Full House has a smartly-written plot and heartwarming stories filled with humour.
oh shit did the smurfs and the snorks have a wild party or something?
I* guess
wow. So from his little chitchat... Vulcans are allies but haven't done anything. Earth is - under attack? in trouble?
That, or he's a Smurf in disguise
05it drew a line through florida
05killing 7 million
ouchies
I just haven't seen that much of Full House, but from what i can tell, it was a great series
they dont seem to care very much
or have they already done that.
05the final weapon is suppsoed to be done within a motnh

Child's Play is an organization that works for toys and games for children that are long term hospitalized, you know.
Love Filly Luna sleeping next to Twilight :D

05alexxm: id liek to know too
05sounds like a perfect B movie
its a space ghost
the spoookiest of their kind
I wonder, if Star Trek is supposed to be our future, then why are there no ponies?
^^
We're back on earth having fun
'fun'
Did I miss anything. I went to look up how to make my own desktop pony. It's pretty easy and all I need is photoshop
Tervicz: Simply said, the producers didn't see bronies coming :D
05well if you are trying to follow the series on stream
hehe
so why is everyone asleep?
space fungus?
Wrek, you just stream these randomly during day time? I tried to follow this series a while back but enver saw the last season
[Alpha]: I doubt you need photoshop, you could probably get away with Inkscape or Paint.NET
one of those magic viruses?
So- yeah would like to try again
Score!
It's likethey said in the Chronicals of the Riddic: Who could have calculated the possibility of ponies dominating modern culture?
Or something like that
Photoshop costs 1200 usd, or you can rent it. Otherwise, use something else
05Buytoast: sometihng to do with how human brains operate. being awake would casue damage to our rbains so they are put in an artificial coma of sort
I'm very familiar with photoshop so I would prefer that one
gimp
Buytoast: space anomalies make human brains go fryfry, so he put then in a cma
*coma
05phlox and tpol dont sleep or need rest in the same manner
ah
SAI forever :>
SAI is great, dunno if it's good for pixel edits though?
05i wouldnt say sai is good for detail pixel editing
Touche.
05isnt*
05wait
05w/e
hehe
i use photoshop and it works just fine
05its very good for drawing
^^
05but ppixel sprite art making istn directly its nieche
yeah- I enjoy it, cheap too
05gimp or photoshop seesm more suited
I would like to haev photoshop, but when I got my own bank account I stopped pirating things
Did I start something o.0?
Yarr harr fiddle do dee.
I don't think you started anything bad-
/me glomps Vivix
!
/me awkwardly hugs
is that SAI tool thing free or do you have to pay for it like i had to with photostop
:3
SAI costs-- 67 dollars at the current rate
goddamn
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2581/
i could buy food with that much
hehe
05then again sai does give you a 30 day trial
:D
http://www.systemax.jp/en/sai/ pretty cool
I'm just gonna use my ipad to make pixel art
you can use graphics gale
lolipad
its for pixel art and pixel animations
I tried Corel Painter first- but I bought sai instead, since I liked it more-
bah, i'll just stick with paper drawn scan traces
openCanvas is decent from what I've seen.
interesting species, those denobulans
Oh! I had forgotten about that program-
:P
Great I learned how to draw with my finger. Now I must learn to draw with a mouse. 6_9
Hehe- pixel isn't too bad with mouse, but anythign else is a hassle in my opinion-
^
Hey, does anyone here own a Intuos tablet?
05yeah intous 4
i got a wamboo bamboo tablet
I'm considering buying one- and was wondering if it was- rougher? Like the pen had more friction, like paper?
lolwamboo
bad cgi
It was a pain learning to draw with my finger because of the sensor in an\ ipad
My current tablet is very much like drawing with a felt pen or something- very slick
05Vivix:thats what the different tips are for
INSEEEECTS
Ah, great!
05the one i ues is a bit softer to casue firction
That sounds great- 'cause yeah the whole slickness has made me horrible at straight and smooth lines
Weevel would be proud of that bug
It costs a fair amount, but I'm sure it'll be worht it if I save up
That indeed it does.
grrr I'll kill this program with a cactus
Hehehe
What're you doing?
Forget it I'm going to use photoshop. For the record I know how to use in both windows and mac
You were trying SAI?
Forget it I got it
Okay, good good
she's a hallucination. wnna bet?
Darn I can only use the touchscreen on Microsoft paint
Dark_Horst: yeah, she's an hallucination. she doesn't touch anything
she also doesnt seem to know any more than he does
I think I remember this episode
I think they did something similar with Voyager
Except it was the ex-Borg chick
yeah, seven of nine had to steer the ship through a nebula on her own
Not even the doctor hologram could help her
helping illusions are a popular thing... they apear in a lot of series
i remember one in Bones
i doubt this illusion is helpful
it's calming to know you're not alone
or is it
or to think for that matter

Wrekrage
If one wants to turn off the stream, you hit popout and close the window.
05Eli
05you are mistaken
Capiche
Capeesh. If i was you,i would stream zombi 3 (1988)
star wars is fantasy anyway. not really ground for comparison here
no i totally understand you
05seeing me rage is something entirely different
I don't want to know-
D:
well now i'm afraid
Compare this with Texas Chainsaw Massacre
Wreck-It Wrek has come
wut are we watching? :3
i smell slight residue of trollium
comparing star trek to texas chainsaw massacre is idiotic though
I know
sonicandmario85: enterpise. still the xindi story-arc
08,01hmm
08,01you're playing from doovde?
:O woah
i see you changed the stream source xD

Well I just completely kicked everyone's arse in MK7, *Feels bad that he went MLG on 'dem randomers*
08,01maybe later i'll stream doovde of mulpfim
Stream is pretty laggy today, but with my shitty internet it's usually me
MIPS HATES US D: THEY ARE BARRELS
Sorry for all this rage.But i don't really like Star Trek
05noo need to be a total twat about it
08,01Dark_Horst: doovde! play in doovde player!

I will never be a total twat anymore.

Røverspråk..piglatin?
Hey do what i do when I don't like something. Either give it a shot or just mute the sream
GreeHetBronyInDuitsl: as mentioned, nobody keeps you here. if you dont liek what get'S streamed, we all beleive in the "shut up and bugger off"-policy here

Go clop to porn somewhere else dark_horst-
08,01yes, but i also have mulpfim in the huud
me too- I had CRT computer screen until a month ago
I still can't get used to how hard it is to get BLACK right on LED screen
08,01and lucudutuv is a huud too
05GreeHetBronyInDuitsl: that was uncalled for
i smell a twar
*twat
05now last chance stop acting liek a total twat
Morning guys
OK
OMG! is this alien?!
Tyler_The_Creator: enterprise
ffs.

I hate to say it but, this escalated quickly.
haven't seen Alien in ages....
Nah- it's only a problem if we make it a problem, Jmo4267

I will stop acting like a total twat-
well i have to go dinner is ready

LAter RainBowJack
>12:07AM
08,01wrek: fulommeh only has the 10 - 15 fips

Hi everypony :)
Hey MegaMoonShine
:>
how you doing MegaMoonShine
05strange it should be higher
I sense the ban hammer is coming
Good alexxm thanks :$
the site is back up
What's on the box?
I will never hate what you stream anymore. I learned my ****ing lesson
ah Star Trek
It's abo respecting the stream, not blindly liking it. Which is easy to do- I think
^
^^
I RESPECT THE STREAM
05no allcaps
Sorry
08,01oh GreeHetBronyInDuitsl, you just can't win...
Sometimes, every step you take is into a rake
I know
I like rakes.
something tells me this will keep going for a while
08,01we still <3 you GreeHetBronyInDuitsl
08,01well, wrek might now
08,01*not
Cool
Eew
space plant jizz
Or sometimes you take a step into a rake but catch the rake before it hit you in the face
05takes moer to make me dislike someone
Sometimes I like to read Wrek's chat in a Skyrim voice
05im more indifferent
I'm going to start a rampage!
Lol Vivix
stuttering for anyone?
That's a good mod attitude, though. Some --sites have really angry mods that start more flames than they put out
For me it is
*couch*4chan*couch*
it is for me too- but I'm on a 0.6mbps line
I know that feeling Vivix.
I'm just random but mostly quiet
I tend to write a lot-
I like to read alot.
When I first came here I got auto kicked a lot from my "hit enter all the time" steam habbit
why do they keep bringing up movie night
and besides, movie night is friday night
grrr the only issu I have in drawing is body structures
issue
Do you use circles and boxes?
that helped me a loot in body drawing
For once and for all,i wanted dutch movies at friday movie night. Just saying
I bet his attitude has somethign to with the egg
I'm not angry
why dutch?
no i try to freestyle
For a good reason
if you try just adding a few circles, you might find it easier to rotate the bodies and pose it the way you want, depending on your style
care to state said reason?
Reason:None
he killed the ship..
I still stick by that Titanic should be a nickname for bad ships or ships that end poorly.
That's what i did at the start but I disliked it after a while so I try just drawing it all without outlines
I have a reason why i want 1 dutch movie on friday movie night:Cause i like Dutch/French movies
Yeah- in art you shouhld do what you enjoy the most, what works for you
he's INFECTED!
Hope you are gonna make a new kind of movie night
He's becoming greener and greener
Who me?
no the captain in the stream
i'll make a guess: the stuff the egg sprayed on him is tapping into his brain and makes him develope protector-instincts
hello?
Hello Striker
Guys, is there a place to see or someone to ask what movies are on the trilogy week thingy?
Hello Striker :)
I guess I'll have to observe body structures more. i think the reason I can draw faces better than bodies is mainly because It's what I observe the most or enjoy the most drawing
Dark_Horst: that's what I'm thinking too
crispy critter
The gates of hell Trilogy
Vivix: The steam group usually posts what is going to be played during the week.
/me ate a random object
[Alpha]: I prefer drawing faces too- so constructing the bodies help me sketch faster
Vivix
Jmo4267: thanks- I'll have to keep an eye on that
No worries :)
Vivix: this week it's Pirates of the Caribbean and Indiana Jones
respect has been gained for captein archer
Vivix!
I always draw the face first but when I finish the face ....let's just say I don't look forward to the next part
/me is confused
doesn't he believe in showers?
Ah, yes. I was here last ngiht but fell asleep before Indiana Jones
Yes, GreeHetBronyInDuitsl ?
captain*
Next week on stream should be the gates of hell trilogy
Mm- haven't heard of that
Gates of hell?
Yes
/me pooped rainbows
I actually ment City of the living Dead
Ooooh
When I draw faces I usually use a blue and red sketching--pencil, so fun. I drew a Goatalope, I have to finish a drawing of her one day-
The movie from 1980,you know?
Mm.. I haven't heard of it- I don't watch all that many movies
/me made popcorn
:P
Because of the italian gore or the Director (Lucio Fulci)
There's only two movies in the space oddyssey thing, right?
hey everypony more bronys found on COD one named equestrian pony and ht eother called xsuperDerpy
Lucio Fulci <3
Quick_Thinker: :D
so far i also found a Twililicious
/me ate another random object
stop eating random objects you could accidently eat a grenade :c
Or a bug..
I almost accidentally ate a snail the other day-
or could some pony swag :C
My dad`s cooking taste worst
0,5You almost ate snails?
My cat had one on him, and it came on my hand and I wiped my mouth. I almost threw up
0,5ew
How do you accidently eat a snail
it was on my haand and I didn't see it
>__>
it was..awful
There is a purpose for your eyes :P
/me barfed on Vivix
and then they made out
it was one of those tiny ones-
hehehe
0,5Snails is worst pony
Let's make a Short quiz bronies!
Vivix: you should still try escargot :D
Hehe, one day I will- I think
/me pooped out a rainbow
They're not raw, right?
Vivix: of course not! :D
/me dries face on Striker
hehehe
Well- it sounds like it might be delicious, like mushrooms
look terrible, taste awesome
video paused?
Just kidding.
Vivix: they kinda taste like seafood, like clams and the like
Hm.. sounds alright
We call this Hell of the living Dead reference gone wrong :D
hehe
skipping much for anyone?
I ment Night of the Zombies (Italy 1980)
Skipping a bit here
/me puts on stealth cloak
Italian horror movies are either terrifying or hilariously bad :D
Good afternoon! My name is Spell Burst!
Hello!
That was almost ripped from TS xD
kill the captain
/me pants Spell
he's gone mad with power
of course he's gone mad with power
ever tried not going mad with power?
It sounds like- he's doing the right thing, but is going insane with that green goop
Doesn't work, no one listens to you
he's gone made with bug juice
French horror movies will be better or French dubs of italian horror movies are better
Hehehe
Simpsons the movie
Al..what's his name? The actor.
/me THE CAKE IS A LIE!!
MOO
and that guy is milking it for all the power he can gain from him
What do y'all think about what i said? :)
these people are dicks
I always said the cake was not a lie- we see it at the end ;__;
GreeHetBronyInDuitsl: why are yo utalking about french horror movies? 0.o
Whenever I watch this show I keep expecting Al to appear like Q and mention something about ziggy
I never thought I'd see the day when I'd get bored of lightning
/me is eating toast
Face the truth Vivix.
I don't want to!
The lie is comfort!
thats not good enough
I ment french dubs of Italian horror movies!
The lie is comfort that will fade eventually.
FACE THE TRUTH.
But, it will feel good for a whiiile!
/me set his phasers to hug
..Wait what?
an armed party escort team will be with you shortly
Now I'm curiouis as to what position that would be
How'd I get selected for this siitatuion?
situation^
05buck a tree in the banana position
Oh I see now.
killed the stream Wrek?
/me turned on stealth mode
Stream is still running fine.
still on here too
it just shut down for me...
05hit play
05its a known issue with limeV
But I like bananas they are full of potassium
Ahh
ah
Space balls
/me huge 60s cartoon wizard voice "Potassium Benzoate!"
Dem my balls
you got some nasty ball then
balls
talking to balls
HE FORGOT TO SET HIS PHASER TO HUG!!:o
Whenever I see bananas mentioned in a Celestia fic I get worried, even if I've never seen a trollestia comic
or..whatever that is from
Do you like bananas?
05i wonder if you could teleport antimatter
IMPOSSIBLE QUESTION
:>
hehe
05seeing as the science behidn it is that it deconstructs your molecuels and the rebuilds them somewhere else
well teleporters teleport matter
boom
I saw the video so yeah I get the joke. Also if you have seen two best sisters play portal two he is eating a banana
anti matter is like the opposite no?
05which is why i ask
I always want to get Arrow video releases of movies (Except House by the Cemetery and Gates of Hell (1980))
that pulse grenade wasn`t set to hug!:O
Yeah, I've gotten the joke by proxy, but I always get worried that it'll turn out tob e a trollfic
What is trollfic?
>_>
Like a joke..
the whole story is just a joke
?me has a troll face
/me has a trollface
better
He is feeling his balls
Space Mutiny!
They need more guardrails!
THAT PHASER WASNT SET TO HUG!:o
That sounds annoiying
annoying
Set that phaser hug boy
And last but not least: 5.Cat o' 9 tails 6. Dawn of the Dead (1978) 7.Day of the Dead (1985)
A phaser set to hug could potentially be used for self stimulation of an erotic nature.
or- a platonic nature
ie. "I want a hug."
/me licks Vivix
!

harsh
Same andy.
don`t worry you`ll just have a bad itch for a week :)

Nope it's 24 hours
A wise saying proves nothing. - Voltaire <3

"You wouldn't understand." I understand not to roleplay anymore!

oh goodie, the end
Red shirts live yet blue shirts don't? What kind of Star Trek is this?

Jmo4267 I told you i will never roleplay again

05becasue dari istn here to stream right now Flyboy

Wrek: awww...

Flyboy: sides, we've seent hat one a dozen times already
Buytoast: everyone! get him!
Dark_Horst: which one though, 11th doctor one or 10th doctor one?
10th, probably

town
Wrek: i'm not...
05everyone! get him!
Dark_Horst: yep thats the 10th doctor one
05i rest my case
also no one cares for matt smith B)
Wrek: it was a joke...
he tried to bully my soft person
That isn't true Dark_Horst.
05a shitty joke then
Wrek: Hypocritical statement is hypocritical :3
Wrek: why does no-one in bronystate understand what a joke is...
05eeyup
woah woah woah Dark_Horst
05im sure they do
jokes are fobidden ehre
05but I dont
don't you know that?
What are thine jokes you speak of?
Is it a type of drink?
it's movie time apparently
Serenity: its like whiskey, it gives people the giggles if its good enough
ikr Crimson_Phoenix
Well. I don't drink.
So no.
Steam lying to me :D
SUddenly Twilight
I came when I heard the trilogy event was starting
Nittany set the wrong time :)
05a bit early dont you think GabeMoist?
Pretty sure the films start at Midnight as usual
indiana jones?
05my guess is a missklick on the timer
GabeMoist: Not til 5 more hours
Wrek it was at 2 yesterday
Steam just said it started :D Came back to share my 'lol's
Wrek, not my fault Steam is spreading lies
Secrets and lies
lololol
05and i do not blaem you dear
Which midnight is that?
The midnight that is midnight at midnight.
There's a midnight every hour
I'm not going that deep.
/me sticks head out of bush
Midnight BST
Yeah, Steam just claimed the movies were starting. XD
But I don't know the BST timezone ;__; PST?
Huh? I am confused...
Jmo4267: we heard you liek midnight, so we put midnight in your midnight
BST = British Summer time
That's only 3 cycles, not deep enough. Baaad.
Oh, okay, that then its 1 am here
Basically 90% of europe is 1 hour ahead of BST
Hai Meanwhile
yeah-
Allo everypony.
*scratches her head in confusion* What is everyone talkinga bout?
/me drags Meanwhile into the chat
I'm used to british time being called GMT 0
Vivix|Awai: It's summer, so it's BST :P
Hence being called British SUMMER time
GMT8+ represent.
/me poops out Serenity
/me stabs Striker
oh yeah, but some measure it as GMT 0 in winter and GMT 1 in summer, or GMT 0 Summertime
/me respawn
And that's how you can't have children with a banana
as we are GMT 1 normally GMT 2 in summer or GMT 1 sumemrtime
Well, chat's confusing.
"Nearly two years after the game's release, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game is getting new downloadable content, which will add online multiplayer to the XBLA version of the game." :o
Steam said movies are starting- so- I got confused and asked about time-
CriticKitten: Blame EA
I miss Harry Potter already :l
Dat body
And the DLC has Wallace as a playable character? Brb, buying an Xbox.
:P
The notification was 5 hours early. lul
Haha
trippin
T'pol isn't looking so good.
I looked up Battlefield 3 on a site, and there's supposedly, FIVE FUCKING DLCS!
Abit slow there Serenity.
right now, nly one
CriticKitten, FINALLYT
hello everyone
She is always looking good
Bye everyone
hell o Meanwhile
Harry Potter was a great series, despite Harry not being the nicest guy, it was still fun
There is two currently. lolwat Dark_Horst.
the only one that might interest me so far would be armored kill
Hello Cameron
Jmo4267: I know that, but I'm someone who gives 0 fucks about everything, so I never bother to check what's new
Jmo4267: not in europe
ggeurope
Serenity: Touche my friend.
I only find out through people
i loved highway tampa in bf2142
What?
so yeah. tanks and giant maps? sounds fun
Oh god don't let this topic come to life.
/me half arsed "yaaaaaay"
Anyone know where I can buy a new copy of Spyro: YotD without spending a hundreed bucks?
HELLO guy,how is everyone doing today ? :)
what topic?
Hai sergio_scriptor
Spyro, the original?
Heeeyaaaaaaaaaaaa everypony!
05hai Zanon
AttacktheAndalite: Raise the price to 101 dollars, so you don't have to pay 100
/me waves and thanks AttacktheAndalite :)
lolspyro
Vivix|Awai: Yep.
Spyro was--awesome, I haven't seen any original copies in years
Spyro was alright.
Serenity: I only get 100 dollars every 2 weeks and that goes towards gas and the Internet.
Pay 99 dollars then?
^Homerun.
And then pay the one like 10 years later or something
You checked ebay and all that, right? and you want a mint copy?
Vivix|Awai: I only have the first game now. I don't play it anymore because I've beaten it 3 times already. I need to get the second and third
Ah yeah
Vivix|Awai: Yep, checked ebay. And for some reason when I try to order something online, it won't accept my card because of the security code on the back because it's VERY hard to tell what the first two numbers are
Ahh- maybe you should get a new one- I need to get a new one
AttacktheAndalite: Send me your credit card and I'll help you :3
About to go all pirate on them
Serenity is legit.
Vivix|Awai: If I could get a collector's edition I'd be happier but for now I just want the third...
Serenity: Lolol I'm alll the way in the US, and I don't think that's a good idea to send you my card info XD
you could have a friend order it for you? And pay them in cash?
Suddenly shower scene.
Smexy
oh yes
The Awai is a lie.
08,01vulcan boobs! \o/
Rape!
I know ;__; I'm supposed to be doing stuff
Serenity: True, but Australia also has dollars :3
knew it
Star trek?
Oh good grief.
NO LOVE FOR AUSTRALIA.
it's time to unleash the proton torpedoes
IT WAS JUST A DREAM
AttacktheAndalite: Also, I could tell though the way you speak
She need a hug
needs
A very Kinky Dream
Hey Everypony!
Serenity: I've been found out! *hides*
05note that trellium D is highly toxic to vulcans
Hello DerpStar
Hello, DerpStar
05and is the reason she is well simply put, goign insane
Wrek: The more you know~
how you doing DerpStar
lol Meanwhile
Great yourself alexxm ?
they turn to space zombies
crikey
i'm good DerpStar
Oh I remember this one
captain spock should stop now before she ruins everything
Serenity: That and my parents put money in my account till I can get a job and my mom checks it. She's very good with money and if something's up, she asks about it.
Dark_Horst: this is not Dead Space!
But yeah AttacktheAndalite I'd suggest you get a new card if the CVC is being rubbed off- remember that it's onl the very last 3 digits on the CVC you need to put into on online shops
I just finished watching an Episode of TOS
Hello.
MadSurge: they DO turn into space zombies. we saw that already
/me glomps Vivix|Awai "AWAI"
Wrek: isn't it another reason why she is going crazy, wasn't the trilium D thing n a n earlier episode?
hello Ouroboros!
I'm sorry ;__; I really am supposed to be rehearsing
Vulcan zombies are best zombies.
:3
Drugs
Then go rehearse >:c
Vivix|Awai: It shouldn't be rubbing off, it's kinda "engraved" in the card but not enough to show through like the long number on the front.
05trellium ore
But! Credit cards!
Braaaaiiiins...are the logical dietary requirement...
ah yeah-
*in another
REHEARSE
literal crack whore
Vivix|Awai: Actually it's more a debit card but I can use it for either or
...
Smoke that squee
crack head'
ah yeah, I have mine locked as a bankcard, so can't take up credit on it
HELLO MY Ponies
Wht are we watching?
08,01what are those rocks?
but they're the same numbers, I think
...did she just inject herself with liquid trellium d?
Drugs are bad, mmkay?
what is this?
ok
05Dark_Horst: seems like she did
I actually lost my card 2 months ago, inadvertedly saved up 1500 dollars and spent it all on music gear
Wrek: shouldnt she be, like, dead?
woona is sleeping
Vivix|Awai: Dang. Did you get a new one?
Loosing card = great way to save
Daygon: Star Trek Enterprise
Vivix|Awai: better then spending on cons ;)
REHEARSE. >__>
Not yet, but I got acces to my accoun via my mothers account- so I'm good yet
OK
05Dark_Horst probably
Vivix|Awai: Losing*
05unsure how it works really
Yes, sorry
>.<
DOGGY
I should call the bank tomorrow or--something
anyway okay, REHEARSE!
/me ditches muffs at Vivix|Awai
/me stomps big muff pedal
.....what?
How long is this?
40 minutes per episode
bigmuff is a fuzz/dist pedal, sounds dirtier than what it is
44 mins I think.
how many minutes passed by?
No idea
42 minutes according to itunes
But like an estimate
Hi again :)
They should set phaser to hug
Hai MegaMoonShine
More Trek?
Hai MegaMoonShine
Moar Trek
Hello MegaMoonShine, how are you?
pirate time!
Hello Meanwhile
It's 45 minutes
treeeeek
Uh sorry MegaMoonShine
I'm fine, AttacktheAndalite thanks
oooohboy.... they're gonna be evil
Space Piracy
Daaaaamn.
Because in my country, we have 5 minute advert breaks about 20 minutes in, then we do the last 25 minutes and have a 10 minute advert break
Renegade Archer
If the Prime Directive existed he'd be in so much shit...
and thus, earth became bullies of teh galaxy
Buytoast: >:3
I think I'm going to start getting into Star Wars. Good/bad idea, and any recommendations?
/me shines light in Alien's face
AttacktheAndalite: if you like scifi, why not? :)
AttacktheAndalite: only watch episode 4-6 :D
Star Wars < Star Trek
05i find both enjoyable
^
Indeed
^^
SO MANY SCI FI's that begin with "star"
But still I enjoy trek more
STAR GATE
STAR WARS
STAR TREK
Star muffins.
also, star wars isnt even remotely similar to star trek. just saying
05STAR SHIP TROOPERS
^
Oh how could I forget that one
Battlestar galatica
MadSurge: Well I haven't been much into sci-fi a lot but since Star Wars seems to come on at EVERY MINOR OCCASION on Spike TV, it's grown on me.
Star fox
Wrek: You mean Lagship Troopers.
Doesn't start with star, but it has star in it
GALAXY QUEST!
^
^ no
Yes
yes
05Meanwhile: i dont get the lag
I really dont get whats happening
:D
Doesn't start with star
05pelase explain
08,01i love pixelwrek's tail
isn't there a Movie that has both Star Wars and Star Trek Parodys in it?
scre stars
Wrek: When we showed it here it lagged for like, 3/4 of the movie.
Maybe so, but it is still a damn good filn
Meanwhile: you mean Star Expendable Troopers
05heh
Did you guys play Space Balls yet?
AttacktheAndalite: :D but do try Star Trek, it can't be so bad right?
08,01Lil_B: i know about it; i do it as a hobby
she's emotional?
Vulcan emotions>
trellium is getting to her
08,01Serenity: drawing
Daygon: in Movie Nights, yes
08,01i can't draw
I see
Yeah, but that takes alien knowledge
And crayons
She broke his iPad
GGG
08,01Lil_B: sure, what are ryou looking at?
:D
OKIE DOKIE LOKI
this is wy T'pol is going crazy http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Trellium
fuck ipads, everything on that ship runs on linux
DerpStar: Ikr :(
MadSurge: I might...I've never been much for Star Trek, admittedly. My parents and sister like it, though. I also enjoy the classic Batman.
Now now Spectrum_Rush
what its not running on windows Me?
AttacktheAndalite: you mean the campy one? :D
AttacktheAndalite: you mean the series with adam west or the movies by tim burton?
MadSurge: Dear God, you're calling it campy too?? :D My sister called it that last night?
Serenity: wha, it's relevant to wats streaming
Alchemist: The series with Adam West and Burt Ward as Dick
/me backs up slowly
moo
Alchemist: I mean Robin, Boy Blunder :x
AttacktheAndalite: I said campy, but it's still very enjoyable :D
lol
FUN FACT: Android runs on Lunix
I've always wondered, why isn't the trouch screen on the 3DS not 3d?
I was told never to get headphones for mixing
MadSurge: I rather enjoy it now. A few years ago my dad was watching it on TV and I was all "Wow this looks sooo boring." Now I watch it every time I visit my parents
Serenity I thought it is the touchscreen that is the 3D screen -.-
Her logic was seriously comprised if she thought getting high off poison rock was a good idea.
That would make it even more complicated, Serenity
Lil_B: Nah, it's the topscreen
comprimised*
hi
Meanwhile, well who doesn't like getting high off of poison space rocks? /sarcasm
Vivix|Awai why?
woot! my fanfic finally got approved like an hour ago
AttacktheAndalite: Klingons.
Complicated? I ripped out a touch screen from an old DS, and it looks just like what the top screen looks like ',..,'
hi Pikachu :)
AttacktheAndalite: :D silly is fun, and it doesn't ruin "serious" Batman for me
:)
They said the bass frequencies weren't getting enough space or something- I dunno, they just told me to get monitors instead
Well I'm more comfortable with moon rocks personally
lol. Still going on that same dvd I see, Wrek
dat Hyppocratic oath
05grats flutter_spin!
MadSurge: I admit, a lot of stuff I thought was stupid back when I was a kid I now enjoy, all thanks to bronystate. And that is 100% no sarcasm. Oh the things you think when you're younger.
Shouldn't she already be able to access emotions (I thought Volcans just suppressed their emotions and that they actually have stronger emotions than humans)
I'm assuming the touchscreen isn't 3D as a cost-benefit thing
aliens can't be human
what are you talking about
fluffle_puff: She's been getting high on toxic material.
I'm actually quite surprised my first comment was "it is over-descriptive"
das dum
cardassians?
das relly relly dum
I must be doing a good job.
sure, they could hack together another 3D screen and make it work with touch, but you don't gain much from it
damn, they evil
AttacktheAndalite: aye. Although I did have an eye for good shows back then too, I didn't realize it yet :D
desperate more like it
Are his phasers set to hug?
05Sundaysmile: i thoguth that first too, but no
13http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/674239main_PIA16001-full_full.jpg
Yes, but the way she was talking made it sound as if she never had them to begin with
So stephen king is known to write evry detail
moo
MadSurge: I never liked Power Rangers when I was a kid, probably because my brother would ALWAYS watch that when he beat me to the TV on Saturday mornings and he had a lot of Power Rangers action figures. It annoyed me.
Shizuka: aren't you happy that they managed to land it? :)
I hope they find Luna up there
Power Rangers are best pony.
My little brother watched power rangers but I had G1 ponies ^^
/me ...
yeah right... the Mars landing happened XD I forgot to check this out XD
That's cool Shizuka :$
ivan ooze was the greatest being ever
/me throws a pillow at Meanwhile "hahahaha no"
that bastard had some style
/me is pillowed.
But I like Power Rangers. :c
/me 08,01nuzzles Wrek
/me nuzzles back
GOGO MIGHTY MORPHIN' RANGERS
umm..
AttacktheAndalite: luckily I am the elder brother, and we both always enjoyed cartoon :D
Meanwhile: favorite series?
Meanwhile: Of course you do.
Spectrum_Rush: Mighty Morphin'. Ofc.
MadSurge: Sweet.
Meanwhile: good on ya man
I have come to a realization about the shows I thought were stupid when I was a kid :3
HIS PHASER ISNT SET TO HUG!!
IKR Striker
LOL
Vivix|Awai: Early brony!
it was a sign :D
AttacktheAndalite: and we almost always agreed on what was good and what was crap :D ah, the times when CN was still good
hehe yeaah
I still have it, under my screen
Always destined to be one of us!
Vivix|Awai you were ment to be and your grandmother knew!
It was set to bear hug
My little Brother would watch MLP with me G1
05fun thing Vivix|Awai
MadSurge: I miss old CN. Courage was my favorite
Hehe, it was fun to refind it when we moved, yeah
and dexter's lab and powerpuff girls
Oh I loved those shows-
Me too
AttacktheAndalite: I liked all old Cartoon Cartoon series
Pinky and the Brain
Favorite episode of Courage was the one with King Ramsey.
05i actualyl recall playign with the old MLP toys that used to be at my grandmas house
05she used to have a daycare
*rehearsing, plays LOW. About 1 note every 3 seconds*
Ah, that's cool
AttacktheAndalite: The man in gauze! The man in gauze!
strange how the world works sometimes , eh Wrek
I used to play with barbie dolls under my grandmas table
>_>
05msut have been
05atlaest more than 10 years ago
MadSurge: Raaaamseeeeeeeyyy~
08,01i remember seeing mlp toys when i was young, and i wanted one because they were really cute
I used to hit two rocks together and say "now kiss"
08,01must have been a G1
I never played with MLP toys when I was younger.
Never even watched the show. Too busy watching Digimon
08,01and i wanted to brushie brushie...
Wrek that would make you about 9 years oldright?
I recall watching some G1 when I was a kid and thinking "huh, this ain't half bad" :D
Inb4 those people don't get home.
05msut have been longer than that
05fuc ki cant recall off hand when she died... but it was 2 or 3 years before that
I bet some of these brony haters played with MLP toys when they were kids
I arrive just in time to see the end credits, lol. XD
Must. Resist. Enterprise and work on story
08,01G1 cartoons are nothing special, but they're not bad at all

08,01# i will touch this guy #
FOR MR T!!!!!
she was like "HOLD ME DOWN!"
08,01hahaha
LOL
Why the ribs?
big tattoo
08,01what did she get tattooed?
I love this song, but it seems weird not having an orchestrated piece for a Star Trek intro. :P
she has many on her arms and upper chest too
a local performer that has inspired her a lot
/me 08,01is considering getting the BUCK logo tattooed on him bum
just colours and a silhouette
05im considerign getting a tatoo of the hollowed otu moon logo aswell as some kind of adaption of twi's cutie mark
05jsut played with the thought though

Well then you just contradicted yourself there
I'm probably going to get tatto of the triforce on my hand :3
Hello, what is on right now?
Hello Braviary, we're watching Star Trek :)
can I Link to a Song on Dropbox I'm working on to get some opinions?
With one, MegaMoonShine?
08,01i'm actually seriously considering getting a tattoo of Britannia somewhere
:3
I would like a tattoo but it goes against my moral code
^
*Which one?
05no matter how nice it would be
Not sure
The Next Generation, I think
05and i fail to see a moral dilemma behind tattoos
05MegaMoonShine: no its just enterprise
I would just totally be more badass than I am now, in some epic BAETUHL and just having the triforce on my hand :3
05not TNG
Not when you are me
she's becoming a Romulan!
08,01Wrek: aye; i'm still trying to work out whether i like the idea
I see :$
08,01and whether it will look good
as long as you don't get a tatto on your hand, face or forearm you're good
I want a Pinkie tattoo but I don't think the color would show up too well on my skin. The DH one will just be all black
awwww, she sad
08,01maybe pinkie pie's cutie mark...
or anywhere that'd be seen by a job interviewr
better than she mad
08,01hmm... i wonder if one can have one's penis tattooed...
oh, and I may have one last question about BronyCon for you :3
yes you can
:O
you can Staurn
you can have your dick inked
but it's not recommended
it's painful
but possible
Dragon penis is some guy who tattoed his dick to look like a dragon head, I think
Tattooing is painful full stop
:S
08,01just a thought... i can't think of any tattoo that'd look good there
excuse the language
I bet it burns when he pees.
EW
an elephant trunk
not because of the pain, but because of the skin stretching, it disfigures the tattoo
:[
and your inner thighs can be the ears
08,01and it'd mean i'd have to wave my genitals about in public for people to see
Wait a second, is that startrek....BTW, Hi everypony :)
yeah, it's--a pretty bad idea, EXPENSIVE and bad
:D
Hi Kawaii_icybeauti :)
you can open your basement up as a circus and invite all to see the elephant balance a beach ball
08,01and though i've not got any qualms about doing that myself, i doubt the police would agree
Hai Kawaii_icybeauti *huggles*
Heya MegaMoonShine
Hi AttacktheAndalite
Omg this is gold
facial tattoos are also a no no, since as you age, the tattoo's disfigure because of the skin changes
Oh yeah BUCK....You guys doing well with that?
what are the movies this friday?
Daygon: It's Balto, Te producers.
05Daygon: its tated on the front page ^_^
08,01Kawaii_icybeauti: aye, stuff's going well
I need to scan this page prob covering the personal info of mines but yeah i have a retirement account with one penny in it. wonder how much ill get in a few years... dar jpmorgan just get rid of the penny already........
i see
Kawaii_icybeauti: looking up flights to go there :$
HAI GUYS
Hiya Malmortius
Hai Malmortius :)
Serenity I believe so XD, and it's not as big as Bronycon Anyway, I think 400People or so
Hi Malmortius
MadSurge: I went to bronycon already, so I had my pony convention fix. I hope to go back next year.
pizza
hi Malmortius
how've you been doing Malmortius
good good. good.
LimeV, please stop lagging on me.
Lil_B: Would you consider going next year as well?
08,01"when's the last time you slept?" "over 2 days ago" "want to sleep with me?"
Serenity yes, maybe I even try toget to BUCK too
Considering I live so close to bronycon, I don't see why I wouldn't be able to go next year
so its 2 movies and 2 episodes?
Daygon: Eyup
08,01haha, dat foreshadowing of someone being burned
Coo
dat crack
OH SHI-
Oh noes! Leak :O
If BUCK is on next year, there's a 70-90% chance I'll be going. But I'll just be hanging around the quiet places. Not a big fan of parties after what my brother did at one :/
I hate parties
after concerts I always go home-
I knew i should have went to tokyo in tulsa
Kawaii_icybeauti: can't wait to meet people from here :$
I only attend parties if it's with my friends or family.
I don't even catch a drink with my friends- I'm terrified of drunk people
MadSurge: That would rule. I merely met the yutube celebrities at bronycon, but not the people who make this thing.
Drunk people are hilarious.
Vivix|Awai: Drunkards are the only things that I worry about, considering one almost kileld me
Killed*
aagh--yeah
Vivix|Awai I hate them too, For me it's always loud music I don't like while beeing surrounded by drunken douchbags
Like when my dad's friend was so drunk he bit the head off a bug.
O__________0
ew-
Ewww....
and all the DRAMA
That is crazy
Trust me, that was hilarious
Kawaii_icybeauti dat Protein :)
I know bugs have protein but.....
I'm glad my family is fulll of happy drunks
My brother gets agressive when drunk, and he gave me a basilical fracture, D:
Jmo4267: HECK YEAH! Like this one guy who sang the Film Flam brothers song whiel playing TF2 DRUNK! XD
!
*while
ikr Ponies47
I drink now and then, but never to get drunk
dat seth macfarlane
He did another one where he sang Winter Wrap Up :D
so- I've never been durnk, so i dunno if I get angry or anything
And the guy who puked in the middle of the motorhead soundlist at a concert
I think I saw that video :D
Jmo4267: Yeah! XD
MegaMoonShine: REALLY? :o
My mom said that for my 21st birthday, she's gonna take me out to get drunk.
Ponies47: Eeeeyup
!
....?
/me glomps Vivix|Awai !
I'm 23, never--even considered that for my 21st
Phlox has spoken
HI!
Well, 99.9% of the time, people begin drinking in high school.
HAI!
Afternoon, everypony!
MegaMoonShine: I found out the guys usernmae and friended him on Steam. :P
does somebody has additional money he could give me without return?
*username
Afternoon, Crono_brony :)
hi Crono_brony !
awesome salesman
Ello Crono_brony
Hey Crono_brony :3
LimeV why're you so damn laggy.
Cool Ponies47
Oh shit, leak is getting worse :O
Stepmom just bought me a MLP coloring book... Not sure if trolling, or actually respects me being a brony...
probably trying to be nice-
JUst Color on bro
me and sister bought a mlp book filled with stickers, and plastered them all over
Crono_brony: WHO CARES?!? Free coloring book! :D
he's dreaming of ponies
My mom LIKES me being a brony. My dad is meh
How I learned to stop worrying and look at the pretty colours.
Wrek: was wondering did mips fail?, only relly just noticed you're on limeV
my mother showed me a coloring book of "littly Fillys" (MLP Knockoff that looks like G3) and asked me if thats the stuff is I was taöking about -.-
>.>
Ponies47: yeah... but i hate how my dad knows that i'm a brony... He teases me for it.
filly! that knock off is creepy
Pony dreams are best dreams
why would you people tell otehrs about liking the show?
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2480/
that's asking to be mocked
good thing the book wasn't for me XD
Pony hard
Crono_brony: My mom likes me watching MLP. My dad is meh and doesn't really care if I do.
everyone I know knows- don't really get mocked by anyone
I'm gonna go run off to have dreams now since it is 3AM. Night everypony and enjoy yourselves. Vivix|Awai, REHEARSE DAMN YOU.
DREAM SEQUENCE
he se ded peps
Damnit! I'm doing it! Just..skipping notes to type
Ponies47: At least you have a supporting member in the family. :D
capt brony>
?
and GOODNIGHT
Brody.
Crono_brony: Yeah! My brother is also meh and doesn
LOL
Crono_brony: *Doesn't care
/me glomps Vivix|Awai and runs
Cpt Brony ftw
Vivix|Awai it sucks that Fillys are everywhere in germany -.- MLP is so rare to be found, couldn't get a single Blindbag :/
:'(
Ooh that sucks- I found a few at a Toys R Us in city
My mom would have me sent to a mental hospital if she knew
but not the Trixie or any of the cool waves-
Ponies47: My sister is a brony. (she prefers brony over the term pegasister.) and she's only 11! that's how we bonded.
mp merchndise is a wasteland here in gemrany
Crono_brony: O_e...word diferent please.
For the love of god
my sister is older than me, but we usually watch it together now and then
his voice sounds vermijar
my mom and dad "You like MLP? Isn't that for little girls? Whatever." they really didn't care :)
mlp is hard to find yeah- especially the new cool stuff
Lil_B: it's like almost impossible to get any pony merch in middle europe
Crono_brony: Lucky. My bro wouldn't give the show a chance.
issent it sisco?
They have similar cheeks....
Ponies47: that sucks!
I have repeated it several times but my whole family watches MLP now except one
I haven't told anyone in my family I'm a brony yet
my son and daughter are bronys and their parents are like isnt that show totally awesome !!
My mum was like "Right, you're 15, and you are watching a fucking 10 year old girl show?" My reaciton: "Shut yer fucking mouth. "
Eli I saw some at Galleria Kaufhof, but it was duriong a Brony Meetup, andthey bought ALL OF THEM!
Trying not to get dad to know
No one must know my secret.
[Alpha]: Who?
They'd probably be cool about it though
Lil_B: ouch...
MegaMoonShine: Keep it that way. unless the member is fully trustworthy.
I'm probably dead if pops finds I'mma brony
my dad don't care- but I don't think he minds
My parents look at me weird when I told them I watch MLP
I never told them though, it was just like "hey you guys sshould check this show out, it's great"
The second oldest. I'm the first and he doesn't care much for it.
Lil_B: i'm looking all over the local nerd shops, but all i found was G3... :P yeah, not gonna buy that
Eli well, it was fun seeing the faces of the people XD "Sorry, we are out of Stock... I even checket our Supplies... we didn't sold one in 2 month!"
/me hugs Eli
MegaMoonShine: same, they weren't fazed by me watching PPG (my dad quickly understood it wasn't a normal cartoon for girls :D )
05my parents probably thought me gay anyways
Eli: Whyyyy? But you can dress Rainbow Dash in Style!
/me hugs RainBowJack back
A bomb.
WARPFIRE
suddenly green
OSHIIIII
Oh shiiiiiiiiiiiit!! :O
"Aren't you too old to be--" "NOPE.avi"
Eli I'm planning on just get a High Res Picture and take it to a Print Shop to get it on a T-Shirt XD
Wrek my mom called me gay at first :D
I went to a the theme park with my DJ PON-3 shirt. i bumped into 1 other brony and alot of people we're staring at my shirt like O_o
Y U derp, chat!?
show the references, they will understand. (The big labowski, Star wars, etc.)
/me ate a random object
Fire in space?
And that's how that conversation ended.
But that's wrong.
AttacktheAndalite: Too old for good cartoons? *squawk* NEVER!!!
Lil_B: I'm thinking about shipping some merch over.
dinner
My dad is a big Star Trek fan. I should him Discord's parts :P
alexxm: Tea
I want hte NMM doll and Lyra--and Trixie. Ebay!
05aye
Nose
05you definetly should
Trixie is worst pony.
^
Chrysalis is best pony.
MadSurge: It's because I'm a female and 20. Lolol. My boyfriends parents suspect but they don't give him shit about it.
yeah, but she does worst the best
Eli I would do that too, but I always just say "Nah..."
Meanwhile: I was waiting for you to jump in :3
I would love to have plushies. But THEY COST TO MUCH MONEY! >_<
Lil_B: but, since it's not well accepted here i'm going for more suptle stuff. maybe a shirt with Lunas cutie mark, or a white hat with Vinyls. they are my favourites anyways :)
Ponies47: I knooooow, riiiiiiiiiiiiight!
Ponies47: Just get some brony to hire some illigal immagrants and the price will lower loads
AttacktheAndalite: Yeah!
Serenity: :D
Ponies47: I want a Pinkie plushie
AttacktheAndalite: I'm 6 years older than you and my parents humorously gave up on me being "normal" :D
enterprise just fart
:|
Less than 6 minutes. Ya know, no pressure or anything.
AttacktheAndalite: From what I heard. Walmart has a Pinkie and Twilight pillows :P
Eli yeah, I would oly take a shirt that only people who know MLP get it XD
my parents call me weird all th time, but thye usually say "and that's a good thing"
IMO, there's no such thing as a normal person
AttacktheAndalite: I can't wait to see what kind of merch BUCK will offer :D
suuure he is
Ponies47: FUUUUUUUUU-----I'd never be able to get away with that. I have a four year old niece. She's claimed all my McDonalds' ponies as hers.
well, statisticly there is, btu everyone is a freak in some way
There's always something fucked up with someone
AttacktheAndalite: Murder her then
Lil_B: exactly that was my thought. I think a grey hat with Octavia's cutie mark would be most awesome
my mother would buy me and my sister MLP toys at mac donalds
The MLP mer I have is 2 shirts and a brony wristband. I want more but i need a new computer! D:
AttacktheAndalite: Awwwwwww :<
Serenity: Noooooooo~ But she sounds like Pinkie Pie when she says "Hey!"
a COLD sonic shower would do
AttacktheAndalite: Murder her anyway >:3
She's given up on trying to take my calendar.
Hello everypony!
http://derpy.me/Kaw7P this shirt should be your answer
Hello BronyDarth :)
Eli but I also want one for my last day at school that really is just "BÄÄM, I Like MLP!"
dat morose pause
hi BronyDarth
Serenity: I'm fine with her having the toys cause I bought her some toys as well. As long as she doesn't find my Friendship Express DVD, I'm fine.
On the last day of freshman year I'm gonna wear my pony stuff. :P
haha
[Alpha]: at first i was like wat 6_9 , buthen iwas like oh :D
Ponies47: All the swag. If I weren't older I'd kiss you
It's gonna be SO AWESOME /)^3^(\
AttacktheAndalite : you can send it to me if you want :P
Ponies47: Do it! Everyone will love you!
You got a be a brony to get it :P
NASA were best Kerbals
AttacktheAndalite: Pony shirt and brony wristband. If I got more I can wear buy then I will wear them. :P
RainBowJack: Send what to you? The DVD? Sorry but hell no. I went to five different WalMarts looking for it
Hey umm a heads up. Hot Topic has MLP trading cards
Lil_B: that would be something :) I think I'm just going to order me a white hat with Vinyls mark right now. fit's my Ska style the best ;)
[Alpha]: Whut? They do? How much are they?
I bought a MLP dvd at toys R us, and it was dubbed and did not have original language option ;__;
3.50
RainBowJack: :3
MegaMoonShine: I should and I'm gonna. I should take a picture of myslef as well wearing my pony swag before I head to school that day :P
I now have a new purpose in life, and that's pony trading cards.
i just wish they would actually set up hot topics around here
AttacktheAvdalite : i cant get it here in the netherlands Hasbro Holland doesnt wan to releas it here makes me a sad pony
AttacktheAndalite: I got a friend who has been collecting those xP
I mean, mc donalds does it, why not Hot topic?
The closet Hot Topic to me is about 30 minutes away
http://i.imgur.com/AH4eJ.png Best r63 pony.
Eli: Hottopic does
Reptillians?
That pictures killed a small part of me
RainBowJack: Suuuucks *hugs* One day they will...one day.
/me quietly looks through his mlp cards from BronyCon
/me hugs AttacktheAvdalite
Ponies47: i'm talking about setting up a store in Switzerland/Germany
I might be going to Cantorlot Gardens. If I do. I'l lget to try out Fighting is Magic and maybe even meet Tara! :D
Is rushgamez here?
Hot topic doesn't exist here either- so if I'm gonna get any ponyswag, EBAY or Welovefine
I got a wristband, three shirts, a hat, a calendar, several toys from McDonalds, some blind bag ponies, and a DVD. I just need the belt and the cards and I will be sooo happy.
/me Nods at Eli
/me hugs AttacktheAndalite
hi hate that GalaCon isn't getting any big Celebratys :/
I really badly want to go to Canterlot Gardens Ponies47... it's on my birthday, but i just don't have the money
to go to any con I have to shell ou for a passport
AttacktheAndalite: I have a wristband and 2 shirts. I NEED MORE! But I need a new computer D:
and with agoraphobia and all that, there's no way I'm leaving the country
Sound in space?
Star Trek, pls.
http://derpy.me/JxhdO I'm sure Wrek would love this shirt
Eli: What state do you live in? I live in Wisconsin :P
RawketLawnchair movie Lagic, Space is the best Soundtransmitter
Ponies47: Computer first, so that you can order more ponies.
Lagic?
AttacktheAndalite:eeeyup
Dat Twilight
Ponies47: State? the lovely little country of Switzerland
AttacktheAndalite : i really want tha DVD
Ponies47: Ever heard of a plane?
Serenity: Duh :P
Ponies47: I know. I still want to go there :)
05nope [Alpha]
there's an australian season dvd
get zone free player and buy it
He so angry.
05if i am to buy a twilight shirt
05it has to be perfect
We don't get DVD's where I live :(
to bad i wanted a Compleet dvd box set of ponies
Wrek: Why not draw a design and take it to a shirt manufacturer?
Sounds like the same dilemma with me and a Derpy Plushie
MegaMoonShine : now i dont feel left out
Australia is working on that RainbowJack
05Serenity: for what money?
I still think there needs to be a MLP Soundtrack CD >.<
Wrek: You wanna buy a Twilight shirt? :O why would you wanna do that? that movie/book is awefull
Vivix|Awai: What, a posionous death pony?
full season dvd
:D
I want a box set too
looks liek australia's exports are gonna experience a peak soon
hug him tepal
Wrek: It costs like 20-30 quid in England, so that's around 23-40 euros
Eli: It's a maybe for me. I really wanna try out Fighting is Magic. Unlike SOMEPONIES here who downloaded the beta version. I didn't and willing to wait and try it out at Canterlot Gardens I hope I can meet Tara as well.
Also, pretty sure about 70% of Asdas do shirt printing
They do?
I don't tink Asda's exist very many places
Ponies47: yeah, i'm just gonna wait for the official release.
I've never even heard of it-
man this guy is a bigger crybaby than my sisters 8 years ago
05which is money i would spend on food, travel and bills
i dont really see how downloading the beta version of something that will be distributed freely is a crime
Eli: Yeah. If they are gonna be at Canterlot Gardens might as well give it a try :P
08,01funny story: if there hadn't been a miscommunication within the BUCK committee, we'd have flown out one of the Fighting is Magic devs and had an exclusive tournament of it at BUCK
05Buytoast: and you wouldnt cope liek that if your sister died?
Wrek: Never heard of a 30 euro food
well i mean, it's been like what, months to years sicne the giant laser?
05Serenity: i think in motnhs, sorry
http://mlkshk.com/r/HVBV <--- I saw this coming.
food is expensive-
Dark_Horst: it's destroying the surprise, and it makes it less special if mane6 would have released it
05Buytoast: only months, and he had it bottled up i guess
i mean yeah at first it's crushing but time goes on. you can't change it.
Eli: if you want suprise, dont download it. if other people want no surprise, then it'S their buisiness
He's recording, not writing.
Star Trek, pls.
the alpha testers just betrayed mane6's trust. "and losing a friends trust is the fastest way to lose a friend..." come on guys
Eli: exaclty. one alpha tester fucked up. no reason to attack the ones who downloaded it when it was up
I still want to be surprised
05seeentimeeentallityyy
FOREVER
05oh well
Eli: FOOOOOOOOOOEEEEEEEEEVVVVVVVEEEERRR!
*For
So I wait untill it is officially released
08,01moar star trek!
08,01Hat!
=_(\
IM BACK BRONIES!!
Wb c
calling it now the next episode is E2
Hey DoctoDoctorWho!
HELLO DOCTOR
Wb DoctoDoctorWho :)
yeah whatever. i just think it was a VERY bitchy thing to do. mane6 is doing a great job
:|
i for one completely lost track of it and didnt even know about the leak until a few weeks ago. i'll be surprised anyway
Moar star Wrek !
Ha ha, time for bronystate!
05pirate a tripple A game from say EA that is packed with greed and DRM? sure go ahead I wont hold it agaisnt you.
05pirate an Indie title? fuck off and die in a fire
Deeeeeeeaaaaaaaad.
^
^^
^^^
^^^^
^^^^^^
v
?
yeah Wrek get's the idea
I just finished making my OC, u guys wanna see it?
Wrek: it's not like they woudl earn anything with it, so the usual moral codex doesnt really grip
vv
Yeah
i hope he isn't beeing sarcastic
sure
Sure, DoctoDoctorWho
CALLED IT
http://imgur.com/dgqIl
Hey, everypony!
/me Is sorry :<
Hey, Shutterfly :)
05nice
05try a little lighter dark blue
nice
DoctoDoctorWho: looks somewhat like glaze
the reason we dotn pirate indie titles is becasue the studios behind them need the money. main6 dont earn any money with the finished protect. that line of reasoning doesnt work here
Hello!
*project
is there anything streaming?
Hey XylemTube
Hello XylemTube :)
glaze?
PONY
Shutterfly: enterprise
Anyone here looked into the startrek bridge simulator?
DoctoDoctorWho: woodentoaster
Dark_Horst: then why isn't it showing on mine? its just an add...
Shutterfly: get adblock
you'll love it
05so because they set otu with best intention to create something for the community
no ads anywhere
05its ok to pirate it?
no
I see, I find It really expresses me
i'm just saying the money thing is off the taböe
Stream is skipping around for me :(
beleive me, i'm mad at the prick who broke contract too
Soo how about that new mars landing?
Dark_Horst: but they need the support. and what is better to see happy and friendly faces of people when you give them the finished product? it's like you make someone a really neat present, and that person comes and steals it before you're done
05my argument still stands im my oppinion
sleeping filly woona ftw!
http://derpy.me/MukWB I like this shirt
I didn't follow all of this, but the reason not to pirate is not solely in money and legal mumbo
08,01Wrek: it's not pirating it if it's free. mane6 have actually said themselves that they think people should feel guilty for playing the leak.
Please refrain from throwing rocks into the stream
that's exactly my point
be mad at the guy who uplaoded it
08,01*shouldn't
not the ones who download it becasue they're curious
05free or not
Wrek: I couldn't have said it better
who is streming?
wrek is streaming Capfluttershy
still no reason to pick on the ones who do
look at the bottom left corner of the stream
05<@Wrek> free or not
Had sexual relations.
Congratulations Meanwhile
ohai hows your sex life
08,01Wrek: i'm not playin git because i don't want to ruin surprises for myself in the final version
Well mymission at the moment is to find the prefect Twilight shirt for Wrek
05jsut saiyan
/me highfives Wrek
is she vulcan?
Yes, DoctoDoctorWho
05DoctoDoctorWho: yes
08,01Wrek: mane6 don't lose out from people playing the alpha; the only people who lose out are the fans
Dat kick.
I'm Alpha :3
08,01there.
08,01now i won't be kicked
05im not arguing with you, im jsut saying it goes agasint my morals, henceforth i wont download it untill its done.
08,01aye, fair enough
It barely works anyways from what I hear. :P
http://derpy.me/P7vIj Alright this Twilight shirt may not be the perfect shirt but it is amazing
i thought the discussion was not about whether one would download it but the descrimination against those who have?
Wow, that's a cool shirt
05i dont like it
Dark_Horst: just don't start it again. let it rest.
meh... too emo
It's too sad I know
i'm not the one who brought it up
Done!
i am going to hit the hay goodnight everypony
wait...
there

Goodnight RainBowJack!

08,01Wrek: <3
Allo Everlasting_Joy
Wrek: I am so jealous right now!!! :O
Hi Meanwhile!
Wrek: the next trekathon should consist of anything that contaisn q. tat would be nice
okay finding the perfect Twilight Sparkle shirt is beccoming a bit of apain
05i own all the star trek movies
05but the only thign i miss is the original DVD box set
All we have is Kahn
05[Alpha] becasue it doesnt exist yet
great. now I have a whelming craving for a Butterfinger.
Wrek: and the animated series
05and that one
I'll look some more and then I'm done searching
Wrek, what is the perfect Twilight shirt?
there was an animated series?
Nine?
05one that isnt a meme, that is simplistic in design but emitts that dorky badassery
dammit phlox, you dog
08,01i have all the star trek films on dvd
08,01all 10 of them
05same here
05the box collection?
05blue box?
doggy?
WEll looks like I have my work cut out for me I'll see what I can find Wrek
TnG was always my favorite Star trek
Wrek: Yeah, I can now see how that would be difficult to find. The meme part makes it especially tricky.
08,01Wrek: aye
:O
05have that too :D
08,01Wrek: collectors' one, in which the insides are in 2 parts?
05Everlasting_Joy: well isnt a meme in a sense like the twilightlicious tshirt that was linked
05and yes
Wrek: Yeah, "Twilightlicious" would be a meme.
Forever alone
05poor reed
daww
left alone AGAIN
Pfft.
remnants of a discarded plotline, that reed was gay
:'(
Feeling awkward about being forever alone? We'll just leave you alone then.

"And redemption, an even great one (motivator)."
08,01shame they can't act.
Dohoho

08,01what's an eldar?
NEVAR TRUST AND ELV!!!

/me lets see should i chose a good B movie or a "troll" B movie... hmm
Oh lord, a "troll" movie. . .

Oh my goooooooooooooood.
Can anyone going to B.U.C.K who hasnt already done so please PM me

Just talked to stepmother. She wasn't trolling! She respects my brony-ness!
05nice

BTW Wrek, having Luna next to Twilight like you have her is giving me heart problems ;).
Awesome, Crono_brony :$

Exceeeeept that if you do succeed you'll have never gone to the past and then your descendants wouldn't be here to go through all this bollocks.

Darn you. All the original shirts seem to be of other characters
I blame the Time Ship Relativity.
Hello everypony
why aer all star trek aliens look ugly..
hello CCCP :)
Howdy CCCP!
my heart exploded again at wet fluttershy...
08,01derpyface: klingons are hot
hello daring_derpy and Everlasting_Joy
Hey CCCP!
yo CCCP
how you doing CCCP
hello Crono_brony and Eli
Hai alexxm
huh, she looks like voyager queen species
08,01Dark_Horst: thats not true!
Hello CCCP :)
05at buck
hi MegaMoonShine
08,01also, the borg queen is hot
voyagers borg queen*
These aliens kinda look like the Borg queen in terms of skull structure.
05you'll recognize me as the guy with a brotherhood of steel logo on the back :P
all aliens in star trek ar humanoids nuff said
08,01Wrek: i'll recognise you anyway :P
wrek thats awesome
BoS! Burner of cities! Killer of Civilians!
Wrek: just noticed ou've been streaming for almost 12 hours now... must be a record
dem ponies be multiplien,
oh this is the most bawss theme song
nuff said
05not yet
derpyface: there's a species in Voyager that looks like a lobster.
dex is hot. whatever she is
mmm sounds tasty
08,01Wrek: we're sharing a room; i think i'll be able to recognise you at the event
05i meant on arrival
05heh
Dn dn dn
Poor wrek is all alone.
lies
08,01aye
say, did we ever see a canonical representation of a caitian? besides the animated series?
whats a caitian again
i thi k i remember one walking around the voyager in elite force 3
*2
Spectrum_Rush: :D
08,01also, what's Brotherhood of Steel?
05fallout related
you dont know? blasphemy!
So. Who wants to listen to the majestic bag pipe?
alexxm: a feline like species
hehe
Brotherhood of Steel was an organization of agressive technology horders in F1-2 and 3 and NV
thanks Spectrum_Rush
and their logo is awsm
05if you ask me the "PonificatioN" of brotherhood of steel is completly uneccesary
Ah yes "Reapers"...
Apple Jack's Rangers
india?
05i mean really
though in NV and 3 they are less hostile I think- and in 2 they're not so..agressive
BACK
I don't they're ponified in any FoE fics
08,01Dark_Horst: i don't play computer games
you're mssing out
05fuck now i got the urge to play some NV
in my humbe opinion Fallout 1 and 2 are the best rpg's ever made. Ruined JRPG for me completely
playyyyyy
alexxm: just a little summary http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Caitian
Sex robot, sex robot.
Wrek: fallout equestria poniefied them anyway. not a bad job if you ask me
jesus it really is borg queen without a load of the tech
Well, not the name. Right?
05Dark_Horst
05i mean the name
I think FoE Heroes has a good sight of how--Brotherhood of steel was portrayed in fallout 1 by rumour
ohkay then
05brotherhood
05they use the same term
05in the pony universe
/me is away: DOOM
they call them steelrangers
arent that just STeelhooves group?
not the brotherhood of steel?
/me suddenly unsure
Vivix: nope. they toomk they called themselves applejack's trangers later
oh right-
but I swear No one dubbed them Brotherhood of steel
but steelranger is the common term used for one of the group
oh right, yes
05still
05brotehrhoof of steel makes no logical sense
yeah-
05otehr ponificatiosn of names thsu far has made sense
true. that is rather silly
Man..now I want to play fallout
it'S on steam sale right now
I have yet to try the unofficial patch for fallou 2, that puts in a lot of cut material and removes bugs-
I own all of the fallouts
except the playstation one-
crikey
it WAS
is there one that removes the time limit?
yesterday
!
Sale over?
pretty fuckin cheap, i might add
to remove the time limit in F1 you have to find the chip
then you can keep playing, because that is not the end of the game
the time limit in f2 is like 200 years?
Vivix: Im talking about F2, where you have I think 3 in-game years and then the game ends
yeah, they had a big fat banner.fallout 3 GOTY and new vegas ultimate. 7 bucks each
3 in game years? hm..
I can't remember being hit by the time limit- let me check on the wiki
=.=
lol, lizard guy'S contact lense wasnt straight
its 13 years
not 3
dem ponies be multiplying
I've actually reached that 13 years on some occasions because I was just wandering around try to get the special encounters
oh 13 years-
ah yeah- hm
Aquatics speak...sonar, for past tense.
I've already looked over 2000 t-shirts
after that I had no time left to wipe everyone out in every settlement :D
GTG LATER EVERYPONY :)
i wonder what the avians looked like
Later Ponies47 :)
Bye capslock.
Hehehe, that's determination Alchemist
well, I'm trying ot find a complete changelog for the restoration project
but- only found individual patch logs yet
Very funny Meanwhile :P
[Alpha]: and found anything intresting?
well I had the ammo and the guns, just not the time (I wanted to make sure I've done every quest)
Well there was a lot for the other characters but not much for twilight =.=
[Alpha]: really? her being the main character you'd think she'd get most attention...
http://derpy.me/Vgc8K this is the closest I could find and yes I am frankly irritated by that.
then again... Fluttershy's cutenes, Rainbow's coolnes and Pinkies crazynes steal the spotlight
punched
Fluttershy is a background pony.
And a very bad one.
http://www.nma-fallout.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=761726#761726 and http://www.nma-fallout.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=761727#761727 are the patches Alchemist
I can't find anythign about the time limit- but there's probably a way to break it
RawketLawnchair: don't troll on Flutters. you're gonna have a bad time
Eli: I speak the truth. And fuck you, I do what I want.
Yes a brick of a bad time :|
RawketLawnchair: lemme guess, you like applejack
08,01t'pol likes messing with them
RawketLawnchair: oh I see we're really friendly today... not that i care
Fluttershy is not an interesting pony.
Depends what you like
Still better than Rainbow Dash though.
oh, this is going to escalate
Nah-
Lagging for me
Dark_Horst: yep... exactly my thinking
Incoming flame war. Time for me to abandon ship.
It all just depends on what kinds of characters you enjoy watching
05Dark_Horst: dont count on it
:S
and that's--the end of that
have fun. i'll be back in 10
05no Eli
I love them all so this would be a weird conversation for me
hello ppl
I do enjoy them all, in different ways
ok if Wrek wan't me to stay...
Helloo
hmm star trek me thinks ?
Howdy HellsFortune.
hello HellsFortune :)
and Vivix is right
how've things been HellsFortune
uni is ew
They are all being played for fools.
Manipulation at its finest.
Woops, broke my scroll
and chat
Finest? She doesn't sound believable at all.
I'm going to look through the entire archive of t-shirts and then I'm done.
Broke ma chat, bebee
trust him, hes an engineer
or not
Oh shit! :O
death from above ?
Ooh, I remember this
Meanwhile hai!
No.
oh cheer up Meanwhile it might never happen
I've finished looking through the whole archive of shirts
08,01was he wearing red?
Noooooo he ded!
05yes
damnit
He really was?
never send redshirts on awake missions
05well
05he was the equivalent
Meanwhile no saying hi?
well, his name was red, as in never mentined before
are we discussing foe?
that's what redshirts are for
Gege
F O E
yeah
man i loved that
read it in like a couple weeks
me too
We were discussing fallout earlier, and some foe was mentioned
ever played metro 2033?
read it as it came out. the cliffhangers were agonizing
Took me quite a while to read
yyeah, up until the library thing, then I lost my save
ahh that sucks
Ah nice Dark_Horst
I read
I read it long after, loved it so much-
I kinda read it as it came out too
combines all the things I like, queer romance, light action, fallout, and ponies
andy: never played fallout?
oh yea
many times over
http://derpy.me/pxg3Q this one is nice
inb4 dead
working on new vegas now
I haven't restarted metro yet- but I have to finish it
Chrysalis hai!
loved the game. was all over the fanfic
hai CCCP
I loved NV, evne if the story wasn't--AS captivating as F3
much fangasmw as had
atm I'm reading Fallout Equestria Heroes
after that I'm gonna try new beginnings
yea nv in my opinion isnt quite as good as f3
maybe just because im getting tired of the game mechanics
I was gonna read Project Horizons but never really got around to it
yeah- it's got better gameplay and moral choices, btu the story just didn't capture me as much
05i enjoyed NV more than i enjoyed FO3
05it was a nice adition
And I'm done no more shirts for me =.=
I liked the GAMEplay and --atmosphere more, but the main story not as much
sitting on heroes now too. bit too depressing at times, but interesting none the less
bad lighting means someone will die
definately worth playing
05but both games lacked features from eachother
FNV was also made by a lot of the original creators of the fallout universe
agreed
including many things from the original F3
i like the concept of having a dumb fuckup as the maincharacter
hehe
F2 has the most fun dumbfuck mainchar option
Ooooh shit
if you have under 2 in int you can't speak properly
RawketLawnchair hai
lol
thats hilarious
I remember screaming "Grr!! Me hungry!" to people
thats pure genious
Hello CCCP! :)
never played a low int char in fallout
I looved that
Well shit.
hello MadSurge!!!!! 8huggies*
I think same happens in fallou 1
Later, gonna go get food
ded
I lsot most of my int in a mentats..overdose
daring_derpy: was talking about one of the pony fanfics B)
I'm skeptical about atking a nap at this moment because last time I went to sleep for 6 hours having several different dreams
Brb
taking
drugs were never as scary in F3 or NV as they were in the original games
What is it that we are watching?
Oh wow, that corner got crouded XD
so goomba decided to kill nice guy?
star trek enterprise
hmm
i love the doctor in enterprise
tapeworm. why not
Derpy is secretly half bat :D
awesome charachter
08,01hehehe
Rofl. Dat medical procedure.
oh god tapeworm is the worst
08,01the ol' tapeworm diet
we agreed to never talk about this, MadSurge
:D
just saying it
I wonder if F4 will have feautures from Fnv
if it ever comes
i doubt that
i think nv is supposed to be f4
I live in hope-
in a way
the fallout franchise played in a lot, right now bethesda is sitting on elder scrolls online
well NV was different company and all- but maybe
same mechanics as 3
oh god- I hope htey don't die the way Blizzard did
mmo games are freaky expensive to upkeep
one could argue that a 4 wouldnt be out of place
traditional
?
:S
I wasn't aware Blizzard died.
whatnow?
well, not really
if they ever make another fallout, i pray it will be in the style of 3
but after wow they've only made like 3 games
one failed paratrooper drop meansup to 70%
nv had awesome content itemwisew
Kinda- I hope they avoid horrible tings like that optimus prime
but the whole cowboy-thing just didnt fit
but- they better include ironsights and no set essentials and such from NV
I did think the cowboy angle was a bit silly-
lol i just came back after an afk break for 10 minutes and the first thing i see are talking fish people with arms
i agree cowboys dont fit in fallout
nuff said
but it is lasvegas and full of old--"for show" stuff
I loved how in.. F2 if you parked your car in new reno, sometimes someone would steal it and put it in a chop shop
you could get cars in f2 O.o
andy: yep
yeah
HAAAAAAAAAAAX
old nuclear power cars
oh man gotta love the nuclear powered cars
Could you put explosives in the car?
andy: neccessary. the map was spread over the whole coast. you had to cross badlands to get from location to location
not to blow it up I think, not sure
you could probably put a timed bomb in your boot
i just loved how the wrecks in 3 and NV blow up
yeahh
nuclear power EVERYWHERE
oh yea that is epic
I'd laugh, "Try to jack my car? Drive away with a 'gift'!"
This is surprisingly reminiscent of the ME3 Crucible.
this fights alot less epic
they even had fission in batteries
I love the lore behind it
if you mute it
as though its actually in space
the whole game world was more believable in f1 and 2. the decay in fnv looks not like 250 years. it looks not even like 50 years after the war
hehe
Nuka Cola......I wonder what it taste like
the thing with fallout universe is-
it's based on how it was viewed from the 50s
Whathe hell?
that's why there's no nuclear winter or anything
Meanwhile: not... really?
08,01DUN DUN DUUUN
*GASP*
08,01</rainbow dash>
what I didn't like in F3 was how ..3dog acted, and how he spoke of trees as if they were legends
andy: yep. they made quantum by adding an isotope. would make for glowing pee too
Dark_Horst: A big floating sphere with one group of ships defending it from attackers?
while forests were present in fallout 2
andy yup, and quantum was heralded because it glowed due to its radioactivity
Yeaah, I love all those crazy history things you read in Fallout
i think i just missed the entire episode because of this conversation
hehehe
as was radium when it was first discovered and its effects unknown
Meanwhile: not nearly enough to recemble ME3
how do i ping people
yes, palyed it
andy like this
just write their name
alpha
08,01time for some food!
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Nucleon must have been an awesome time, the early nuclear age...
did it work?
the ME3 scenario was completely different
no you have to write it exactly as it is
/me 08,01steals andy
for alpha just type [A and hit tab
lol
You have to have all the characetrs in order for it to work
i got stolen
Dark_Horst: Specifically the Crucible part.
08,01hahahaha
i know what you mean
<Vivix>
ho you dont need the <
but yes it worked!
Vivix
08,01but... i want to feed him icecream
yep, there you go
/me 08,01sighs
I step away from my computer and then suddenly I hear rainbow dash
08,01fine
but that'S like saying this is like that one time in star wars when the death star was defended by the empire
/me 08,01steals Unnr|Laptop instead
yes i am totally fine with being stolen if i get ice cream
he got disentergated
ill eat it anyway :D
08,01stabbity stab stab
Dark_Horst: I'd hardly say it was completely different, it's a large space based weapon being escorted to a destination and happens to be of similar visual appearance.
It's "Homemade"
/me is stolen
Nuuuuuue
Im gonna make a rogue to stab things
Hello every pony =D
:D
lol wonder what that means
Waaaait
Is this... enterprise?
Yay
yes
yea
Better
allo y'all
Hi dken!
Ohai Dken2021
oh shit they kidnapped jackie chan
maybe I should just pin the Headphoes I want on a Dart Plate and pick which one I'll by like that -.-
08,01those reptilians are quite hot
Their "hair" is offputting.
My friends keep telling me to buy headphones--
*faciakl
oooooh...the procedure ^^
**facial
DAMMIT
08,01i'm just open minded
some insectoids are crazy sexy
JUst do what you want
THis music just ruins the mood of the scene
but--I don't find THOSE attractive
lol
Vivix how much are you willing to pay?
especially about facial plates
i love the intro
Barbetos but it is the 2nd best opening ever
for headphones? I'm being pressured- so I dunno
yyeah... this Intro doesn't say "Star Trek" for me XD
08,01Vivix: chantho from doctor who was *very* sexy
I need new speakers before then- I blew out my monitors
/me googles
used to watch this with my cousins and we'd sing along with the intro as loud as we could
08,01[Alpha]: ah, a tim minchin fan?
Chrysalis I want to see kerbals streamed while this song plays XD
Lil_B: i think it hit the whole "past the boundaries"-explorer thing a lot better than the standart intro
I don't know who that is
dat giggle
Pinkie please go
they can be--attractive
What are we watching now?
08,01[Alpha]: google him
I cry when kerbals deserve to die :(
NO
Chrysalis: Gingers?
Wat iz dis
Dark_Horst maybe I just like the original orchestra more XD
what do they need hoshe for?
hot
lizard
i gotta buy enterprize nao
dick
"im sure"
andy: she's the shp's comm officer and linguist
They want her to decode a missing key to the weapon.
Good thing I shortened my name it used to be 17 characters long
thanks
andy: probably the best in current and future starfleet
I heard there is a kickstarter thing for building the enterprise replica
Vivix hey, found you a headphone guide if you're interested http://i.imgur.com/YckrO.jpg
Thanks!
I am going to need speakers before then- but yeah
I'm planning m-Audio speakers
http://derpy.me/aN7xP dww
dawww*
08,01m-audio are quite good
Mm--that sounds pretty cool
my friends all use m-audio
mmm, glob ice cream <3
08,01but i had a set of m-audio IE10s, and they were uncomfortable as sin
so--I figured maybe I should give them a go, I currently use cheap Empire speakers
that scares me a little
CCCP: Aww. . . I love ice cream.
Dken2021 wow, exactly what I need atm XD
oh you mean headphones? hm-
08,01aye
Well, if I buy M-Audio monitors I might aswell look at m-audio headphones too
Everlasting_Joy ponies + icecream = best thing
In Soviet Russia IceCream loves you
i like how they did the sphere map
08,01i'm rockin' a pair of Etymotic ER-4Ps
CCCP: Darn toot'n!
08,01they're *wonderful*
Thing is, I use speakers when I rehearse- so they have to hit around--80-90db I guess
/me googles
lol
The only thing I don't agree with that guide is that that Skullcandy lowest end buds aren't bad for the price point
RE4 vibes anyone?
sounds cool. Inject the parasites!
Well they are overated and fall apart easily
holy injection batman
that had to hurt
I was talking about Skullcandy
08,01Vivix: they cost me about £130, but they usually got for between £200 and £300
I used to use Koss padded earplugs when playing drums, but I can't set up the kithere
[Alpha]: everything but their bottom barrel stuff
08,01Lil_B: professional reference monitors
skullcandy pings me
they should have a painless procedure for the injection
makes it creepier
hm well- if they're good enough for reference monitoring I might consider them for mixing
once you get above 30$ pricepoint, their drivers start becoming shit for the pricepoint
but I've always been told to get monitors for that-
08,01for cheap and cheerful, i have a pair of Sennheiser MX470s
08,01they cost me £15, and they're good
oooh sennheiser is agood brand
08,01not fantastic, but great for the price
hmm-
I was looking aat-
Excuse my slow net
We are relocating the jam/rehearse thing to a basement, so we're looking to buy PA, but I really need monitors and--MAYBE headphones of that quality for my home studio thing
My back >.<
hello?
Hello!
mmyes?
I just scared the crap ouit of my mothyer and she attacked me :D
lol
I'm looking at Audio-Technica ATH-M50, Shure SRH840 and 2 Sennheiser HD Models but I just can't decide
/me hugs MahBoi777
/me hugs Lil_B back
MahBoi777, this "howdy" is what all true warriors strive FOUR!
so much wasted soace
space*
From Sennheiser I'm looking to buy e906 and a betamic-
are their speakers good?
Damn- the shop I frequent no longer carries m-audio
/me glomps Everlasting_Joy
Sennheiser is usually good quality :/ I once had In-Ear Headphones from them at 20€, they were good
but I was looking at the 500 dollar range
HEY Everlasting_Joy! how have you been?^^
ok, 500$ Range isn't my ligue XD
Hehe, well these are speakers and not headphones
so- it's not that bad concidering the competition
MahBoi777: It's been busy and ugly, I'll just leave it at that.
t'pol is going crazy
eww star trek?
what about KRK guys? Anyone tried?
05eew Dj_Cyber-4G?
no srry SLX*
they broke their vulcan
I hate it XD, all 4 Headphones have good Revies and have similar specs >.<

daring_derpy: that'S what happens when you snort toxic space rocks
Everlasting_Joy: well I hope everything gets better for you.
http://www.sound1.com/portal/asp/produktdetalj1.asp?Produkt_ID=4839 I was looking at these
KILL HIM KILL HIM

Eh- english site would be better
hai everypony, how you doing? :)
Vivix can I switch this into english?
hai Michael :)
hi Michael :)
hey Michael
let the bass cannon kick it!
hi Michael
nnot that one- but you can find it on thomann
MahBoi777: It will. It's the uncertanty that's killing me.
/me hugs MegaMoonShine daring_derpy andy CCCP
MahBoi777: How are you?
yay star trek enterprise
whats a good generation of start trek?
Everlasting_Joy: I am doing fine, thank you:)
What pony is that on the bottom left corner?
Wrek
..right?
05aye
You're so cute
:D
aww he's so cwute
05why thank you
you smoke?
These were the ones I looked at originally: http://www.thomann.de/gb/m_audio_bx8_d2.htm
have you considered buying used speakers?
The trend on smoking in Norway is terrible, a lot of 19 yearolds snuff instead, and spit it out eeverywheere- during musicschool we found it in windowsills- computer benches, floor- classrooms- ugh
Nno- not really, but I might look at the usedmarket if I decide on something specific
god no...
lol skyla?
wtf
That toy...
O_______________________________________-
you know what this means. g4.5
Is creepy
I should probably get a second set of speakers for loud sounds, Monitors are made for low sounds-
dat dari-bot post...
cadence and shining armor's kid maybe?
is scary as hell
nu please
After cadence didn't turn out to be a disaster, I trust them completely
how can a monitor be made for low sound?
05and so we welcome the offspring of cadenza and shining cant-keep-his-dick-in-control
did somebody say more executive meddling?
well, they're not made to play loud, but to play correctly at a comfortable level
Wrek wtf
whats with the star trek enterprise
Wrek: Oh god :D
omg Wrek
oh and let me explain, a monitor is what you call that kind of speaker
Wrek :D
i see
lol Wrek :$
you monitor the sound, so to speak
makes more sense now:)
Wrek xd
well Wrek when your wife a hotty its kinda hard... :S
XD Wrek
lucky the cartoon version doesn't look anything like the toy. otherwise i would have to ask the doctor to have a trip over to equestria and do and abortion...
I wonder, was he hitting Chrysalis too?
oh shit they made another abort-failed abomination?
Depends on his views on premarital boink
:S
Alchemist: what better way then to get love... :S
aw sheet more lights are flashing
O_O… *goes back to lurking*
things must be gettin bad
anyone know the brand of these earbuds here? I've had then a long time and they're like the best I had http://imgur.com/j5w47
damn he's ugly
classic star trek to have flashy lights everywhere
sooo anyone around with enough artistic talent to draw the child of Chrysalis and Armor?
Hi everypony :)
Isn't that the samsung logo?

Alchemist: yeah, that might hit it
cachi01|phone killerpony7733 ah thanks
look what i have in my hangar. it's an enterprise!
the Hu-mans
the humans!
amazed that the enterprise is still in one piece
shoot everything!
They should make a show named Enterprise, the early years. Just all abot building it
aim for the green buttons
Construction workers hanging out
its a tough little ship, the NX-01
im not sure how interesting that would be
It would probably onl run half a season-
Enterprise the early years. When enterprise was a little rebel ship
05i even have the cap with the NX-01 on it
hehehe
cap?
05exactly the same like the one used in the show during desert missions
nice
Allow me to scream nerd
no, that's prety cool
why does no one in the star trek universe has automated defense systems on his ship?
Nerds!
*nerd*
i once had a urge to get a enterprise pizza cutter. that urge passed quickly
I find it ironic that the fish people have the strongest military.
hehehe
lol
`ded
I'm gonna buy a ps/2 keyboard and throw this one out
butt
hey everypony
I was never aware of usb ghosting, but it bugs up my typing at times
Vivix: why?
ooooh pwetty
hey Sketch_Toku_Brony
oi shie
hai Sketch_Toku_Brony
Hi Sketch_Toku_Brony
my T's dissappear if I hit too much near WASD
Woom woom woom!
so not often becomes no, and so forth
NOT HE FISH!
lol
Oh snap.
Nerd at the shop told me PS/2 connection could fix it, because it can not ghost
ouch, thats an OP pressure wave
yea
woah wuts this movie?
Series.
And it's Star Trek Enterprise.
star trek enterprise
oh Star Trek
Sketch_Toku_Brony: enterprise. pre kirk series
ah i see
TLoZ the animated seried
pre kirk? oh a prequel
there's movie this night again?
THEIR PHASERS AREN`T SET TO HUG!!
i would feel so stupid acting in this movie and using the blasters
that was demoman grenade?
concussion 'nade? nice
Michael: yes, this series basically shows mankinds first steps into space how the federation came to be
*and
andy you would onyl feel stupid if you were dressed as a stormtrooper, can't shoot the side of a barn
^
^^
^^^
V
Transport problem again.
COMBO BREAKER FUCK YEAH
wat
I feel like someone is about to die
nope
all he had to do was wait behind a wall
Hehehe
Aren't the storm troopers alive?
yea
did he die
but they are clones
I never knew they were clones-
maybe
fancy disco ball
wait, i was right
Oh..right, yes
and usually they arent aliv e for long
yea they are like created at this facility thing
self-destruct time
http://derpy.me/TzXuf bah, I need to go grocery shopping
crikey!
dun dun dun
Did they do it?
mah
nah*
so many unexpected TWISTS!
the sphere got away
/me ate a random item
i love this series
Marmamaid?
What year was this made?
its pretty awesome if you get into it
I think they avoid people with stereotypically silly accents in serious movies..just imagine someone screaming in texan during this
Dashee: it'S the newest star trek series
Hmm...
a totally legitimate dialect, but often silly on movies
Star Trek?
I prefer lemomaid
oh ok thanks
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-N1ji-9xoZtM/UCGB8VIjHqI/AAAAAAAAE8o/hRB01t7KCvQ/s400/69170__.jpg you're going to love it!
nuuuuu
ded
plyyes
awesome timeing to choose a replacement
Polydunami: yes
DunDunDuuuuuun
WHO THE FUCK IS SKYRLA?
so this is the current star trek?
isnt it after the heart stops that you want to blast him with the paddles, and not before?
daring_derpy: dat is scary as hell
daring_derpy no
05the spawn of shinings seed
Dken2021: pretty much. but as mentiones, it's a prequell to TOS
^^
Oh god no
Skyla is Walter White's wife
05most likley
andy: not even when the heart stops
it feels early 2000 ish though
daring_derpy that's... pretty neat I guess... ??? WTF
OH GOD.NO
dat spoiler
weapon?
She looks cute on the drawing-
andy: defib is only useful if there is an arrythmia
but..old
arrythmia?
andy: aka abnormal beating rhytm
Dken2021: got cancelled after 4 seasons, i dont know the specific dates. but it's the youngest of the series'
shining y u fuck without a.condom?
i see
yes
05first aired 2001
malcolm voiced the templar in diablo 3
05cancelled after season 4 2005
cant zap a dead heart only if you plan to eat it afterwards
05too bad cause after season 2 it good good
lol
i heard hearts taste good
05andy its a muschle
05most flesh you east is
TV: cancel ALL the good series
/me pooped out a chicken
and its a tasty one :D
aww that sucks, it's always seems good things get canceled when they get juicy
Wrek: but it'S also full of sinew
05im sure it wouild be quite the meat
makes sense i guess
I think you can order heart many places
05Dark_Horst i wouldnt know
Up north here you can probably eat deer heart-
i guess it is
dear hearts are common eating
no expert either
yeah-
deer
I don't eat deer-
Deer hearts?
I`m getting hungry
yea
Hearts?
mmhnm
05dried deer if fan fucking tastic
I'm an involuntary vegiterian
Like hearts?
monkey brains
afk kitchen
Real hearts?
#the eat them out of the skulls
amazingly fantastic
with spoons
a couple of years ago I just -most meat makes me sick, but SOME meat is just AMAZING
http://derpy.me/Dm9tf cute, isnt it?
indonesia, i think
especially when fried in butter
heart is good meat
or vietnam
does it tastle like rabbit?
lolwut
dat insect
And if you eat the hearts will my life bar increase?
random conversation is random
hehehe
and I shall call it mini-me
cachi01|phone: vietnamese will tell youn that
in the north here you can buy BLOOD PANCAKE
all dem desktop ponies
pancakes made of reindeer blood
I know how to cook cobra
sounds disgusting to me-
Blood pancake
05you mean blodpudding or?
noo just blood fried in a pan
Black pudding. Nom.
the samic has it-
05cause it is awesome with ligonberries
http://test.metzgerei-duerrbeck.de/images/blutwurst.jpg blutwurst
Vivix: blood sausage also sounds disgusting with all that cubed fat and tongue. but it's actually fucking tasty
Ammunition? Blood pancakes? HEARTS? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
baked cobra...mmmm
I can't eat most of that stuff-
wow are these episodes getting shorter?
Hehe
andy nope
your just getting into it
Lingonbær? is that... tyttebær?
what the hell is THAT in english-
05you tell me
05http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_3Era9Ol2vkA/SqVDNKPyMII/AAAAAAAAALQ/CKIDW4BoJ9U/s320/lingon2.jpg
red small berries?
lingonberry
:O
tyttebear is like the most stupid danish/swedish word ever
the hell?
Wrek: Dem bananas
it's norwegian ;__;
...
and than there's greenland with it's rotten fish
i knew that
yees, those are amazing Wrek
now that i cant understand either
preiselbeere in german
05we jsut call em lingon
/me is eating fried fish
so much action
I usually buy lingonsaft at Ikea <,<
Klingon.
Striker yum
Klingon lol
man kh 3d is so fun :$
ikea is pretty good for food
Meanwhile: where?
Yeah, they got some good stuff
nobody expects that
hehe yeahh
Meanwhile: there are no klingons herw
we need klingons on the enterprise
Klingons never surrender
only lizard men
Dark_Horst: I was making a joke on lingon.
nom nom nom
ewwww
No not the mousies! :'(
Yum!
poor mice ;__;
those poor mice
well that's disturbing
so damn cute
tasty
Meanwhile: okay then
ominous music while eating mice
Klingons eat lizard men for breakfast
juicy!
and mood breaking music
http://derpy.me/X61Z-
The muisc almost always crash with the intro
And lizard men apparently eat mice for breakfast.
that's racist!
http://derpy.me/AH812
it seems somwehat logical
Mice eat klingon for breakfas
CCCP: Optimus is like "I'm o.k. with this."
in soviet russia
Everlasting_Joy haha
/me is back (gone 01:18:12)
derpy is best pony
andy go on...
hai Underpony
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW, i just got flippin killed in skyrim... by an arrow in the knee from a flippin falmer elf
no!
Wb Underpony :)
derpy + TTGL : win
Haha
Spectrum, the irony
hai Underpony
Spectrum used to be an adventurer like you
hello Underpony
Spectrum_Rush so you got hitched?
But then he took an arrow to the knee
Yay
hey guys :3
I went through fallout with Moiras modified vault suit, I can't do the same in Skyrim- I neeed better armor
ello ThunderStrike
But it HAS to be light armor
Hi under!
people should learn to thicken their knee armour if they want to keep their adventuring career
er.... under
05i enver cared for the vault suit in fallout
Dken2021: hm?
Vivix: light armor worked for me
most of my armor has no pants
ThunderStrike sorry, wrong ping
Vivix: smith your own
ah yeah, NV is better for RP
my smithing is like 0..
or 13
Can we agree to not stream any Star Trek tomorrow? ;__;
Dken2021: oh, okay
I has daedric armor.buck yeah
i always went for max positive karma in f3
in NV I used..the stealth armor from big empty
05MadSurge: umad?
Vivix: you should change that. it will be worht your while
Vivix: god i no the feel doing a mage right now and i dont have armer just yet /)_-
U MadSurge?
hehe yeah-
/me is now eating a hotdog
Ewww a dog
I'm an archer using leather armor, but I need something stronger and yet light
Spectrum_Rush so this what happened to you? http://derpy.me/NGuwT
Wrek: small guns at 100 FTW /)
Vivix: elven
Vivix: then glass
yyees- but I haven't found either
the highest in light is dragonscales
I've found EBONY armor, but I can't use that
Vivix: you dont find. you forge B)
oh really? Hmm..
Dken2021: no literally arrow -> my knee = me ded
i love dragonscale light armour
Wrek: no, I'm happy for all trekkies in the chat. I'd just like to pay more attention to it :D
I have no forge skiills ;__;
Vivix get daedric
Ohh
Vivix: they're easy to aqquire
isn't that super heavy?
05waht MadSurge?
Vivix: if you are using light armour then dragon or glass is best choice
Vivix yeah but its best armor
Okay- yeah I should try to--train up for dragon
glass can be better than dragon>
?
Vivix: make lots of leaether bracers then sell by more leather repeat
but I can't heav hevy armor, I'm a hoarder
Vivix: just spam leather armor at the forge. also look for mines. iron is good to to simply increase your skill
ah yeah- okay
Vivix: the left branc in smithing is light amror only
Vivix then light dragonbone armor
ah okay, cool
andy: I think the armor rating difference is marginal but the glass is much lighter
Wrek: Star Trek makes me want to play games and I don't pay much attention to the chat :D
k makes sense
Boo!
05heh
05not many eps left anyways
In F I liked using super light and low level armor, because I could move fast and carry more
I didn't die that often-
if your high level you wont need high armor anyway
Wrek: theres still season 4
andy: you're*
the only thing that bugs me in Skyrim atm is dragons
Bitch please
i hope this arc finishes sooon, gotta get up early tomorrow
most of them refuse to land- just--they're eeverywhere
how can that bug you
dragons are awsome
Just use some arrows
why are you guys talking about Skyrim?
well, they're sexy and cool, but they're Eeeverywhere cause I ignored them for so long
and heavy armor is better because you can get a blessing from the steed stone which negates all movement difficulties of the heavy armor
God Damn it dwemer ruins why u so big :[
but then I can carry less
Spectrum_Rush: bc Dwemer
Striker because why not?
I've always played light characcters in my games, cause I pick up Eeeverything
no, the steed stone negates that
dwemer ruins are awesome. full of dwarven emtal. good for smiting skil
Anyone max lvl here?
why hello otakon , whened you get here
it negates that too?
i always go light as well more fun
Hm..
yep
if you choose the havy branch, that is
/me is max lvl
ah-
Dashee me
lAG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Spectrum_Rush: a while ago
otakon , you seem to pop in and out sometimes, hello
I've lplayed on and off since release, I'm still level 25
Ha
hiya Dken2021
okay brb my food is a calling
he sees himself
Vivix: http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/The_Steed_Stone_%28Skyrim%29
time paradox
Wrek: hope I don't sound like an asshole though...
05well thats how you came out
MahBoi777!
has anyone read cupcakes yet
cachi01|phone awesome, i'm a lvl 55 khajiit
Everypony has
05"please no star trek tomorrow"
Ooh, I might have to try th steed stone
05maybe rewording would be in order
i stay away from cupcakes
Vivix: if there is one skill in skyrim you should alway take, it's smithing. left branch is light, right branch heavy armor. choose one. you can find mats to skill them all over the place and there are vids on how to find mines with the required ores everywhere
Dashee lvl 81 nord :3
Smithing and Enchanting
Okay, I'll do that- I needed something more to do anyway, stopped main questline
good ones to use
otakon hai!
i have yet to see an armor that comes even close in protection value to what you can smithe yourself
cool, so 81 is max lvl?
hiya CCCP
Eeyup
Dashee: eeyup
80 level ups
yep, smithing and enchanting is a must
lol doctor is soo calm about his final messages
I also suggest Sneak
05i was sad to hear the DLC would be console only
hai otakon
05i hope that has changed now though
But only like 50 skill points
Dawnguard?
05would loooove crossbows
Dawnguard is out on PC now
ugh, all this talk of skyrim just makes me want to play it, but my laptop sucks with PC games
05nice
it came out--last week
05ill pic kthat up once i get some cash
I would buy it, but with my current net--
on my first paythrough, i did a lightly armored sneak archer. sneak attack EVERYTHING
0.6mbps boys- it's horrible
I picked up sneak and archery too, but that became OP very quickly :D
that was fun, indeed
sneak attacks are best attacks
05you have my condolences Vivix
it is very OP, but hella fun
Magicka FTW
"We're not dead yet, and we're not ready to die."
hehehe, we hope to get better net with wireless netcom-
Vivix: :(
We used to have 16mbps, but then we moved
am i the only one here with master.destruction spells?
now Im a one hander (sword) with some destruction and blocking skills on the side.
/me has master spells
current playthrough is a greatsword brawler. heavy armor of course
Be back later, testing
I have 99 Archery, i only use my bow
I am light armor, small axe and stealth+bow
it's fun to jsut hack everything to pieces, but it can get dull sometimes
Be back later, testing
quite challenging to take out dragons with a sword
Be back later, testing
erm... thats a lot of desktop ponies...
Be back later, testing
Michael which is ur fave? Mine is the one that looks like a kamehameha lol
Be back later, testing
Flyboy not as much as 109
wrek's oc has a hell of a job to do on that painting
Be back later, testing
I think Underpony is testing... :S
Be back later, testing
cachi01|phone: the fire spell is quite good in dungeons
Be back later, testing
Yol Tol?
the most fun i had was when i discovered that you can slit throats when you sneakattack someone with a one-handed sword from behind
Or when surrounded also
ohh, I have to try that
until you get 100 at enchanting and put 2 destructive enchantments to your weapon with max damage, then proceed to upgrade it to legendary and you are OP again :D
man lol all this talk of skyrim makes me want it >.< though i have to get my ps3 repaired first sigh 100$ down the drain for that :$
Aww
I prefer it on computer, since it's a bethesda game
Goat noise in the background.
I almost NEVER get sneak kill animations
when a bug hits me, dev console power!
05elder scrolls games are always better on PC
even when I buff the damage
Vivix: not sure if it requires any sneak-perks.... probabaly does. but i know it works with swords and daggers
and so much lag!
any1 here is gonna buy GW2?
05almost purely casue of modding
skyrim is awesome for a while but it gets really repetitive
GODDAMN YOU LAG!
ah yeah
and yeah, the mods make it worth it
GW2?
I need horse mods, the ai and animations are--not to my liking
I only have a crappy laptop, I want a good gaming pc but can't afford it :(
that and the third person
Wrek, those Fluttershy dragons are proof of that.
Wrek: It a essence skyrim has a unlimited amount of hours almost due to the sheer amount of mods
I payed..
Andy only when you finish all quests. And that takes its time
in*
Striker: guild wars 2
oh
zoom and enhance
800 dollars for my PC, i7 3.2ghz and 16mb ram
old gcard, but it works
so why don't they like the human?
gb?
16mb ranm
andy: I thought the same, then I gave up being obsessive-compulsive while clearing out caves and the problem got solved
thats tiny
08,01inb4 ded
PC Y U SO EXPENSIVE :(
well- In norway that's cheap
Vivix: sandy or ivy?
he's infected
what now?
Alchemist: lol that might be my problem
FUCK ME, I got scared by a fly's shadow that was gigantified by the lamp D:
cachi01|phone: but funny to mount
Vivix: the i7. sandy or ivy bridge?
lol
I`m going to get a gaming laptop after I move out of my apartment
What are we watching btw.
/me fucks madsurge
Oh, I don't know man- how do I check easily?
You asked for it
I bought it last summer, so my memory is horrible
Vivix: should say in the processor description
I was watching the Olympics the other day when a wasp landed on the camera lense, it scared me to death
a desktop might be a good choice of you want better performance
of*

Dashee: Holy crap!

It looked huge lol

08,01i like hornets
08,01they're like huge, docile wasps
it was full of explosives
nope nope
I get good perfomance on a 4 year old PC because I still own a 19" CRT monitor with a max res of 1280*1024 :D
what's wrong with them?
nope
Vivix: oh well. those names are totally non-describing nowadays anyway
lol http://derpy.me/uAz5e
no bee/wasp discussion
nope
:D
2600K is clocked, 2600 is underclocked? Ic an't remember
otakon: compared to wasps?
CCCP: Bob Ross is a boss.
i miss the days when you could say "the numbers in this processors name are higher, it's the better model"
CCCP: happy flutertrees
REMEMBER THE BIRDS AND THE BEES?
I never overclock and pay extra to have it not factory clocked
Everlasting_Joy ikr!
Unnr|Laptop: yes compared to wasps
I MADE YOU
Hornets can kiss my as
WELCOME
but today intel seems to be obsessed with utterly confusing their customers
ded
Michael haaha
*squee*
Sorry for that spam earlier, Xchat crashed. Not my fault.
lol somepony squeed
I love that noise :)
08,01twilight_sprinkle: who?
i7 2600 3.4 was the top of the line back when I bought it, it'll last me a good..while
fluttersquee is bad timing
otakon: hornets kiss can hurt
perfect way to end that scene
I buy new computer every 5 years or so
08,01otakon: have you ever handled one?
usually never pay a lot since I buy part by part
arent parts just as expensive as factory?
I`m going to get an Alienware
Vivix: 800 bucks you say? did you order it in parts?
andy: Amazon my friend.
well kinda, but they're not charging for putting them together
yeah, parts
dat is expensive Striker
Shran
yay blue dude is back
and if I like.. NOW I need a new gcard, I can pay 200 dolalrs and be back on top
Sonic boom!
then wait 2-3 years before I upgrade again
Shran is a Bro
I misread that to blue dude is black
Vivix: where did you order?
Thats why I`m going to get one a year after I move
Datakjeden
:D
norwegian store
thx
hey it's papa smurf
Vivix: also you get the warranties individually for every part, while if they put it together for you and you open the case the warranty is void for everything
Destroy!
08,01otakon: hornets or wasps?
yeah, you get all the individual warranties
which is very nice
That wasp was creepy as hell
STAR WARS ALL OF THE SUDDEN
yellowjackets sucks
08,01otakon: well you must be really annoying to them, then
Is there a bee fetish?
yesss
oh
that's interesting
Alchemist: so if you buy factory opening the case will kill the warranty?
So, for anyone buying computer to--play games I suggest buying parts, and only what you need. It will last you much longer than a laptop, and save you money if you get help putting it together
Vwomp!
08,01otakon: i've handled hornets, and have not been stung
andy: in my country it will, not sure about the rest of europe though
hmmm... i might have a slight language problem ther
08,01wouldn't even consider doing it with a wasp, thoguh
08,01i've been stung by bees >.>
Dark_Horst: yeah, Datakjeden is norwegian, ships scandinavia, I'm sure there's stores more suited to you in your country
so are the smurfs assholes or what's the deal with them?
probably
reverse the polarity!
i like bees
05i was bitten by a bumble bee once
08,01flox would be an awesome captain
i know of alternate, but they arent the cheapest
turns rod around: changes colour to red
05it was tuck between my foot and my shoe somehow
Wrek: O_o?
05poor thing
Vivix a triple b pc like that is worth 600$ :(
Wrek: it bit you?
Ouch... :(
goddamn bees are scary
05stuck*
08,01Buytoast: they're so not!
i once stomped their hive into pulp when i was a little kid
the thing with big pcs..eh whatevernameisinenglish, they last a really long time
bumblebees sting, they dont bite
about 40ish of them stung me
uh oh
that must have been painfull
05Dark_Horst
little bastards
spoiler: humans win
05wahtever
and if you find yourself lagging on gcards, intead of new computer you just buy one part
DAMN NATURE YOU SCARY!!
bye bye dylithium
it was jidden in a rotting stump
08,01Buytoast: well, that's your own damn fault then, isn't it?
hidden
08,01heh
Wait wait wait! We're talking about bees and we haven't thrown Nic Cage in here?! I'm impressed :).
those little bastards shouln't build their homes in stumps
they're bees, not monkeys
Does NO ONE have any type of armor in this show?
08,01the first time i tended a beehive, i was really surprised by the warmth they generate
ded
Armour is for pansies.
red shirt
08,01i don't use gloves when working hives
dont need armor when you have lasers that can cut thtough metal
Meanwhile: no armor is for people who don't want to die
either way your deaad
And i misread that to armor is for penises
otakon: Pansies.
that wierd dude is wearing shoulder pads
otakon: the reptiles suits reflected energy weapons, but they found a way to counter that
Dark_Horst: ah
inb4 it's not the last of them
well he is a wierd dude
say has anyone seen Game Grumps?
welp they're dead
they have crackly faces
andy: their skin is breaking down
Sketch_Toku_Brony: yeah, i didnt like it though
game grumps?
They did it?
SLENDER MEN!!!
08,01Spectrum_Rush: using your bare hands makes you gentler with the hive
what about the Game Chumps? other than that they are garbage
andy: it's from being in that dimension
08,01so they don't generally sting you anyway
i see
YEEEEES! :O
most hive workes I've heard say that bees are nice- so yeah
lol, that was a planet?
boom
05no
Nnananananananananananananana SLENDY!

aaah

Do people farm wasps?
I'm not sure wht wasps do-
05wasps dont produce anythign we use
they really only scavenge
they eat meat
05not like bees

A chicken EATING CHICKEN?
what do you get from farming wasps?
Ah alright

05they act like food for some birds if anythign i guess
i hate wasps
yeah-
Like how you can buy a bag of mice for your snake..
wasps are assholes
^
they arent really beneficial to anyone other than birds though
wasps look badass
Bees to wasps
I like birds , though..
they bit me one time when i was driving :(
Bee's are good
Wasps/Hornets are lousy
i remember seeing a parody to the intro w/ the VAs of derpy and vinyl called Game Derps pretty funny
birds are pretty cool
Sketch_Toku_Brony: yes it was
Birds can be messy.

MissShizu: Dang, would be cool otherwise :P
Captain_Maid_Discord: We should call er' "B.R.SMAIDS"
Mr. Gibbs
13you'll notice you never actually see the eye enter or exit his head, the camera is never quite looking at it
11,01I like Dust Bunny better.
/me gives Captain_Maid_Discord his signature Feather duster cutlass
ADMIRAL!!

0,14Yeah?
05but atleast in the second movie we get to see an empty socket
13jaja
11,01Thank ye Firstmaidsith!

And that line was somewhat butchered.
Messing with the logic of an enchanted item like a boss
WHERE`S MY RUM?!?!?!

13now... aren't those two the redcoat guards from the first movie?
08,01dat edinburgh accent
they have boners
Captain_Maid_Discord: Thats the perfect maid. I think, however, that all crew should have "maid" in thier name somehow, and other crews of other ships should have a defining letter/word/mark
Wasn't that Dress the one Ragetti wore?
13and the ones guarding the chest next movie?
=_(\

13later on we have pintel and ragetti (think that's the two bumbling pirates names) arguing over how to pronounce 'kraken'
THE CRAIG MCKRAKEN!
Sick fluttershy on the Kraken. Problem SOLVED
MissShizu: Krahken?
MOVIE OVER
Kray-ken. Say it right, ye bloody wanker
13it's a reference to the debates they actually had during writing on how they would pronounce it

Well, night everypony

G'night everypony! :)
>be n00b
night Serenity
Night, Serenity
I THINK YOU SHOULD PICK A WORD/LETTER/MARK to mark your crew with. so we can tell which crew your for. Like me, its obvious i am a member of Captain_Maid_Discord's group
With two kk = fast pronounciation of A
Gnight Serenity
05you are all wrong
>demand ponies
Night Serenity and GilDash
05you pronounce the a wrong
EVERYONE knows the rules of grammar
RELEASE THE KRAKEN
Let's get Kraken
/me salutes Commodore_Wrek
Yeah I agree Wrek
Bye Serenity and GilDash :)
05kraken
13most everyone knows it as "crack-en", and ragetti is arguing for "kray-ken" as that's the origin of the word
its KRAHKEN
olol, Wrek's a commodore 64, I'm so FUNNY. *goes*
We need a Kraken in MLP:FIM
00,10yeah it's pronounced bob
13and the script writers really were going back and forth on how to run it
Sumica: Ofc
WHO TOOK ME RUM
Indeed. Kraken in MLP.
Mind the boat
Sumica: release the bob?
13Sumica: mind the boat
Mind the boat
Clearly it's pronounced Crew-ken
Kraken is MLG
0,14can we compromise and call it giant squid?
Mind the boat.
LOL
/me releases the kraken
cant wait to watch indiana jones Kraken his whip
ZECORA!
AdmiralSaxy: Aye!
AdmiralSaxy: Mind the boat
AdmiralSaxy: No because there's a bunch of giant squids. Kraken are special
is mind the boat a special phrase or somthing?
AdmiralSaxy: No, because it's not really a squid.

0,14Meanwhile, mind the boat.
Commodore_Wrek: we can do it. we have the technology
13there's one shot that focuses on the locket and i think a boot or something, it's so fast but it's a huge foreshadow for the next movie
/me minds the boat.
