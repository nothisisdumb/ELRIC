<herospirit> Is that bad?
<DecapKing> whatever im apathetic about life
<VioletVanilla> 6http://images.memegenerator.net/instances/500x/9761363.jpg
<MeteorVenture> depends.. is it when reading a fanfic about destroying the world?
<herospirit> No. It's when I go for walks.
<MeteorVenture> lol well it's definitely odd
<Pegacorn> I like hugs,it just because.....Fluttershy tried to murder me earlier today.
<MeteorVenture> i don't whisper things i'm not thinking about to myself
<VioletVanilla> 6@bouncymeter Pegacorn
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Pegacorn is 32% bouncy. (1694)
<herospirit> So just me there?
<DecapKing> i think to myself of how much i hate the human race
<MeteorVenture> could be.. i mean maybe your brain is wired some unusual way haha there's lots of possibilities
<herospirit> It's like whistling without thinking about it. Except I plot to destroy the world.
<WhatPayne> Aw, we are not that bad.
<VioletVanilla> 6WhatPayne said
<VioletVanilla> 6OHO
<VioletVanilla> 6:3
<MeteorVenture> do you usually think about that stuff or read about it or something?
<MeteorVenture> or did you used to?
<DecapKing> im just disappointed by human nature at this period of time
<herospirit> Actually, I don't really even plot. I just suddenly say something like, "well, I could always destroy the world", In a tone as if I was talking about what to have for lunch. :0
<RobotPinkie> what up ponies?
<VioletVanilla> 6OMGSH
<DecapKing> Violet i think i could use a hug
<herospirit> Nothing much Robot, just talking about my mental issues
*VioletVanilla 6ponypounces RobotPinkie
<MeteorVenture> lol well maybe that's pretty much all it is.. a habitual saying
*RobotPinkie hugs VioletVanilla
<VioletVanilla> 6Hallo RobotPinkie!!! ^.^
<WhatPayne> Ohey RobotPinkie
<herospirit> That's how it seems Meteor. I chose one weird habitual saying though :P
<Wrek> 05Asscassaroles, Asscassaroles for everyone!
<RobotPinkie> ohay, and gratz I guess VioletVanilla
<DecapKing> well another thing i suck at is being noticed
<herospirit> Asscassaroles?
<RobotPinkie> hey WhatPayne
<WhatPayne> How's the Splincer Cell? RP
*Pegacorn tries to get away from VioletVanilla
*VioletVanilla 6turns around and hugs DecapKing
<RobotPinkie> Haven't really gotten any further, WhatPayne
<VioletVanilla> 6Hugs for you~ :33
*DecapKing hugs back
<DecapKing> thanks
<WhatPayne> aw. Well tell me when you do.
<Pinkie_Pie> Noooooooo!
<VioletVanilla> 6Not an issue Decap~ (:
<RobotPinkie> You were working on something too, WhatPayne?
*Pegacorn is still in his bunker
<Pinkie_Pie> The Terraria MLP mod replaces the Dryad with Fluttershy..
<VioletVanilla> 6And thank you RobotPinkie! ^^
<Pinkie_Pie> And now..
<MeteorVenture> lol well ya.. but idk if i would say you chose it.. i don't think we always choose what we do necessarily.. but what happens next is what we get to decide
<Pinkie_Pie> I built a house for her, and she spawned in a hole outside of my fort
<Pinkie_Pie> Unsafe
<Pinkie_Pie> Now I have to guard her for the entire night
<Pinkie_Pie> WHY
<Pinkie_Pie> Funnily enough, she spawned in a hole with a bunny
<WhatPayne> I am working on bunch of MLP fan stuff, but not any game covers atm. I was thinking of ponifying some, but that's when I'll finish current stuff.
<MeteorVenture> that's just a brief thought though.. i haven't given it enough thought so don't take that as my opinion necessarily
<Pinkie_Pie> > mfw bloodmoon
<RobotPinkie> lolol I'm trying to get a grip on Cinelerra, it's pretty hard to work with.
<WhatPayne> Cinelerra, that video editor, whatcha you editing?
<RobotPinkie> not to mention it's slow as fuck on my computer :(
<RobotPinkie> Trying to make a funny pony vid, kinda.
<WhatPayne> Alright, makes sense.
<RobotPinkie> Oh, new IRC network?
<Dermathil> HAHAH
<prince-dari> Hey.
<RobotPinkie> guess I'll see you guys over there, then?
<WhatPayne> What new IRC? on the same server?
<Dermathil> FIRST NON-MOD
<Dermathil> xD
<FreezeFrame> What's the new server?
<DecapKing> Dari, Princess Luna is the best pony
<FreezeFrame> Put it in the title for those of us not on mibbit
<FreezeFrame> er, topic
<prince-dari> MFW Wrek's server isn't up. >_>
<prince-dari> Wrek
<prince-dari> God dammit Wrek.
<prince-dari> >__________>
*Pegacorn runs out of his bunker
<Nittany_Tiger> Changing IRC network again?
<WhatPayne> One does not simply F5 ChatZilla
<prince-dari> >Server is supposed to be up 24/7
<prince-dari> >Wrek's server isn't up
<prince-dari> ADGIOAJDFOIGASJI£$()ASJKDGPOAWITAosdfyia0wetjkal3tjnseoaryazy
<Dermathil> SO, something DID go wrong?
<Dermathil> I am actually surprised!
<DecapKing> well im feeling better
<prince-dari> I'll tell you when Wrek puts his server up. >_>
<prince-dari> Nothing went wrong.
<RobotPinkie> Oh... so we're staying here?
<prince-dari> Everything went as it should.
<Dermathil> but what about wrek's server?
<prince-dari> But Wrek hasn't got his server up, unrelated.
<Dermathil> AH
<Dermathil> excellent then
<FreezeFrame> There we go.
<Dermathil> molto bene
<prince-dari> Nope.
<FreezeFrame> server is irc.bronyserv.co.cc for users of real clients.
<prince-dari> >round robin
<MeteorVenture> either way hero i wouldn't worry about it but if it's freaking you out just break the habit.. but in order to do that you have to notice when you are going to do it and stop yourself from doing it.. it's best to go out of your way to defy the habit at first and then slowly return to your normal dealings.. and don't let it start back up
<prince-dari> >will connect you either to my server or Wrek's
<WhatPayne> Oh thanks a bunch
<prince-dari> >Wrek's server isn't up
<prince-dari> >good luck with that
<Wrek> 05you sure?
<prince-dari> Eeyup.
<FreezeFrame> That's why I gave the round-robin
<prince-dari> I just tried to connect, nothing.
<herospirit> Naw, It doesn't worry me. It's just kind of funny to me :P
<Wrek> 05my internet becasme spiky today
<MeteorVenture> ya i figured
<prince-dari> FreezeFrame: That's why you DON'T give the round robin
<Wrek> 05lemme restart
<prince-dari> It will try to connect to his server at random.
<DecapKing> also im not thinking about destroying the human race anymore
<FreezeFrame> dari: And on the second attempt it'll go to the other one.
<prince-dari> Not necessarily.
<Wrek> 05its up dari
<prince-dari> TTL is 4 hours for the DNS entry.
<FreezeFrame> Actually, a properly configured one won't see the down ones.
<MeteorVenture> when i was a kid i planned ways to kill my brother when i was really ticked off at him.. of course i never planned on actually doing them and i didn't
<FreezeFrame> e.g.: When Troika goes down on Nightstar, the round robin drops it out.
<RobotPinkie> Until today, MeteorVenture!
<MeteorVenture> lols
<FreezeFrame> Unfortunately, I don't know the technical details of setting up a round robin
<Nittany_Tiger> Does Wrek have permission from his ISP for a server?
<DecapKing> i already had how to destroy the human race figured out
<prince-dari> [18:30] -rainbow-dash.bronyserv.co.cc- *** Notice -- No response from fluttershy.bronyserv.co.cc, closing link
<WhatPayne> That's quite dark...
<prince-dari> Is it really Wrek? :P
<prince-dari> Close unreal and open it up again.
<Wrek> 05i jsut did
<MeteorVenture> nah i don't think of that anymore.. i also don't get ticked off at him anymore.. now i think about ways i can actually help the situation
<FreezeFrame> Links list still doesn't show fluttershy
*Pegacorn punches DecapKing
<Wrek> 05rebewting router
<Wrek> 05its been bitching at me all day
<FreezeFrame> Only rainbow-dash and services
<Wrek> 05time for revenge
<MeteorVenture> i don't get ticked off at him MUCH anymore.. lol
<Pegacorn> THIS IS FOR LEAVING ME CHAINED AT MOLESTIA'S HOUSE!
*DecapKing shoots Pegacorn
*Pegacorn dodges
*Pegacorn kicks DecapKing in the nuts
<DecapKing> fuck it
<Pegacorn> And that was because i'm evil.
<DecapKing> you arent worth my time
<MeteorVenture> that must have been back when i was like 7-11 or so
<MeteorVenture> oh how the days have.. gone so so slow
<FreezeFrame> What's funny about "/me dodges" is there's a comic book character whose power is exactly that.
<FreezeFrame> Judomaster from JSA. Her only metahuman power is that she can dodge any attack aimed at her.
<RobotPinkie> I used to get ticked off at my brother too
<MeteorVenture> but what if they're not aiming for her?
<MeteorVenture> AHA!
<FreezeFrame> A couple villains figured that out, but it does include stuff like "spray and pray" fire
<MeteorVenture> inb4 grammar nazi-ing doesn't get the kill
<MeteorVenture> dunno if that's called grammar though.. but anyway
<MeteorVenture> nukes will work
<FreezeFrame> explosions, too.
<prince-dari> Ok.
<Wrek> 05prince-dari i restarted the shit
<mib_3mfx20> .-.
<Wrek> 05lemme restart u
<FreezeFrame> Hmm... no +N yet
<Wrek> 05ok its back upa again
<prince-dari> >yet
<FreezeFrame> I know
<VioletVanilla> 6I'm going to find a nighttime snack, be right back ;3
<herospirit> So the Big Mac sprite is going well. I made his armor shiny. SO SHINY. Shinier = better, right?
<MeteorVenture> but what if she also had the power to fuse with anything? then she could fuse with what they are shooting at and dodge it
<RobotPinkie> Add some lens flares, bitches love lens flares
<prince-dari> It's not working any more Wrek.
<VioletVanilla> 6Pegacorn~ Where arreee yooouuuuu? ;D
<prince-dari> Still won't connect.
<Wrek> 05FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<VioletVanilla> 6I'm hungryyyyy~
<Wrek> 05-dge
<WhatPayne> uh +N?
<Pegacorn> WUT
<VioletVanilla> 6Is delicious!
<prince-dari> Did you reset the ports forwarded by accident?
<FreezeFrame> The mode that prevents nickchanges
<Wrek> 05lemme check
<WhatPayne> oh, right that was it.
<Wrek> 05for some fuckign reason my fucking router is fuckign up my fuciking computer. sorry for the vent. ill midn my language
<Wrek> 05*sigh*
<prince-dari> MFW Wrek broke his server in a day.
<prince-dari> I got it all working and synced not that long ago. ;_______;
<Pegacorn> I'M OVER HERE
<FreezeFrame> If my spare computer actually could stay up when jostled, I'd offer to do one from my house (obviously can't do one on campus wi-fi).
*DecapKing breaks Pegacorn's neck
<DecapKing> thats for kicking me in the balls
<MeteorVenture> i haven't even heard of that comic book char before and i figure out her secret in 10 seconds flat
<katooly> helloo
<WhatPayne> So in future we'll come here for Bronystate stuff?
<FreezeFrame> She's also a skilled martial artist, as you can guess by the name.
<Bot> hi katooly, just ask your (*Mibbit* related) question, if people can help they will answer, see also http://wiki.mibbit.com
*VioletVanilla 6trods up behind Pegacorn slowly~
<MeteorVenture> haha judomaster is her name?
<VioletVanilla> 6Theeerrreee you are my snacky pony friend~ <3
<FreezeFrame> Her hero name
<DecapKing> Violet i just killed Pegacorn
<FreezeFrame> She's actually the daughter of a WWII villain.
<Wrek> 05ports are still active
<Wrek> 05IP is the same
<MeteorVenture> what i would do is put on a blindfold and swing randomly
<Wrek> 05beurght
<sotha> hello?
<MeteorVenture> or close my eyes
<FreezeFrame> And get owned because she's still a judoka
<Pegacorn> I'm......still.....alive.......
<WhatPayne> Hello. I'm here.
<prince-dari> Hey.
<MeteorVenture> exactly
<MeteorVenture> but i'm super buff and unmoveable
*DecapKing shoots Pegacorn in the head with a 44. magnum
<DecapKing> not anymore
<VioletVanilla> 6:3 I am hungry as I did not have dinner, brb~
<MeteorVenture> and i'm a bomb
<FreezeFrame> Which is the coolest name for a practicioner of a martial art
<FreezeFrame> You aren't Damage, Meteor
<MeteorVenture> lol.. still have no clue who that is:P
<Pegacorn> Ow......that....hurt.....
<sotha> Wow. This is odd. It is like it's halfway between what was really wrong last night, and working fine. I can see the list of chatters as a drop down, but I can't see the chat itself. And it once again says 3538:15:51:45 until next stream.
<MeteorVenture> i'm just throwing out false info here
<sotha> So I am pretty sure you are actually getting these messages, but I can't see anything. Oh well.
<Pinkie_Pie> I fell to my death on terraria
<MeteorVenture> i've done that a few times
*Pegacorn stands back up
*Pegacorn punches DecapKing
<MeteorVenture> haha your skull has been crushed though pegacorn
<FreezeFrame> Okay, time to start up Word and work on writing stuff.
<FreezeFrame> After I take my laundry down two flights of stairs.
<katooly> hi,, how r u?
<MeteorVenture> if that wasn't a reference then just nevermind that last comment for a min
<FreezeFrame> laundry room on first floor, my room on 3rd floor. Go res halls!
*Pegacorn is bleeding,but alive
<lostcoast> *Mibbit* related) questions only thanks
<katooly> umm , i'm new here ,,,some one invite me to your chat
<herospirit> People need bandages.
<herospirit> BANDAGES
<katooly> and i cann't connect with him
<prince-dari> MFW it kicked me first.
<katooly> what happend
<katooly> ?
<DecapKing> Pegacorn, your skull was shattered
*herospirit produces bandages from his pants and throws them all over the place
<herospirit> BANDAAAAGEEEEEES
<lostcoast> use mibbit tab to search channels
<prince-dari> >_>
<DecapKing> you had a 44. magnum go through your brain, and your frontal lobe was completely destroyed
<FreezeFrame> >yfw you forgot to turn off auto-rejoin
<Pegacorn> I don't care Decap.
<katooly> how come??
<herospirit> Wat
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<DecapKing> XD
<DecapKing> Dari, we have figured out how magnets work
<MeteorVenture> if you think that song is amazing just wait till you hear an interview with those guys
<prince-dari> Lolwut
<DecapKing> THEY RUN ON FRIENDSHIP!
<herospirit> What is up with that Joker
<MeteorVenture> they're really dumb
<herospirit> That is not a good Joker :0
<E_N> It's still the Joker
<E_N> So he's automatically baws
<RobotPika> So is mibbit chat back/working now?
<herospirit> That is not right. This is wrong.
<Daz> whoa
<Daz> only 4 peeps?
<FreezeFrame> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8D3xnRoSnk
<prince-dari> Hey sotha.
<Daz> now 5 :P
<prince-dari> Hey Daz.
<Daz> ohai Dari.
<Daz> i'm a little : / rite now.
<sotha> It seems that when my computer, for some reason, decides that any https connection is untrustworthy, this chat is messed up as well...
<Pegacorn> What the hell was that?
<prince-dari> Me kicking everyone.
<prince-dari> So they'd refresh.
<prince-dari> Clearly I'll have to take a different approach.
<Daz> only just today in nightly roundup the 'Spain has Ponies' pic came out. I had a pic of that 2 weeks ago from when I bought mine. I guess i was one of the first Spanish Bronies to get Merch. : / I'm really regretting not sending in pics to EQD, as we could've had that 2 weeks ago in news : / : / : /
<DecapKing> what changed?
<prince-dari> Our IRC has changed.
<prince-dari> Refresh the page with F5.
<RobotPinkie> ohay guys
<prince-dari> Hey.
<Daz> ohey RobotPinkie. mfw just now Spanish Ponies in nightlyroundup.
<prince-dari> Now it's just me and ChanServ in the other channel.
<RobotPinkie> So is this the right one, or what?
<prince-dari> Eeyup.
<Daz> I should've taken your advice and send in pics to EQD
<RobotPinkie> Okay, cool
<Pegacorn> OK,I REFRESHED
<RobotPinkie> and hay Daz, I saw
<RobotPinkie> Also Swedish dub
<RobotPinkie> which truth be told was really bad except for two voices...
<Pegacorn> RANDOM VID:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPJUBQd-PNM&feature=related
<herospirit> Is this right? Did I refresh the page? :0
*NittanyTiger slaps prince-dari
<Daz> RobotPinkie, recognise the pics? they're identical to the ones i showed u 2 weeks ago ;__;
<prince-dari> Eeyup.
<prince-dari> Everyone's in the right place now.
<NittanyTiger> Chatzilla doesn't "refresh."
<RobotPinkie> Which pics, Daz?
<Daz> the ones i showed u about Toys R Us with the RD/rainbowflash and FS/daisydreams pics.
<RobotPinkie> Not sure I saw them on EQD...
<Daz> like, 2 or 3 weeks ago when i first got FS
<RobotPinkie> oh yeah
<Daz> nah but RobotPinkie they are the same products in the same Toys R Us shop.
<DecapKing> that was anoying
<Daz> ...there may be a Brony near me =D
<DecapKing> anyways the true meaning of life
<DecapKing> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXgZkY-OFjE&feature=related
<Nittany_Tiger> It might be a trap.
<RobotPinkie> That's pretty cool too, Daz
<Daz> RobotPinkie: gimme 2 secs ill sho u :P
<DecapKing> so wtf has changed with this?
<Dermathil> OHAI DAZ
<prince-dari> We're on a new IRC server.
<Daz> Sup Bro
<RobotPinkie> server has changed
<prince-dari> Well, new network.
<Pegacorn> May i take your hat sir?
*Dermathil doesn't see Prince-Dari in the list of people on the channel
<Nittany_Tiger> No.
<Dermathil> o_o
<Nittany_Tiger> I don't wear hats.
*Pinkie_Pie looks around
<Pinkie_Pie> Is it safe now?
<Pegacorn> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KL2HafxlRw4&feature=related
<Daz> ok RobotPinkie CHECK THIS OUT. Pics of EQD post about ponies in spain toysrus: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-J7CsgK1aYCM/TmM_rflmcMI/AAAAAAAALgo/_p-bYVwvXWk/s1600/Spanish%2BMLPFiM%2BToys.jpg NOW, this is by someotherdude. these are MY PICS: http://i.imgur.com/yPApp.jpg and http://i.imgur.com/niFqk.jpg :O :O :O Same everything! there's a brony near me!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<prince-dari> Nope.
<prince-dari> You're on the wrong server.
<prince-dari> irc.bronyserv.co.cc
<prince-dari> Go there.
<prince-dari> If you're using mibbit on the site, you still haven't refreshed the page.
<Daz> I MUST LOCATE AND BROFIST THIS GUY
<Pinkie_Pie> I see
<RobotPinkie> Well, I'd guess more than one brony near you, but that's very cool.
<Zephirdd> good luck with that Daz :P
<Pegacorn> MAY I TAKE YOUR HAT SIR?
<Pegacorn> MAY I-
<Daz> thanks, Zephirdd
<Evotrooper61> HI
<Pegacorn> Alright i've heard enough.You got the job.
<sotha> Hey bronies. Were you getting my messages from before?
<Zephirdd> No
<Daz> eeeenope?
<Zephirdd> because I wasnt here
<Zephirdd> :)
<Nittany_Tiger> No.
<Evotrooper61> 3So is this where all the awesome comes?
<Daz> "It seems that when my computer, for some reason, decides that any https connection is untrustworthy, this chat is messed up as well..." last I saw
<MeteorVenture> refreshing didn't help.. i had to close the window and open a new one
<RobotPinkie> Refreshing definitely doesn't help, had to clear the cache completely and restart the browser...
<Daz> orly?
<sotha> Oh okay. Yeah. The chat was messed up for me. It was like that last night, when I was first setting my new desktop up, and then everything inadvertently started working perfectly. But when I turned it on this morning (about an hour ago), it was back to the way it was.
<Daz> i just came on right now and i was fine
<RobotPinkie> Coming in AFTER it's changed obviously isn't a problem
<prince-dari> Refreshing does work.
<prince-dari> I know, because I tested it.
<Daz> oh yea Dermathil NEW DOCTOR WHO dari IT'S MATT SMITH
<prince-dari> So?
<prince-dari> I've seen it, his acting was more wooden than the dolls in that episode.
<Daz> o u
<Daz> so imma grab it in 720p, turn on projector and bowers&wilkins speakers, and WATCH TI
<Pegacorn> http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/photos/images/original/000/133/993/a53b7bb8f179a85d1c55b564fb060e5320110725-22047-1caxuy.jpg?1311574181
<Pegacorn> BAM
<Daz> THERE IT IS
<RobotPinkie> I tried hard refresh, and it didn't work. Probably is highly dependent on browser and version.
<Daz> probs
<Nittany_Tiger> Refresh harder.
<RobotPinkie> That's what clearing cache is.
<MeteorVenture> do a hard refresh AKA reformat
<Daz> Refresh deeper.
<Daz> :P
<MeteorVenture> a refresh within a refresh
<Daz> go deeper! leave our multiverse for another, buy a brand new comp, and then refresh :P
<RobotPinkie> Some people aren't going to be able to just come right back after a refresh, was my only point.
<Dermathil> GUYS
<Dermathil> GUYS
<Dermathil> GUYS
<prince-dari> Hmm, pony meetup in the UK.
<prince-dari> Birmingham.
<prince-dari> XD
<RobotPinkie> Been listening to this all day http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFWpr_wkgV8
<Dermathil> Extra Creditz: they got their hands on a brony Artist again
<Daz> Go dari
<E_N> I like that, but I think Flutterwonder is better
<mib_be254k> Well, sotha, this definitely isn't working. I have no idea why the browser started working well last night. Perhaps it has to do with the windows firewall, blocking https connections or something.
<RobotPinkie> Both are great, I think
<Daz> Flutterwonder is pinkiepieswear's best work imo
<RobotPinkie> I've been mixing in a bit of Flutterwonder, Proud to be a Brony, Pony Swag and so on in between.
<E_N> All very good songs
<E_N> I try to listen to Makkon quite a bit
<RobotPinkie> Not sure I've heard any of that
<Pegacorn> OF COURSE!
<VioletVanilla> 6:3 I will be back for you Pegacorn~
<solthas> Okay. What if I copied the windows firewall on my laptop onto a flashdrive, then replaced the windows firewall on my desktop with the one from my laptop. . .?
<prince-dari> Oh yeah.
<DecapKing> idk where birmingham is lol
<Flutterguy> And the chanting
<Daz> Firewall :3
<solthas> daz?
<Flutterguy> :D MR GREEN SHALL TAKE OVER
<solthas> Through the Eyes of another pony?
<Daz> Oh, i mean that in a ponyfanfic, called 'through the eyes of another pony,' the Protagonist is called Firewall :3
<Daz> eyup solthas =]
<solthas> Yeah. I like his name.
<DecapKing> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-sonic-rainboom.jpg
<RobotPinkie> Birmingham makes sense for a UK meetup, I guess...
<Daz> Pony Out!
<herospirit> SONIC (rain)BOOM
<Daz> (Punch Out!)
<RobotPinkie> lol DecapKing
<solthas> But seriously though, is there anypony here with knowledge of computers and whatnot who can tell me that I'm doing it wrong and will cause spontaneous oatmealation of my computer?
<DecapKing> huh no reaction from Dari
<Nittany_Tiger> My laptop is acting funny.
<solthas> (and yes. Oatmealation is totally a word.)
<Daz> well, solthas, Dari is both a mod, and a techwiz. too bad he's also semiafk.
<prince-dari> I don't understand the picture.
<solthas> That makes me sad... because I'm going to try it anyway. I just need to find where wf.msc is...
<Pegacorn> SONIC BOOM
<Daz> google is a powerful tool
<solthas> SONIC BOOM! That's hilarious
<DecapKing> its guile using RBD as a finishing move
<Nittany_Tiger> solthas: What's up with your PC (can't find it from reading above)?
<Daz> Well duh
<prince-dari> I don't know who Guile is.
<Daz> Darius, have you heard of a videogame? :P
<solthas> I've been looking on google, about https being randomly blocked, and 0xc0000142 not starting, and if it's the firewall. . . but I'm not sure.
<DecapKing> charecter from Street Fighter
<prince-dari> All I know is his theme goes with everything.
<prince-dari> I don't play street fighter.
<Natleyn> Guile!
<Daz> ah, so you haven't been in a cave the last few years xD
<prince-dari> I just don't like that kind of fighting game.
<prince-dari> I think they're pretty boring.
<Nittany_Tiger> I guess you tried every browser you can think of to see if it was browser-related.
<prince-dari> Huh?
<solthas> Nittany_Tiger: I'm in the middle of transferring everything from my laptop to my new desktop, and for some reason, any browser I used automatically blocked https connections, and the BMN chat be messed up (a blank blue screen, though for some reason this time I can contribute to it, but can't see the chat box itself.)
<Nittany_Tiger> Tried another browser?
<Daz> that, solthas, happened to me when I used I.E. the other day. I use Chrome, and it's fine. try other browsers / reinstalling (for latest versions) browsers. we need ta make sure it isn't the browser before beginning hax0rz on firewalls
<DecapKing> I USE ZE FIREFOX!!
<solthas> Nittany_Tiger: The problem was randomly fixed sometime when I was trying to install PC Tools free antivirus, which didn't work ("The application aws unable to start correctly (0xc0000142).")... Yes, I tried IE, Firefox, Chrome, and Iron (which uses the Chromium open source thing).
<Nittany_Tiger> Ok.
<Pegacorn> THAT PYRO IS A SPY!
<WhatPayne> Ohey now we're here. Cool
<Daz> ok, Pegacorn, seriously. stop making TF2 and L4D2 jokes only.
<RobotPinkie> wtf is this My Little Moomin or something? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GdfAoE9__g
<Dermathil> guys
<Dermathil> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jl4cNQXsSvA
<DecapKing> RAMIREZ FIGURE OUT THIS COMPUTER PROBLEM!
<Pegacorn> There was somepony in the chat that was called PinkyPyro,so i just had to do that joke.
<Dermathil> this thing has a few mlp images
<solthas> So then I installed Microsoft Security Essentials, and when I went back to the Internets, everything was working perfectly.
<RobotPinkie> how's your flootershai, btw, Daz?
<Daz> RobotPinkie: still not had 2nd attempt. busy with, now, applying for schools, as I just moved from UK to Spain.
<Daz> but i have 4 poni now
*Dermathil goes back to watching the adventures of the TARDIS.
<DecapKing> what is it with you and Dr. Who Dermathil?
<RobotPinkie> Ah okay, well at least you have 4 ponies
<Daz> what is it with you and not interacting with us, yet posting vids you expect us to actually watch, and always using 3rd person just to say something?
<solthas> But then, when I came back to it this morning, https was blocked again, and the BMN chat is almost as bad as it was when I first started (this time the #BronyState tab shows up at the top, though it's covered by an ad, and the viewer list appears as a drop down, and I can actually write things, but can't see the chat. . . And there's an annoying blue bg to it
*RobotPinkie tries to brush his molded ponies, but fails
<Daz> Lawl silly pony
<solthas> . . . And it says, for the https, by the way, (It says "The server's security certificate is not yet valid!" by the way, which leads me to think that there is something wrong with the certificate validator on my computer, whatever that is.)
<solthas> (bad grammar there)
<Wrek> 05prince-dari
<Wrek> 05i think i fixed it
<Dermathil> DecapKing: I am a big Dr Who geek. That's what.
<Daz> well, solthas, we have a mod in the room, but hey, since when did mods help out nonmods as much as nonmods help nonmods?
<DecapKing> wait how many Dr. Who seasons are there anyway?
<Natleyn> A lot.
<Dermathil> Daz, the mods help the non-mods they are the most friends with.
<Dermathil> DecapKing: 25+ seasons, 6 series
<Natleyn> ^I rest my case
<Dermathil> (series being the seasons of the 20005 comeback)
<Daz> Dermathil, oh i see, so only if you're friends will you receive help(!) whereas we just help anyone who comes here, like, you know, it should be
<Dermathil> exactly
<Daz> wikipasta: "26 (1963–89) plus one TV film (1996) "
<DecapKing> damn thats a lot
<Dermathil> xD
<Dermathil> eeeyup.
<Daz> 25+ seasons. 26 seasons, nice catch, bro
<Daz> 20,005 lawl
<Dermathil> The main character has been portrayed by at least 11 different actors when not counting the non-canonical episodes with other actors
<Dermathil> hehehe, I told ya I know my stuff, Daz.
<Daz> BEAN
<Daz> and ya sure do Dermathil !
<Dermathil> hehehe
<Dermathil> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_8FEjV6pBo
<Daz> "ah, but you see i go back in time and bribe the architect for a trap" "ah, but you see i also go back in time, and pay him double to move the trap"
<Daz> seen dat Dermathil, but this other one is far better
<Daz> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3qS0odekuU
<RobotPinkie> If you can name all those actors without using Wikipedia, then I'm impressed.
<DecapKing> "4, no, 3
<Daz> which actors, RobotPinkie ?
<Daz> oh, the doctors?
<RobotPinkie> Yep.
<RobotPinkie> I don't know more than 4 by heart, so... I keep forgetting the names of the other guys.
<RobotPinkie> Didn't really watch anything but the Tom Baker Doctor when I was growing up.
<sotha> Where is nittany_tiger?
<Daz> not here
<sotha> He thinks there was a network split.
<sotha> or something
<RobotPinkie> Oh... so there are now two different bronystates?
<sotha> My desktop solthas chatter is in the bronystate chat, and he is the only other one there. But my laptop sotha is here.
<sotha> I suppose.
<sotha> He's on fluttershy. We're on rainbowdash
<RobotPinkie> weird...
<Daz> not really, RobotPinkie. it's part of their expansion plan. 6 channels for mane6, to have many bronies for future BMN and S02
<RobotPinkie> I'd prefer to be on Fluttershy :(
<sotha> Yeah... but how do we get back...
<Daz> i'd prefer to be on with people I know.
<Wrek> 05hi DCD
<RobotPinkie> Ah... So it's a gamble which one we get on, pretty much?
<NewDCD> yo
<Daz> well i guess, but Darius' plan is to have us pick when we come onto Bronystate
<RobotPinkie> Same here, Daz
<Daz> it's still not finished, i guess
<NewDCD> so no migration yet?
<prince-dari> Yeah, we did.
<prince-dari> Ahh
<prince-dari> Nice one Wrek.
<NittanyTiger> The servers here aren't synced.
<prince-dari> Yeah, it's working now.
<NewDCD> what's the new server address?
<Daz> nope
<prince-dari> [20:03] -rainbow-dash.bronyserv.co.cc- *** Notice -- Link fluttershy.bronyserv.co.cc -> rainbow-dash.bronyserv.co.cc is now synced [secs: 12 recv: 0.740 sent: 1.702]

<solthas> oh hello there
<NittanyTiger> fluttershy isn't synched with rainbow-dash.
<Nittany_Tiger> Now it is.
<NewDCD> k
<prince-dari> Everyone needs to reregister their nicks of course.
*solthas glomps sotha. "I've missed you! You're like my other half!"
<Daz> D: can't /server here?
<Daz> ffs, i cba to open up mIRC
<NittanyTiger> Never tried.
<prince-dari> Please don't choose one of the servers.
<prince-dari> Connect to the round robin.
<RobotPinkie> Not sure what that even means for the future.
<NittanyTiger> I do.
<Daz> why can't I join the other mane6 servers?
<NittanyTiger> But it put me on a split server
<prince-dari> So users will be distributed more efficiently.
<prince-dari> Daz: They don't exist
<prince-dari> We only have two servers.
<RobotPinkie> So we'll all still talk in the same room, I gather?
<NittanyTiger> Yes.
<prince-dari> Not exactly.
<NewDCD> >Current Global Users: 31
<NewDCD> >Max: 31
<prince-dari> For S2 the system will have changed.
<Daz> still just epicchat and this new one? no other mane6 yet? Rainbow Dash is the best pony? So wrong :P
<NewDCD> that's what the Chanserv status just told me
<Nittany_Tiger> I don't think we need 6 servers yet.
<prince-dari> So DCD?
<RobotPinkie> So I won't see the people I want to see, necessarily?
<prince-dari> Nittany_Tiger: Lawl, for S2 we might.
<NewDCD> yeah Nittany
<prince-dari> Not sure our 2 servers can handle 4000+ people.
<prince-dari> Which is why we need to do a stress test.
<Flutteryay> Twilight Sparkle is best pony...
<Nittany_Tiger> Hmm.
<NewDCD> we WILL need the six rooms for S2
<Flutteryay> (just my opinion)
<Wrek> 05back
<Wrek> 05ok
<Wrek> 05so
<Wrek> 05prince-dari
<Pegacorn> And then BOOM
<Nittany_Tiger> Wish my ISP would allow me to run a server.
<prince-dari> Yes?
<NewDCD> dari
<Wrek> 05its working? :3
<Nittany_Tiger> But I couldn't hold many people on a 15Mbps connection anyway.
<NewDCD> I have an idea
<Nittany_Tiger> Well, 20
<prince-dari> Eeyup.
<Nittany_Tiger> Would love to run one anyway since it would be a fun adventure in server coding.
<NewDCD> Nittany: but 20 Mbps is rather high
<prince-dari> >Can't hold many people on a 15Mbps connection
<prince-dari> My upload is 1mbps.
<prince-dari> I'm hosting a server.
<Wrek> 05shall i join there instead then?
<prince-dari> :P
<Nittany_Tiger> Mine is 3.
<NewDCD> that said
<NewDCD> Dari
<Nittany_Tiger> Ok then.
<NewDCD> depending on our stress test results
<NewDCD> we should probably hire an IRC Staff Division
<solthas> Apparently, having your global date and time settings set to 2001 can really mess things up...
<prince-dari> An IRC staff division?
<Nittany_Tiger> Then I'll throw a new hard drive onto my old Linux box and you'll have a free computer.
<RobotPinkie> So apart from server load, will this affect the chat?
<prince-dari> To do what?
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Pegacorn> brb
<NewDCD> to host the server(s)
<NewDCD> That way you and Sathi could stream and not worry about the servers
<Dermathil> NEWDCD!!!
<Dermathil> How are you today man?
<prince-dari> There's a reason I'd rather not do that.
<Wrek> 05okie
<NewDCD> well, it's probably not a good idea
<NewDCD> but should push come to shove, we should consider it
<Nittany_Tiger> My ISP can't see that I'm running a server, and I have a download cap, but otherwise I'm happy to spare what I don't use.
<NewDCD> also Dermathil: le busy ;__;
<Dermathil> I'm sad that you didn't manage to do the Saturday Night Robot Show, DCD. But OH well! There's plenty of Saturday nights left in the calendar. (and I'm shutting up now, so I'm saying everything right now)
<Daz> so only fluttershy and rainbow dash directories exist, and even then only Rainbow Dash chatroom exists? D: Where's my beloved Twilight?
<NewDCD> yeah, no GR Saturday Night till S2
<NewDCD> we'll make up for it that day though
<prince-dari> Daz: If Val gets his desktop so he can host a server, his would be caramel. XD
<NewDCD> the GL Movies + Mazinkaiser SKL
<prince-dari> What do you mean only Dash chatroom exists?
<Daz> true dat. but still, Y u no make the best pony channel first? xD
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm on fluttershy
<NewDCD> hmmm
<Daz> Nittany_Tiger, I cna't get onto fluttershy : /
<NewDCD> I wonder
<Wrek> 05the hell dari
<Wrek> 05im banned :o
<NewDCD> Oh yeah IDK if you heard
<Daz> fluttershy.bronyserv.co.cc ?
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<NewDCD> but if you have an Android/Windows Mobile/iPhone
<Dermathil> what about Eureka 7 though NewDCD? Oh wait, no, I can probably manage to use a website I found yesterday to find all the episodes
<solthas> but I was moved to dash?
<Daz> i can't get on Nittany_Tiger. : /
<Daz> ah well i g2g now bai all
<Natleyn> Bye Daz :'<
<NewDCD> Dermathil: post-S2 premiere we'll go back to regular programming
<NewDCD> It's just that S2 preparation has taken all of my free time, which is really sparse
<Dermathil> >mfw searching for Eureka 7 on that website gives me BOTH EUReKA and Eureka 7 to watch
<RobotPinkie> bai Daz
<Dermathil> http://www.letmewatchthis.ch/watch-5142-Eureka I remember this show being hilarious
<Nittany_Tiger> I'll lend my old PC to an IRC server. Please consider. I would enjoy some coding outside of C and Perl.
<Wrek> 05there
<Nittany_Tiger> And I can control it from anything with a remote terminal.
<Dermathil> I also remember this show that I'll need to convince Sathi to stream someday: http://www.letmewatchthis.ch/watch-5117-Chuck
<Dermathil> CHUCK!
<prince-dari> I watch Chuck.
<prince-dari> You watch all the same shows as me Dermathil.
<Dermathil> hehehehe lawl Dari
<Nittany_Tiger> Ooh, Eureka.
<Dermathil> *flashes*
<Nittany_Tiger> Good show when I remember to catch it.
<Wrek> 05ok
<Wrek> 05now wyhat
<prince-dari> Now all our mods need to reregister their nicks.
<Dermathil> hehehe
<prince-dari> Also, if I find anyone's registered a nick that's not theirs, I'll server ban you permenantly.
<NewDCD> I'll register mine later
<NewDCD> I need to know something, now
<Zephirdd> wait, we can register our nicks?
<NewDCD> quick
<prince-dari> Of course Zephirdd.
<NewDCD> who of you have
<Zephirdd> *oblivious irc user*
<NewDCD> an Android/WindowsPhone/iPhone handy?
<Denied_Existence> Hello.
<Pegacorn> I'm back!
<prince-dari> Hey.
<Natleyn> Hiya
<Denied_Existence> Hey Pegacorn, hey dari
<Pegacorn> Ohai son
<OnlyRainbowDash> hiya
<NewDCD> anybody have an Android here?
<OnlyRainbowDash> nope
<NewDCD> my Kingdom for a non-BB Smartphone user!
<Zephirdd> prince-dari: how do you do it? :D
<RobotPinkie> yeah, I have an Android phone
<OnlyRainbowDash> how is everypony?
<Nittany_Tiger> I have an android.
<RobotPinkie> old one, though
*Dermathil thinks he could probably manage to register his nick
<Nittany_Tiger> Droid 2 Global.
<NewDCD> RobotPinkie
<Denied_Existence> I have an iPhone myself
<NewDCD> can you stick around for a while?
<NewDCD> Denied
<NewDCD> you guys
<Denied_Existence> Yeah, you probably could Dermathil
<OnlyRainbowDash> me has iphone
<Denied_Existence> Yeah
<Dermathil> heheheheeh
<NewDCD> you're perfect for testing our new service
<RobotPinkie> Sure, why NewDCD?
<Denied_Existence> I got plenty of time
<OnlyRainbowDash> so, whose ready fo that season 2?
<NewDCD> Gonna test the feasibility of a Mobile Stream
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm not going anywhere.
<Denied_Existence> Oh?
<NewDCD> hold on a sec
<Denied_Existence> Well the chat doesn't work on my iphone
<Denied_Existence> The stream might though
<NewDCD> here
<NewDCD> no, not that
<NewDCD> you'll need this app
<Dermathil> Denied, fun fact: stream don't work on my iPod Touch but chat does
<NewDCD> grab the one corresponding to you
<NewDCD> http://www.ustream.tv/everywhere
<NewDCD> also, Phone Users, what speeds are you rocking?
<Dermathil> >mfw TTGL the 1st movie is classes as part of Season 2 of Gurren Lagannon the website where I can find any tv show
<NewDCD> in your Phones I mean
<Denied_Existence> I have 3G outside of my house, inside I have broadband wifi
<NewDCD> Stay on 3G
<Zephirdd> Yay I'm registered now :D
<prince-dari> Wrek: /cycle #bronystate
<RobotPinkie> 3G
<prince-dari> Do eet.
<Denied_Existence> Lemme download it in wifi first, then I will switch wifi off
<NewDCD> 3G is going to be our standard for Mobile- LQ
<RobotPinkie> Not sure Ustream will work for me...
<prince-dari> Wrek
<prince-dari> Wrek
<prince-dari> Wrek
<prince-dari> Wrek
<prince-dari> Wrek
<prince-dari> Wrek
<NewDCD> HQ will run on 3.5G standard
<NewDCD> RobotPinkie: why?
<Denied_Existence> Also DCD, I may not be able to stream S2 unless I can figure out how to make my mac record my desktop
<RobotPinkie> Old Android, but we'll see
<Zephirdd> btw, whoever is streaming, which kind of program are you intending to use?
<NewDCD> hold on a sec
<Denied_Existence> Alright, my wifi is off.
<NewDCD> Denied can stream?
<Denied_Existence> Mabye
<Denied_Existence> But only if I can figure out how to record my screen on my mac
<Barry> hi
<prince-dari> Hey.
<NewDCD> Denied: I believe VHScrCap works on Mac
<Barry> How are you, Dari?
<Denied_Existence> So far it hasn't been very willing to do such
<prince-dari> Good thanks, and yourself?
<Denied_Existence> Really? Link?
<Barry> Doing good. I'm all settled in from moving
<VioletVanilla> 6:3
<Pegacorn> OHGOD!
<VioletVanilla> 6;3
<NewDCD> Zephirdd: clever combination of Adobe FME, VHScrCap and uStream for Mobile Streams
<VioletVanilla> 6Ohai there Pegacorn~
<Natleyn> Hi Violet! :3
<VioletVanilla> 6Hallo Natleyn!
<Zephirdd> NewDCD: have you considered using Xsplit broadcaster?
<NewDCD> so yeah
<NewDCD> for those of you that didn't know
<Zephirdd> It's widely used on gaming communities
<NewDCD> Zephir: XSplit's propietary broadcaster won't achieve my NewOCD quality and optimizational standards
<Zephirdd> ohh I see
<prince-dari> NewOCD. XD
<prince-dari> Too true.
<Zephirdd> :P
<NewDCD> also keep in mind VHScrCap is basically the standalone, screen capture software used by XSplit
<NewDCD> Since the XSplit Company bought Hyemeloff Labs
<DecapKing> hey violet
<Zephirdd> really? I had no idea :O
<Denied_Existence> NewDCD Whenever I download the VHSC inst.exe all that comes up is a doc with a bunch of symbols
<VioletVanilla> 6Hallo DecapKing~
<Denied_Existence> Like:Ú\;cµÈÃ
<Zephirdd> I just suggested it because I have little to no troubles streaming with good quality out of a 1Mpbs upload
<Denied_Existence> And stuff like that
<NewDCD> there was actually a quack school psychologist (actually a sexologist) who diagnosed me with OCD and prescribed Ritalin for me as a kid
<DecapKing> what?
<VioletVanilla> 6D: Poor DCD
<NewDCD> my uncle, a doctor himself, opposed
<NewDCD> We're glad he did, cause those meds fuck your shit up
<Zephirdd> wait, what does OCD stands for?
<NewDCD> also it was just because
<DecapKing> I take Adderal
<Denied_Existence> Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
<Wrek> 05there
<NewDCD> "Okay boy let's talk about what you like"
<Zephirdd> oh
<RobotPinkie> So yeah, I have ustream viewer installed.
<Zephirdd> I do know that Ritalin fucks one up
<Zephirdd> my brother had to take it due to ADD
<Denied_Existence> NewDCD the VHScrCap isn't working on my mac.
<DecapKing> Ritalin didnt work for me at all
<prince-dari> Trololo
<Wrek> 05pony?
<Denied_Existence> NewDCD all that comes up is a document full of symbols
<NewDCD> "MISTER I LOVE VIDEO GAMES I PLAYED PAPER MARIO A FEW DAYS AGO AND IT WAS SO AWESOME HOW MARIO'S HAMMER GOES SWOOOSHH AND BAM AND CRUNK!"
<Denied_Existence> Which I suppose is the coding that would run the program
<Zephirdd> lol
<DecapKing> what are you talking about DCD?
<NewDCD> So he prescribed that, but my family went "No fuck that shit"
<NewDCD> wanna know the greatest irony, though?
<DecapKing> i acted like i was on crack when i was little lol
<NewDCD> Decap: when I was diagnosed with OCD as a kid but it was a serious misdiagnosis
<DecapKing> i have ADHD
<NewDCD> well
<NewDCD> that diagnosis, I was like, 8?
<Zephirdd> sounds like a normal 8 yo for me
<Zephirdd> :|
<NewDCD> and then
<Denied_Existence> Your a lucky bastard NewDCD, I was "Diagnosed with OCD" and my control freak of a father went nuts. I took Zoloft for years.
<DecapKing> trust me if you would see me when my Aderal wears off
<NewDCD> when I graduated High School (about 17)
<Denied_Existence> It really fucked up my mind
<NewDCD> that man calls
<prince-dari> VioletVanilla: Rejoin the channel
<prince-dari> :)
<VioletVanilla> 6(:
<prince-dari> >rejoin channel
<DecapKing> Hai VioletVanilla
<prince-dari> >quits servers
<Wrek> 05mfw i dunno what OCD is
<prince-dari> XD
<prince-dari> INB4 VV
<NewDCD> "The school has asked me to inform you that we're extending a fully-paid Commerce scholarship for Diego in Turkey, complete with food, lodging and supplies! For you see, he truly is a brilliant young man, one that makes us here in the school proud!"
<DecapKing> Hai VioletVanilla
<prince-dari> MFW so many people don't know what OCD is.
<Zephirdd> Wrek: Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
<prince-dari> O_o
<VioletVanilla> :3 Thank you Decap~
<NewDCD> I was like "AHAHAHA OH WOW'
<Zephirdd> I do know what it is, I just didnt know the english acronym
<DecapKing> some people think i have OCD
<DecapKing> but i dont
<prince-dari> LOL
<DecapKing> its just a side effect of my adderal
<prince-dari> I know what to put into our MOTD.
<prince-dari> "Dash is best pony".
<Zephirdd> LOL
<Wrek> 05Zephirdd no still doesnt mkae sense
<herospirit> I have OCD. :0
<DecapKing> Filly Celestia is best <censored>

<prince-dari> Mwuahahahahahahaha
<RobotPinkie> I have a PS3, does that count?
<Natleyn> Hi Luna :3
<DecapKing> XD
*Zephirdd hugs Luna
<DecapKing> Hai Luna
<NewDCD> also Decap
<RobotPinkie> ohay Luna
*DecapKing hugs Luna
<NewDCD> did you ever purchase EasyCap?
*Wrek hugs Luna
<DecapKing> wait, i was supposed to purchase something?
<Pegacorn> Dcap,umad?
<NewDCD> oh
<DecapKing> i have bad memory
<Pegacorn> *Decap
<NewDCD> that means we didn't finish your testing, most likely
<DecapKing> from repeated head injury
<NewDCD> easyCap is the capture device for S2
<prince-dari> NewDCD: I'm gunna edit an IRC module so that we have a channel mode that strips colours, underlines, and italics from all text from non-mods.
<DecapKing> is it a physical thing?
<NewDCD> Also
<NewDCD> everyone with compatible phones
<prince-dari> Just because then we don't need a script to kick people all the time.
<NewDCD> get in here http://www.ustream.tv/everywhere and get those
<NewDCD> Groovy
<NewDCD> do it
<NewDCD> Sathi
<NewDCD> PM me s'I'll vous plait
<DecapKing> all of those little bastards?
<RobotPinkie> got it from market, NewDCD, not jailbroken
<DecapKing> oh not me
<NewDCD> that's fine
<RobotPinkie> Seems to work either way
<NewDCD> just get the app
<NewDCD> it's supposed to be free, after all
<NewDCD> also you guys
<Denied_Existence> Fuck da jailbreakas
<NewDCD> I'm getting a Galaxy Ace soon
<Pegacorn> DecapKing,waddaya mean by "Filly Celestia is best *CENSORED*"?
<DecapKing> XD
<NewDCD> so I'll actually do a cultural/educational stream from there
<NewDCD> gonna stream this ugly yet beautiful country's many facets
<NewDCD> and you're coming with me in this adventure
<DecapKing> what country would that be?
<RobotPinkie> sounds very erotic, NewDCD
<Denied_Existence> Aggggghhhh fuck you connection
<VioletVanilla> 6It's only that way if PrincessMolestia is coming too~ ;D
<Pegacorn> OHGOD
<NewDCD> I'm thinking of this original, BronyState programming as "Bronies Around the World"
<NewDCD> Basically Bronies from different places would stream their surroundings and take us with them in and adventure
<NewDCD> Panama, over here
<Zephirdd> Brazil!
<Zephirdd> <
<VioletVanilla> 6Pegacorn~
<Denied_Existence> Texas down here.

<Barry> I'm watching a video that has the Pinkie Pie Nyan thing going for a full hour, but it's just 12 minutes in and annoying
<Dashite> Damn you ChanServ! I got in first last time! And you took away my OP!
<DecapKing> blue screen?
<prince-dari> Just started getting them today. >__>
<RobotPinkie> Wow, so you're running the server on your desktop computer?
<Apokalipse> Hey Dashite.
<RobotPinkie> lol I got the same message, Dashite
<Dashite> Hey
<Barry> Hi Dashite
<prince-dari> "driver_irql_not_less_or_equal"
<DecapKing> Hai again VioletVanilla
<prince-dari> ^ Suddenly getting that message in BSoDs.
<DecapKing> i dont get that at all
<Dashite> So, question, why are we switching servers?
<prince-dari> 200 people in chat max on the other server.
<prince-dari> And we've always planned to switch to our own network at some point.
<Apokalipse> neat
<DecapKing> do you really want 200+ people in one chat?
<Pegacorn> What was that about?
<prince-dari> But now I've got to find out what's wrong with my computer.
<DecapKing> the internet doesnt like you i guess
<prince-dari> Faulty RAM, drivers that need updating, etc. >_>
<E_N> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=BUw_ij8-xNU
<E_N> OH GOD, Eurobeat sea ponies!

<VioletVanilla> error*
<DecapKing> *ewww
<FreezeFrame> I usually got BSoDs with overheats
<E_N> I usually get BSoDs with, oh wait I never get blue screens
<RobotPinkie> Nice, finally Sea Ponies get some love
<DecapKing> FUUUUUU TECHNO!
<E_N> WHERE'S VAL, I NEED TO TROLL HIM
<Apokalipse> That Sea ponies video is great
<prince-dari> VioletVanilla: I'll get it.
<DecapKing> QUIT TRYING TO TROLL ME WITH POP AND TECHNO!
<prince-dari> 1 minute.
<RobotPinkie> Have you made a picture of Caramel sea pony?
<RobotPinkie> That's so not cool...
<VioletVanilla> Okay, thank you.

<Denied_Existence> ...
<prince-dari> I didn't get any messages like that.
<Barry> I don't understand all that techno mumbo-jumbo
<prince-dari> Though I did break a USB port recently.
<Dashite> LUNA!
<DecapKing> me either
<Barry> Hi Luna!
<prince-dari> (Which I'm still using, even though it's broken :P)
<VioletVanilla> Okay Dari, PM real quick.
<RobotPinkie> That sounds like hardware malfunction....
<Barry> Aw, she's gone!
<prince-dari> Sure.
<Dashite> Sathi is still here though.
<Wrek> 05back
<Dashite> You can't hide from me!
<E_N> RobotPinkie, even though it says his driver caused the problem?
<E_N> or a driver?
*Wrek successfully hides from Dashite
<FreezeFrame> hardware malfunctions can cause driver malfunctions
<Dashite> Eeeenope
<Denied_Existence> Hmm...weird...
<Pegacorn> Ohai DE
<Denied_Existence> For some reason it is telling me my nick isn't registerd
<RobotPinkie> Myeah, hardware driver throwing a fit can imply hardware is throwing a fit...
<FreezeFrame> D_E: New server
<Dashite> Because we are on a new server Denied\
<FreezeFrame> You have to register again.
<Denied_Existence> Oh...well then
<RobotPinkie> I don't know much about Windows drivers, for obvious reasons.
<Apokalipse> How exactly do you break a USB port?
<Dashite> You wire it backwards. >_<
<Wrek> 05^
<Denied_Existence> Ok
<Denied_Existence> Fixed it
<Apokalipse> neat
<Dashite> Or you could damage the connectors if you aren't careful with how to take things in and out.
<Apokalipse> ...that's what she said?
<Dashite> No, that's what he said.
<Denied_Existence> *Facehoof*
<Barry> At first I was confused by that nickname change, until I saw the underscore of the first one
<Pegacorn> And then i was ignored.
<Barry> Sorry, Pega
<Dashite> Did someone say something?
<Dashite> I thought I saw movement in the chat, but I guess not.
<Barry> Dashite, that wasn't nice
<Barry> neither was that
<Dashite> >_>
<Barry> Remember the saying: if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all
<Denied_Existence> *FacehoofX2COMBO!*
<Dashite> But then I'd never be able to say anything!
<Apokalipse> haha
<Barry> lol
*RobotPinkie has a fever
<Dashite> Dance fever?
<Barry> sorry to hear that RP
<RobotPinkie> No, fever as in coming down with a bad cold fever :P
<Dashite> Aw, that's not nearly as much fun.
<Apokalipse> I prefer the dance kind of fever myself
<RobotPinkie> I took some ibuprofen, that should help
<RobotPinkie> Otherwise the only thing that could cure me is more cowbell
<E_N> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4royOLtvmQ
<E_N> There you go
<RobotPinkie> and thanks Barry, I'll be alright in a couple of days.
<Pegacorn> MORE COWBELL
<RobotPinkie> lol thanks E_N
<Pegacorn> And then VioletVanilla returned.
<VioletVanilla> I have returned my subjects. (:
<VioletVanilla> 6How is everypony?
<Pegacorn> Subjects?
<Denied_Existence> I am no subject
<RobotPinkie> I think I'm going to lay down and wallow in whatever it is bronies with a fever are supposed to wallow in... and watch some ponies, too.
<Dashite> 4So is the colour script up yet?
<Dashite> 0It is...
<RobotPinkie> also I think I just turned my mom into a brony, LAWL
<prince-dari> The person who converted me turned their mum into a brony.
<prince-dari> My mum just thinks it looks stupid. XD
<prince-dari> In the first episode, she though the ponies in the intro looked alright, then when it went to Twilight, she said those look stupid/fugly, something along those lines.
<prince-dari> thought*
<RobotPinkie> inb4 server is down again

<Denied_Existence> Ah, I see.
<Wrek> 05so ive been stuck
<Zephirdd> ^_^
<Denied_Existence> I finished that in...oh...like 2 hours.
<Zephirdd> WHAT
<Zephirdd> Its fucking 550 pages long
<Zephirdd> how in the
<Zephirdd> ah nvm
<Denied_Existence> And...?
<DecapKing> i finished it in about that time
<Zephirdd> how can you guys enjoy a story like that D:
<Zephirdd> I can't understand it
<Denied_Existence> I finished 36 chapters of FO:E in like 12 hours
<Zephirdd> .-.
<DecapKing> i read 36 chapters of FO:R in around 6 hours
<Zephirdd> It's impossible for me to read a story without pausing to absorb what I just read
<Denied_Existence> No you didn't DecapKing. You do not qualify for the element of honesty.
<DecapKing> yeah your right
<DecapKing> i could though
<Denied_Existence> Yeah...but you wouldn't actually have read it...just skimmed.
<Denied_Existence> I can read that fast.
<Denied_Existence> My damn SAT score is 2160-2300 and I was reading at a college level when I was in 6th grade!
<DecapKing> http://miburl.com/VDdMvs Have a comic

<Denied_Existence> Yeah...sure....
<Zephirdd> >.>
<Zephirdd> Took me three days to read the 7th HP book
<Zephirdd> which should be about as long as past sins
<Denied_Existence> DecapKing You kill people, therefore your argument is invalid.
<DecapKing> i never read harry potter
<DecapKing> and i dont kill
<DecapKing> i only maim
<Denied_Existence> I read every harry potter book by my self.
<DecapKing> i dont like harry potter
<Denied_Existence> Finished the last one in under 14 hours
<Zephirdd> I think I read Past sins in... 12 hours? I think 10 hours
<Zephirdd> though I read until 18 and then I read 19-21 when it was out
<Zephirdd> so I'm not really sure
<Zephirdd> =p
<Denied_Existence> Good for you Zephirdd

<Ghosties> woo
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> What the hell.
<prince-dari> GGgala, you broke something.
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> Tab fail.
<prince-dari> Ghosties, you must have broken something.*
<GGgala> ...I did?
<GGgala> lulz
<prince-dari> [01:31] <prince-dari> Tab fail.
<Ghosties> I didn't break anything sir
<Octavia> 13:P
<Ghosties> I followed your directions
<GGgala> oh, that kind of tab
<RandomExtra> 0...Wha?
<prince-dari> >works for everyone but Ghosties
<prince-dari> You have to identify for your nick every time you connect
<Ghosties> That's some interesting logic bro
<Ghosties> I did that
<Ghosties> the first time
<prince-dari> MFW all you guys typing out /msg NickServ IDENTIFY password
<prince-dari> When it can really be that short.
<Ghosties> Coincidentally, I never received an email
<Ghosties> Was I supposed to?
<prince-dari> Meh, it's because you're identifying when you're already on the channel.
<prince-dari> Nope.
<Ghosties> WELP
<prince-dari> I have to change a setting in services for you and reboot them.
<prince-dari> :P
*Ghosties has no idea what's wrong
<prince-dari> THANKS A LOT SHOSTIES
<Ghosties> I'M SORRY OKAY
<Pegacorn> gtg guys,seeya tomorow
<Ghosties> I WAS JUST FOLLOWING YOUR ORDER, GAH
<GGgala> later Pegacorn
<prince-dari> >Ghosties not talking in red
<prince-dari> Why?
<prince-dari> IT'S UNNATURAL
<Ghosties> 4Is the script on?
<Ghosties> 4Oh
<prince-dari> It is.
<Ghosties> 4I guess not
<Ghosties> 4...???????
<prince-dari> But your name is an exception.
<prince-dari> Along with all the other mod's names.
<Ghosties> 4Then why am I not being warned
<RandomExtra> 0It wasn't on earlier today actually.
<Ghosties> 4But I'm not ops currently
<prince-dari> It checks if you have either a mod's name, or if you have ops.
<Ghosties> 4so
<prince-dari> If either is true.
<prince-dari> No warning.
<Ghosties> 4oH
<Ghosties> 4Oh
<Ghosties> 4Well
<prince-dari> I thought that'd be the best system.
<prince-dari> Rather than just one or the other.
*Ghosties 4waits for dari to solve Ghosties' problem
*RainBroDash 10is back
*Ohai Shosties
<Ghosties> 4So
<Ghosties> 4Dari
<prince-dari> I can also give the services pony names if people want.
<Ghosties> 4any closer to figuring out what's wrong
<GGgala> ohai Ohai
<prince-dari> Nothing's wrong.
<Ghosties> 4Then
<Ghosties> 4wat do i do
<prince-dari> I just have to change a setting because YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG.
<prince-dari> :P
<FreezeFrame> Eh, NickServ and ChanServ just work better.
<Ghosties> 4I followed your ordedrs t oa tee
<Ghosties> 4*to a tee
<Ghosties> 4*orders
<prince-dari> Ahh, but I didn't say anything about the /ns id command.
<Ghosties> 4The what?
<prince-dari> If I did specify, then you'd be doing it wrong according to my specifications.
<prince-dari> :P
<Ghosties> 4Whatever
<Ghosties> 4Just fix it
<Ghosties> 4Please
<prince-dari> Might as well iron some other things out at the same time.
<prince-dari> How many channels should a single person be allowed to register?
<prince-dari> Default is 20.
<prince-dari> I'd say...5
<GGgala> hey prince-dari, aren't you gonna have the "new EqD post" script running over here?
<prince-dari> I do.
<prince-dari> Well, I started it.
<prince-dari> But no new posts as of yet.
<GGgala> there was one just now...
<prince-dari> Then in 30 seconds it'll appear.
<GGgala> Drawfriend Stuff #175
<prince-dari> That was at 22 minutes in the hour.
<prince-dari> As in, before I started it up here.
<RandomExtra> 0I suppose while we're asking questions, is this going to be the new Standard server/channel thing (not IRC-Savvy) for BMN or just for the S2 airings?
<GGgala> oh
<prince-dari> Standard for everything if it can take the strain of S2.
<prince-dari> Which is what we're testing.
<Dermathil> hehehe
*RBD cheers
<RBD> mfw RBD, not rainbrodash
<RBD> oops
*Shosties 10slaps RBD
<Shosties> 10mfw not rainbrodash still
<Ohai> I've done that a few times today myself.
<FreezeFrame> Are you keeping the concurrent channel limit to the standard 10, dari?
<prince-dari> MFW the standard was 20.
<prince-dari> :P
<prince-dari> I'll probably change it to 10.
<prince-dari> Maybe you're thinking of a different service.
<prince-dari> We're using Anope.
<Dashite> More like Eeeenope.
<prince-dari> :P
<Nittany_Tiger> I haven't registered 10 IRC channels in my entire life. I didn't even know registration limits existed.
<Ohai> I just realized something. If this room has a user cap, then how would one get to the other rooms during the S2 streamings, assuming that not every room is full, seeing as this page just leads to this one?
<Nittany_Tiger> Have a high user cap.
<Ohai> But what if that user cap is filled up?
<Nittany_Tiger> Then new people can't join.
<Nittany_Tiger> Until slots open up.
<RandomExtra> 0But aren't there going to be multiple rooms though?
<Ohai> How would people be able to get to those rooms is my question.
<Nittany_Tiger> Maybe, but they can't communicate between each other.
<Dermathil> Is it possible to make mibbit check if the room is full so it can change like a revolver?
<RandomExtra> 0...Due to not being smart with IRC, I have no idea
<Doku> RandomExtra, can you stop making all of your text off-white?
*Denied_Existence loads his revolver with ServerPiercingRounds.
<RandomExtra> 0Off-white? It looks the same as everyone else's to me.
<Nittany_Tiger> for(i=1; i = # of rooms; i++) {if(usercap = 1) {msg "/join room i}} (pseudocode).
<RandomExtra> 0Sorry if it's actually different.
<Doku> Not on a white background, RandomExtra
<Doku> I can't see it at all unless I highlight it
<Nittany_Tiger> I don't know if a script could be written to do that.
<Denied_Existence> Doku You have a white background...?
<Denied_Existence> AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
<RandomExtra> 0The background's black for me. And besides... Oh now I get what's happening
<Dashite> I know what happened.
<Dashite> RE chose a colour earlier, then went back to white.
<RandomExtra> 0That's what I get for trying to see if the color warning was in effect.
<Dashite> White isn't actually the default colour.
<RandomExtra> 0Well, time to log in then out again.
<Denied_Existence> I can't tell at all.
<Denied_Existence> It looks exactly the same to me...
<Doku> Wait are you ALL using mibbit?
<Denied_Existence> Yesh
<RandomExtra> On second thought, I should've just used Ohai from that point.
<RandomExtra> Well, I am.
<Doku> Oh fuck
<Dashite> I am using mibbit at the moment.
<Doku> Time to get out of here, sorry
<Dashite> I don't generally.
<Denied_Existence> ...........?
<RandomExtra> Wait, what's wrong with mibbit?
*Denied_Existence shoots Doku with a ServerPiercing .44 magnum round!
<Synros> ello
<Dashite> There is nothing wrong with mibbit. I just prefer using a separate client for IRC. More features.
<Dashite> Hey Synros.
<Synros> we got a new IRC?
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm using Chatzilla.
<RandomExtra> Looks like we did.
<Dashite> And I can split my screen between the stream and the chat easier.
<Synros> nice
<GGgala> hey dari, did i miss it or did the script not fire for the EqD post "Ponies Still Wondering: Cello or Double Bass?"
<prince-dari> Oh, it's still posting in the other channel.
<prince-dari> Well I'll fix it later, got other stuff to do at the moment.
<Synros> we need to get some streamin up in hereh!
<Luna> 07sorry i'm a little too busy tonight
<Luna> 07tomorrow House will be up again and the IT Crowd
<Synros> oh well I can wait till House
<Synros> are we starting S3? or on 2 still?
<Ohai> About what time do you think the stream will start tomorrow?
<Dashite> I think we finished season 2.
<Denied_Existence> PONY MATH:
<Denied_Existence> ∆C=(R*c)-ç
<Denied_Existence> ∆C=Total change in coolness
<Denied_Existence> R=Amount of RD's Present
<Denied_Existence> c=Coolness constant (aka 120%)
<GGgala> ohai again Dashite
<GGgala> got rid of Mibbit?
<Dashite> Yup
<Nittany_Tiger> Grad(D)/(eps*mu) + div(v) = I forget.
<GGgala> yay.
<Denied_Existence> and ç=original coolness
<Dashite> Was just checking out how to connect to multiple servers at once.
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm on 4 servers right now for 4 different networks.
<GGgala> ah, good to see you figured it out then
<Nittany_Tiger> And I've done multiple servers for the same network before.
<Nittany_Tiger> It's not hard.
<Ohai> I'm guessing that you can't do it on mibbit?
<Luna> 07please don't do that
<Dashite> No, it isn't. I just hadn't needed to do it before.
<Luna> 07just connect to the mane.irc url
<Ohai> Oh. Ok.
<Nittany_Tiger> There really is no need except during network splits.
<Nittany_Tiger> Which don't last very long.
<Dashite> I've only got one connection to you guys Luna. Connected to a completely different network for something else.
<Luna> 07great, thanks
<RandomExtra> I apologize if I'm being rude or anything Luna, but do you have any idea when you'll start streaming House tomorrow?
<Dermathil> Same time as Always I assume Luna will.
<RandomExtra> Ah. Unfortunately, I have no Idea what that time is.
<Nittany_Tiger> Glad tomorrow's Labor Day. I can watch some House at home.
<Nittany_Tiger> Still have to grade papers, though.
<Nittany_Tiger> Want to see some of the storm pics I took today. Caught a downburst.
<Nittany_Tiger> I really hate the terrain around State College. It kills storms.
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Going to get some Asian food, yum
<Nittany_Tiger> Also, my cat is acting funny.
<Luna> 07funny? in what way?
<Nittany_Tiger> She keeps making low growling noises.
<Luna> 07hmm
<Nittany_Tiger> She did it when the thunderstorm was approaching earlier today.
<Nittany_Tiger> She used to never do that.
<Dashite> No more VioletVanilla?
<FreezeFrame> Tomorrow's Labor Day, so I... have all my classes.
<Luna> 07she be back
<Luna> 07see?
<VioletVanilla> :3 Da magicks~
<Dashite> She was logging in and out with different name. :p
*VioletVanilla ponypounces Dashite
<Dashite> :)
<Dashite> Freezeframe, you have classes tomorrow? O.o
<FreezeFrame> College
<FreezeFrame> College students don't get labor day off :P
<Nittany_Tiger> I do.
<Dashite> Ah...
<RandomExtra> Man... that's unfortunate.
<Nittany_Tiger> If I want to take time off.
<FreezeFrame> I get Columbus Day off, though.
<Dashite> I sorta do. I also have tuesday and wednesday off for some weird reason.
<Nittany_Tiger> US colleges have crappy Fall vacation schedules.
<AllisZero> Columbus day off?
<Dashite> Semester doesn't start until the 8th for some weird reason.
<FreezeFrame> So instead of the holiday to celebrate the advancements caused by organized labor, I get a day off to celebrate someone being a complete idiot.
<AllisZero> I thought that was considered a racist holiday and removed from existence.
<Nittany_Tiger> It's Labor day, 6 weeks of constant classes, then Thanksgiving break.
<Nittany_Tiger> It breaks the will of many (including professors).
<FreezeFrame> I don't mind that much classes in a row
<Nittany_Tiger> Well, you have to factor in HW.
<Dashite> Yes... homework... I totally do that stuff...
<FreezeFrame> Nittany: I loaded up so many classes in my first two years that I'm only going to have to take 12 credits a semester for both my Junior and Sophomore years.
<Dashite> I ended up needing a fifth year. >_>
<Nittany_Tiger> I had to take 15 most of the time.
<FreezeFrame> As well as internships each year (my school requires a 140-hour internship for each year you're there).
<Nittany_Tiger> So did I Dashite.
<Dashite> How many credits do you guys need overall?
<Nittany_Tiger> It wasn't my academic skills that forced me to have to take an extra year. It was credit screw-ups.
<FreezeFrame> For a bachelors, you need 120
<Nittany_Tiger> What's your major?
<FreezeFrame> Mathematics
<Nittany_Tiger> Ooh.
<Nittany_Tiger> One of the "hard" ones.
<Dermathil> OH RIGHT
<Dashite> Ah, we've only got 20 credits for a bachelor.
<Dermathil> Labor Day.
<Dermathil> No classes.
<Dermathil> Forgot 'bout that.
<Dermathil> YAY
<Dermathil> hehehe
<Nittany_Tiger> I almost minored in math.
<FreezeFrame> Next semester I'm taking Geometry, Senior Seminar: Graph Theory, and Physics II
<Dashite> So what is a credit worth in terms of classes? Is it based on a certain number of hours per week or something?
<FreezeFrame> Yup
<FreezeFrame> Most classes are 3 Credit Hours, while lab sciences are 4 (as well as Calculus)
<Dashite> So 1 credit = 1 hour per week right?
<AllisZero> Hahaha RD flooding the Nyaatorrents chatbox
<AllisZero> Makes me a happy man.
<mib_6hsk97> What are we streaming next?
<Dashite> Movies for next week you mean?
<mib_6hsk97> Time until next stream, I mean.
<Dashite> True Romance and Rocky Horror Picture Show.
<VioletVanilla> :3
<mib_6hsk97> Okay. THAnk you
<Dashite> Hmm, I missed when shosties popped up again...
<VioletVanilla> Now ask him which way the talking Llama went~
<Dashite> There was a talking llama?
*Polarfire dusts away the cobwebs
<VioletVanilla> :3
<Dashite> Was it complaining about having it's groove thrown off?
<VioletVanilla> I'm sorry sir, but you've thrown off the Emperor's groove~
<Radiance> What did the cobwebs do to you man?
<Dashite> SOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRrrrrrrrrrrryyyyyyyyy....
<Cookies> you all want to see something amazing?
<VioletVanilla> You? o:
<Dashite> Absolutely not. I've learned to never trust people who say that on the internet.
<VioletVanilla> Because a cookie does sound amazing <3
<Cookies> Cookies are tasty
<Cookies> *giggles*
*Dashite is kinda hungry...
*Dashite eyes cookies...
<Cookies> but what if I would tell you i'm a mod?
*Cookies eyes Dashite up and down
<VioletVanilla> I'm hungry too. . .
<Dashite> OMG it really was Sathi!
<Luna> 07eeeyup
<VioletVanilla> :3
<Dashite> WHOIS doesn't lie...
<VioletVanilla> Yay!
<Dashite> Sathi is spying on us...
<Luna> 07be ware!
<Dashite> You might want to choose a less... edible disguise next time though.
<Luna> 07hehe

<RandomExtra> Was it during that one song (the name of which I can't remember)?
<Ziltoid> hi Denied_Existence
<Sathi> 11Like I said I ran out as soon as possible
<Ziltoid> chatception
<Sathi> 11;)
<Sathi> 11Bai talk to Luna if you need me
<Dermathil> Oi, headache and only 22:31. I guess I should get some rest, especially since I've got tomorrow off due to labor day.
<RandomExtra> Oh. The Swag Spam is pretty normal when that Swagberg song (or it's remixes) plays. That chat is still going too fast for my taste though.
<Dermathil> CYALL tomorrow guys and gals!
<RandomExtra> Bye Dermathil.
<Luna> 07night Dermathil
*Dermathil waves like usual.
<Ziltoid> bye dermathil
*Luna waves back
<Sumica> mode ix?
<AllisZero> Catching up with some nice episodes of Bleach.
<AllisZero> Gotta say the presentation in the anime really isn't what it should be
<Suffuri> anyone from steam on?
<AllisZero> But I guess after 300 episodes, it's all just another episode to them.
<Suffuri> doing my weekend giveaway rightabout now
<Suffuri> err scratch that check the steam bronystate page, post a comment under my thinng
<Suffuri> if you get picked i'll explain shit
<Ziltoid> oh god what is going on
<NewDCD> 9GG hey GG
<NewDCD> 9how goes it
<GGgala> hey DCD
<GGgala> it goes well
<GGgala> you?
<Pinkie_Pie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofK68Cg0bts&feature=related
<NewDCD> 9pretty good on this end
<NewDCD> 9have you gotten the EasyCap yet?
<GGgala> it's on its way.
<Octavia> 13Ooooh, that pisses me off a bit...
<NewDCD> 9awesome
<GGgala> huh
<NewDCD> 9notify me when it's there
<NewDCD> 9in order to train ya
<GGgala> cool.
<GGgala> Octavia: what's pissing you off now?
<Sumica> What happend Octavia ?
<Octavia> 13That bitch who got the voice in The Vinyl Scratch tapes thinks theyre the actual Ocatvia over me...
<Octavia> 13Because they voiced her in that little project.
<GGgala> i almost thought it was my easyCap news based on the timing, lol
<Octavia> 13I'm the names creator.
<Octavia> 13If ANYONE is the real Octavia, its this bitch right here.
<Luna> 07^bitch? you?
<Polarfire> >mfw didn't even notice I have been kickbanned from opers.
<Octavia> 13lol :P
<NewDCD> 9this brings me back to my sociology class of last week
<Ziltoid> Umad octavia?
<Octavia> 13I MAD!
<Luna> 07share the knowledge dcd
<Sumica> So some one makes an audio file and plays a roll in it and clames to be them. Clearly we need to make our own to disprove it.
<NewDCD> 9something about a person's identity
<NewDCD> 9being defined by how society treats them
<NewDCD> 9most of the time, when a "female" identity is imparted into a male subject
<Luna> 07yes?
<NewDCD> 9this will result in more femenine tendencies and to strive to obtain a life partner with a "male" identity
<NewDCD> 9then they gave us an example related to our indigenous population
<GGgala> lol, took me a bit
<GGgala> >mfw i got disconnected and lost all my adminz
<NewDCD> 9one of our Indigenous Tribes over here, the Kunas, have the greatest percentage of male homosexualism, ethnically speaking
<prince-dari> Lolz
<NewDCD> 9this is due to the matriarchal structure of their society
<prince-dari> OH LOOK MAGIC
<prince-dari> whoops.
<NewDCD> 9if the parents never have a female offspring, they tend to raise the youngest male as a "woman", in some ways
<prince-dari> OH LOOK MAGIC THIS TIME
<Octavia> 13I cant believe though this bitch is trying to steal my Octavia from me... and is calling me a fake...
<NewDCD> 9this is due to the fact that women perform vital economic and social tasks in this society
<GGgala> where's "over here" DCD?
<Polarfire> XD
<GGgala> LOL you gave us the censorship mode!
<NewDCD> 9basically they keep their economy afloat, what with they being the only ones allowed to make certain items that tourists love as souveniers
<NewDCD> 9Panama
*GGgala eyes Polarfire
<Sumica> Where is this transpiring Octavia ?
<GGgala> HOW FAMILIAR
<Polarfire> hey, it was an honest mistake.
<prince-dari> XD
<GGgala> did you hear what Da[censored]e said? :P
<Octavia> 13The Brony Show stream chat
<GGgala> something about [censored]ake mushrooms
<Octavia> 13We kept bitching at eachother. ol
<GGgala> worst wordfilter ever
<Polarfire> So what is services root, then dari?
<Octavia> 13I guess since she got to do the voice in one fan made project, she can suddenly steal the Octavia name and all. :P
<Octavia> 13Whats worse is I also auditioned for some parts in it and I didn't get them. So that's probably why I'm a bit upset about someone basically trying to pose as something I almost consider my OC.
<NewDCD> 9so do you
<NewDCD> 9....why can't you be KAMEN OCTAVIAS 1 AND 2?
<NewDCD> 9DOUBLE THE FUN
<NewDCD> 9DOUBLE THE OCTAVIA
<prince-dari> Someone who is on the same connection that services come from.
<Octavia> 13Yeah, but I created the name and some of her early traditions.
<Sumica> Well you are still the first I met so You are the only one in my book.
<Octavia> 13Bleh.
<prince-dari> Allowing them to do...Anything.
<prince-dari> Like RAW commands.
<prince-dari> If you get them wrong, you break the server.
<prince-dari> It's fun.
<GGgala> where does the Octavia self-insert author who wrote the fanfic Black & White fit into this?
<NewDCD> 9Send them this. http://2.p.s.mfcdn.net/store/manga/891/01-001.0/compressed/krspirits_v01c01p046.jpg
<Polarfire> lawl. So you can do prettymuch anything that chanserv, nickserv, etc. can?
<GGgala> are all the servers you, or just rainbow-dash?
<Octavia> 13Not read it. lol
<Polarfire> I think just rainbow dash.
<Polarfire> for right now.
<Polarfire> (I asked earlier)
<GGgala> ah
<prince-dari> Mine is Dash.
<prince-dari> Wrek's is Fluttershy.
<AllisZero> Argh, I feel like I have to create something
<prince-dari> Sathi's gunna have Luna.
<prince-dari> Val, Caramel.
<AllisZero> Instead of just sitting here watching things other people made.
<Polarfire> oh god.
<GGgala> lolwut
<Polarfire> >caramel
<GGgala> Y U NO mane6 first?
<mib_xtg1k4> rainbow dash is stupid
<Dashite> NO U
<prince-dari> Because I decided that as a reward for hosting us a server, and wasting electricity money, people should get to decide which pony their server is named after. :P
<GGgala> oh, you and your /logic/
<mib_xtg1k4> also NewDCD is dum
<prince-dari> Lol
<RainBroDash> 10xD
<Kodiak> Evenin' everypony.
<RainBroDash> 10evenin':)
<Kodiak> How're y'all doing?
<Luna> 07evening

<RainBroDash> 10I'm a bit tired, it's 4am here, so it's bed time for me soon kodiak. How're you doing? :P
<Kodiak> Heh. I'm doing pretty great
<Kodiak> Just listening to some classical pony music
<Luna> 07ohhh I can listen too?

<Luna> 07bah :(
<Kodiak> I think I can find a Youtube link for ya though

<Kodiak> That'll probably put ya to sleep
<Luna> 07oh oh!
<Luna> 07no playlist?
<Luna> 07:(
<Kodiak> I wish I could send it :c
<Kodiak> Actually

<Kodiak> Will do lady ;)
<Kodiak> Everypony's asleep here?
*RainBroDash 10is /falling/ asleep
<Luna> 07afk / away / sleepy
<RainBroDash> 10I need to get my guitar and play some tunes :<
<Ziltoid> DONT GO TO SLEEP
<Kodiak> Actually, I wonder. . .
<Kodiak> Has being a brony changed your life at all?
<Kodiak> Or is it more of a hobby for y'all?
<Dashite> Just one more thing on the pile.
<Nittany_Tiger> Interview?
<RandomExtra> I've been feeling happier on the whole, but otherwise it's a bit more of a hobby.
<Luna> 07Hmm good question
<Luna> 07Actually it has
<Dashite> SirSprinkles is waiting so that he can go "SPRINKLES OUTTA FUKKEN NOWHERE!" after we all forget that he's here.
<Kodiak> Ah
<Nittany_Tiger> My answer: I don't know.
<Kodiak> Kinda the same with me. Just overall greater happiness and appreciation of the friends I have ;)
<prince-dari> It hasn't changed my life.
<Kodiak> Nittany_Tiger: You don't?
<prince-dari> It's just a show I like.
<Dashite> It's made me lose a little bit of sleep, but it's not the first thing to do that to me.
<NewDCD> 9I love being a brony, but live goes on as usual
<NewDCD> 9just that now, I want to meet bronies cause bronies are cool
<NewDCD> 9*life
<Sumica> Depends on how you define life changing.
<Kodiak> NewDCD: Ah
<RandomExtra> Well, I actually have been posting places more (where I'd have just lurked previously) now that I think about it more but otherwise I'd go with the answer I posted a minute ago.
<Nittany_Tiger> Things are quite complex for me emotionally.
<Kodiak> Sumica: As in, your outlook on life
<NewDCD> 9but yeah
<NewDCD> 9being a brony is fun
<Sumica> Ah in that case not really.
<NewDCD> 9but it didn't change me much because I already held many of the core concepts of brony-ism abreast
<NewDCD> 9read: DCD is a Moralfag because Kamen Rider
<NewDCD> 9well
<Sumica> ^ second
<Nittany_Tiger> Lol.
<NewDCD> 9not exactly a MORALfag but I try to play nice yeah
<Nittany_Tiger> Maybe bronyism can help me with my rage issues and introvertedness.
<NewDCD> 9and I always take other people's feelings into account
<Sumica> I still road rage but that's about it as far as my rage goes.
<Kodiak> lol
<NewDCD> 9it also introduced me to true rage, though
<NewDCD> 9because 0r0ch1
<NewDCD> 9he makes me want to go FINAL DANCOUKOGAKEN on his ass
<Nittany_Tiger> I can get easily agitated at things.
<RandomExtra> Who's he?
<Nittany_Tiger> Ex: Losing a lot at games. I used to have that under control years ago.
<Nittany_Tiger> But, again, complications.
<Ziltoid> alright gonna hit the hay goonight
<Sumica> I have learned that my middle finger can drive a seemingly normal human in to a frothing rage. Causing them to have little disregard for there surroundings or passengers.
<RandomExtra> Goodnight Ziltoid
<Sumica> Night Ziltoid
<Nittany_Tiger> I can say that joining this group made me happy at first, but then stress at my paining job destroyed that.
<NewDCD> 9RandomExtra: furfag who tends to draw his fursona fucking the mane cast or Hoity Toity. Also has some serious pedo-vibes, as seen in ways he's draw Applebloom
<NewDCD> 9also yes I said furfag instead of furry, because "furfag" is the only word that fits him like a glove
<Nittany_Tiger> Well, a mantra of tolerance can help me tolerate things that irritate me.
<NewDCD> 9(for the record, I have no problem with furries)
<Octavia> 13>comes in and sees furfag...
<Octavia> 13>knows who DCD is talking about she thinks...
<RandomExtra> Ah.
<Kodiak> NewDCD: It's okay. I take no offense
<Nittany_Tiger> My only deal with many bronies is that many come from chans, while I don't. After seeing the explosive argument at EqD, I started questioning the fandom.
<NewDCD> 9my only real beef is with fursuiters, who could really make something awesome out of those suits, but they look so uncanny valley most of the time
<NewDCD> 9have any of you guys seen the LIONidas "fursuit", so to speak?
<AllisZero> Eh.
<NewDCD> 9I wish more people would try that
<NewDCD> 9that looks fucking amazing
*RainBroDash 10comes back to dari shouting about people liking things he doesn't like
*RainBroDash 10scuttles away speedily
<AllisZero> I position myself in the middle in this discussion.
<prince-dari> Wut?
<Kodiak> Yep.
<RainBroDash> 10alos
<RainBroDash> 10also*
<Sumica> Dari hasnt said a thing till now
<RainBroDash> 10I meant DCD
<prince-dari> I haven't been talking...
<NewDCD> 9here
<prince-dari> O_o
<RainBroDash> 10I can't smart today
<NewDCD> 9more of them should be like this http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4114/4766915170_7e7b86abe6.jpg
<NewDCD> 9nah you know me
<RainBroDash> 10you both start with a d, it's called an epic fail typo
<RainBroDash> 10dealwithit :P
<NewDCD> 9I mention things I don't like but most of the time it's just things that slightly bother me
<NewDCD> 9it's barely any biggie
<SirSprinkles> Dari should totally give me rights and stuff.
<Octavia> 13Hey!
<SirSprinkles> Just saiyan.
<Sumica> interesting but some what disturbing there dcd.
<Octavia> 13Thats Anothrocon!
<Octavia> 13*Anthrocon
<FreezeFrame> dari: is there +N on the ircd you used?
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Octavia> 13I see the Art Show!
<Octavia> 13Dem arts.
<Kodiak> Indeed it is ;)
<Kodiak> And awesome, we have Octavia here
<SirSprinkles> Also, still waiting for it to register the domain... >>;
<Kodiak> Octavia: Play us a song?
<prince-dari> Meh.
<Octavia> 13Uhh, sure. lol
<Octavia> 13I'm paying more attention to The Brony Show chat and stream atm. :P
<Sumica> But if you are talking full costumes I find the official stage show ones far more disterbing the the "fursuit" ones.
<NewDCD> 9I suppose *shrug*
<AllisZero> I have to agree.
<NewDCD> 9I just wish I saw more like this Lionidas
<NewDCD> 9it looks fucking badass as well
<Sumica> Not sure if something like that would work as well with ponies.
<AllisZero> I have a few things that irritate me greatly on both sides of the aisle
<Nittany_Tiger> What is with people against furries? Just an odd group to hate?
<NewDCD> 9never said it'd work for ponies
<NewDCD> 9not really, Nittany
<Octavia> 13I saw the RD and Applejack suits in person. The RD was cool. AJ needs some work.
<NewDCD> 9it's just that there are many people in the furry fandom that give it a bad name
<AllisZero> 1) People who dislike FiM because it's for children and immediately assume you're a pedo for liking it.
<NewDCD> 9as thus, the word "furry" carries a very heavy stigma
<NewDCD> 9it's a heavy load to bear. Not everybody can carry it.
<RainBroDash> 10AllisZero it's odd. More people have made the connection between FiM and being homosexual, than being a paedophile. It's odd
<RainBroDash> 10>it's odd x2
<RainBroDash> 10pfft, I can't type tonight
<SirSprinkles> 6Here's an idea, let them be whoever they want to be. Don't be hating, because everypony has their good points and their bad points.
<RainBroDash> 10ad that recollection was from my experience*
<NewDCD> 9I like to think of it as "The Miserable Fandom", because it doesn't deserve all the hate it gets, albeit one can easily pinpoint the reasons why people hate so much
<AllisZero> RBD, but that's a direct thought on most people's minds I guess.
<Odysseus> All fandoms are frowned upon.
<AllisZero> NewDCD, most things in the world get the rep they have from the extremists, no matter what side you're on
<Odysseus> It doesn't really matter if it's ponies or sports.
<SirSprinkles> 6http://i53.tinypic.com/23lhc42.gif
<Odysseus> Many people laugh at southerners and their football with "Ha ha, what a hick!"
<RandomExtra> I'd agree with DCD. Still though, I do feel bad for the furries with that stigma going around.
<AllisZero> Nobody ever thinks about middle ground when discussing anything unless they're schooled in it
<FreezeFrame> Football is not a hick thing at all, Odysseus
<Sumica> I dont mind furrys so much like all groups it's the extreams of it that gets portrayed the most. Ever see that CSI ep?
<Odysseus> You'd be surprised how some people view it.
<Polarfire> So Dari, since you guys ave your own IRC network now...
<FreezeFrame> Really? I've never seen anyone who views it as a southern thing
<AllisZero> Nascar on the other hand.
<RandomExtra> Really? Football (and other sports) seem to be one of the most respected fandoms (from what I've seen).
<FreezeFrame> Considering that the teams with the most rabid fanbases are all in the North half of the country.
<Odysseus> But I say this sort of thing is probably similar to anime fans.
<Odysseus> Hell, the Japanese think otakus are weird.
<Odysseus> :|
<Sumica> Thought nasscar was viewed as the "hick thing.
<FreezeFrame> (Except Oakland, which isn't really considered "South")
<prince-dari> So?
<Polarfire> What is the mod's stance on channels like Silvershipper that pretty much directly violate the rules by nature?
<Odysseus> Football can be if you look on sports forums. But yeah, probably not the best comparison.
<Nittany_Tiger> I did see that CSI ep with furries.
<AllisZero> The people who take otaku-ism to extremes are weird.
<AllisZero> (This coming from someone who is borderline, mind you)
<prince-dari> As far as I'm concerned those rules are channel rules, not server rules.
<FreezeFrame> Anyone who claims to know sports in one breath and claim (American) football is a southern exclusive is talking out their backside.
<FreezeFrame> It's as simple as that.
<RainBroDash> 10Nittany_Tiger so did I
<Sumica> once again all things have small groups of extreamist giveing the whole a bad name.
<RainBroDash> 10that was.. interesting
<AllisZero> The stigma the japanese have against otaku is based on their portrayal in media though
<NewDCD> 9but yeah
<Polarfire> ah. ok
<FreezeFrame> The biggest fanbases are in Wisconsin, New York, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania
<NewDCD> 9with a lot of people in the fandom like this http://images.encyclopediadramatica.ch/7/75/Chasevrocket-jack.png
<FreezeFrame> And Illinois
<Sumica> 0_o
<NewDCD> 9you just wonder how the hell can the furry fandom have such an unbalanced batshit-crazy-member-to-sane-member ratio
<Odysseus> AllisZero: that can be said for anything.
<FreezeFrame> They don't
<Nittany_Tiger> Wow. That's....
<NewDCD> 9it's the most unfortunate fandom on earth
<NewDCD> 9that's what I consider it
<AllisZero> Odysseus: Anything that's not "socially normal", right?
<FreezeFrame> It's that the batshit-crazy ones are loud and memorable, while the sane ones are very quiet
<NewDCD> 9don't get me started on the users who say they want to fuck cats
<NewDCD> 9just on't
<NewDCD> 9that too
<NewDCD> 9still
<NewDCD> 9it's a bit unbalanced.
<FreezeFrame> And so ashamed of the batshit-crazy ones and the reputation that they won't ever admit to it.
<Odysseus> AllisZero: they want their ratings, and weird things get ratings.
<Odysseus> See HLN
<Nittany_Tiger> That's people who like bestiality.
<AllisZero> I think I have a post here from someone in the furry community about not wanting their children to go to public schools because their teacher said furry creatures didn't exist, or something like that.
<AllisZero> Akin to "my six year old is mature enough to understand Yaoi" I guess huh.
<NewDCD> 9YEAH
<NewDCD> 9*yeah
<FreezeFrame> I can find a million posts from some fundie who doesn't want their child to attend public school because they don't teach that the Earth was created 6,000 years ago by God in 7 days
<NewDCD> 9I feel sorry for the sane fans
<Sumica> this would be a great place to live if it wasn't for all the people.
<FreezeFrame> Doesn't matter what fandom, there's always some embarassing fuckwit spoiling it for the rest of us.
<Polarfire> >_>
<Sumica> so is it bad that i find it funny we just called religion a fandom =p
<NewDCD> 9yeah
<NewDCD> 9luckily
<NewDCD> 9bronies don't have much in the term of fuckwits
<FreezeFrame> Sumica: Yes, it's bad, but I'm actually pretty religious, and I'm the one who made the joke.
<NewDCD> 9 0r0ch1 is the closest I've seen
<NewDCD> 9but that's relatively mild
<Nittany_Tiger> Religions suffer from extremism as well.
<FreezeFrame> Just people who keep trying to force it down others' throats.
<Polarfire> mai waifu and my bro whom I also love in a platonic way are in the same channel. <3
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm a quite tolerant Christian myself.
<NewDCD> 9yeah
<NewDCD> 9I hate that
<Sumica> Oh i know they do Nittany_Tiger they are the oldist fandom. ^_^
<Nittany_Tiger> Actually, there are older religions.
<Sumica> which is probably whey they are the most extreme.
<Octavia> 13Theyre doing live interviews on The Brony Show right now. I kinda want to do live interviews now. <3
<FreezeFrame> I think Sumica meant religion in general
<Nittany_Tiger> It's only the most outspoken ones that define us.
<FreezeFrame> The oldest religion in general practice, I believe, is Judaism
<FreezeFrame> Though the various Native American religions may be as old or older.
<AllisZero> Scientology!
<Sumica> yeah I was't singaling out any one religion.
<Nittany_Tiger> There's older ones. Zorastraism (sp?) for example. It may be still in practice.
<FreezeFrame> Zoroastrianism is still in continuous practice
<Sumica> every time Scientology come up I want to link this one video.
<prince-dari> Heheh.
<NewDCD> 9BronyState: Home of Intellectual Discussions between bronies
<FreezeFrame> (The reason I was discounting Norse and Kemetic was that they fell out for a long enough time that there were actually zero adherents for multiple generations, though some are going back to the "old ways" as they call them.
<AllisZero> I just threw out the most ridiculous thing I could think of so I wouldn't be counted out of the conversation.
<FreezeFrame> I actually have a couple of friends who are followers of ancient polytheistic religions.
*RainBroDash 10doesn't like to discuss religion
<RainBroDash> 10:<
*Octavia 13doesnt like to either ;)
<RainBroDash> 10;D
<Nittany_Tiger> It can lead to explosive conversations.
*AllisZero agrees.
<Sumica> damn my self defense mechanism to discussions like this, i keep wanting to crack jokes.
<FreezeFrame> I don't mind it as long as it remains civil
<Nittany_Tiger> On the forum I moderate on, it often does lead to heated debates.
<FreezeFrame> And jokes are actually funny.
<FreezeFrame> Like the one about variations of the Lord's Prayer
<RainBroDash> 10yeah NT, and a lot of people tend to disagree with me
<Sumica> Well forexample i read that as Ponytheistic for a second.
<RainBroDash> 10so I tend to stay quiet
<Nittany_Tiger> Well, we have our "extremists"
<Sumica> also video. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF5fIHhsHeM
<FreezeFrame> Sumica: That would be the time to slowly back away.
<Nittany_Tiger> One hardcore atheist became offended when I called him an extremist.
<FreezeFrame> Because he associated the term with religiously faithful extremists
<Nittany_Tiger> We've had true extremists before.
<FreezeFrame> Like full on "kill the infidels, bomb abortion clinics" types?
<Nittany_Tiger> We had an Jewish extremist apparently from Israel.
<Nittany_Tiger> He's perma-banned from the forums now, though.
<AllisZero> Isn't it alike though? Can't you think a lot of atheists actually behave like it's their religion?
<prince-dari> Oh God.
<FreezeFrame> I'd consider it a religious viewpoint, at minimum
<prince-dari> We're on to religion?
<FreezeFrame> And it's perfectly civil.
<RandomExtra> Yes.
<Nittany_Tiger> Atheism is fun because in some ways, it is a religion.
<Nittany_Tiger> It at least has its extremists.
<Nittany_Tiger> Which surprised me at first.
<NewDCD> 9we are, Dari
<AllisZero> They complain about organized religion but some are very fast to try and shove down their views down everyone's throats, the same thing they accuse religions of trying to do.
<NewDCD> 9but we're being Civil
<NewDCD> 9so fret not
<NewDCD> 9no tables to be flipped here
<Nittany_Tiger> Exactly AllisZero.
<Sumica> How dare you call me civil.
<prince-dari> >no tables are flipped here
<prince-dari> Oh dear.
*Sumica looks for a table
<prince-dari> I get the feeling you shouldn't have said that.
<FreezeFrame> I thought it was a funny reference
<Nittany_Tiger> Some don't want to shield their kids from religion.
<Nittany_Tiger> Some want religious symbols gone from our govt.
<Nittany_Tiger> It's just stupid.
<FreezeFrame> I actually agree with the latter of those two.

<Octavia> 13....
<NewDCD> 9KEIKAKU DOORI
<Octavia> 13>comes back in for a moment
<Octavia> 13>tons of tables flipped...
<NewDCD> 9TL NOTE: KEIKAKU MEANS PLAN
<AllisZero> Keikaku taboru?
<Octavia> 13DARNIT RBD!
<RainBroDash> 10XD
<NewDCD> 9TL NOTE: DOORI MEANS "JUST AS"
<Nittany_Tiger> Mr. Dash, why so many tables?
<RainBroDash> 10NT
<Sumica> welcome back Octavia, oh guesswhat some guy used funny math to prove you play a double bass.
<RainBroDash> 10because table
<Nittany_Tiger> Makes sense.
<Octavia> 13I saw it on EqD and commented. lol
<Octavia> 13I'm sticking to cello still :P
<Octavia> 13Dem fancy mathematics dont prove anything. :P
<Octavia> 13Muddying up the issue~
<Octavia> 13XD
<Sumica> Yeah I was reading thought it but then this chat got interesting.
<Sumica> eeyup
*RainBroDash 10would prefer it to be a bassello
<RainBroDash> 10SPEAKING OF WHICH
<FreezeFrame> Thread derail was good!
<Sumica> now that sounds like an interesting instrument
<Dashite> It's still totally a Cello
<RainBroDash> 10allegrezza has a new updae
*AllisZero facepalms.
<AllisZero> People will argue over anything.
<Dashite> What? Where?!
<AllisZero> IT'S A DOUBLE BASS
<Dashite> CELLO!
<Sumica> Should I have done the AAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaa thing?
<AllisZero> NO YOU ASSFACE DOUBLE-CLOWN, IT'S A CELLO
<FreezeFrame> I finally installed the GreaseMonkey script
<NewDCD> 9IT'S NEITHER.
<NewDCD> 9it's obviously a pony-exclusive instrument
<RainBroDash> 10IT IS A BASSELLO
<RainBroDash> 10DEALWITHIT （╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
<NewDCD> 9that might or might not be an equivalent to one of these instruments
<Sumica> Bassxello?
*NewDCD 9solved the puzzle!
<Dashite> NO U RBD. It's totally a cello.
<Dashite> Just look at it!
<FreezeFrame> BronyState: The only place where discussions about a fictional character's instrument are more heated than discussions about religon.
<AllisZero> Octavia plays a violin is now canon.
<Octavia> 13I heard that one already DCD lol
<RainBroDash> 10because discussing religion is pointless :P
<AllisZero> Just a very large violin.
<Sumica> damn you FreezeFrame I almost choked on my drink there.
<Nittany_Tiger> It's a string instrument!
*Octavia 13plays a cello and violin irl
<Kodiak> I though Octavia was on the cello
<Octavia> 13Honestly.
<Octavia> 13To be honest.
*RainBroDash 10plays the guitar. RainBroDash is currently -playing- the guitar
<Octavia> 13It was just meant to be close to this or that instrument.
<Sumica> watch this Kodiak
<Sumica> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=st9CxveZieg
*AllisZero can't play an instrument; dropped out of guitar classes.
<Octavia> 13It wasn't really thought through quite so much it HAD to be one specific instrument.
<Octavia> 13Just look similar to one.
<Kodiak> Ha, there's a video on it?
<Sumica> eeyup
<Octavia> 13Yeah, someone tried to explain it and failed. lol
<Octavia> 13Its the same stuff I've heard a million times over.
<Octavia> 13I've heard both sides of the argument and they both have valid points
<Sumica> noncence he perfectly changed the valuse so they prove his point.
<Octavia> 13But the fact of the matter is, it wasn't meant to be a particular stringed instrument. Just look similiar to one.
<AllisZero> Alright almost 12 Am, I'm gonna finish up this episode of It Crowd and go to bed.
<Kodiak> How's this: Hooves can't hold a bow easily. Argument is now invalid.
<AllisZero> Night everypony
<Kodiak> AllisZero: Sleep well
<Octavia> 13Even Jayson said it was a cello, but he didn't really think of it that much.
<Sumica> but then we have to look at it as just a show then Octavia
<RainBroDash> 10night alliszero
<RandomExtra> Goodnight AllisZero
<Octavia> 13Night AllisZero
<Sumica> night AllisZero
<Dashite> WOG says Cello, I'm right! Aw yeah!
<Octavia> 13It honestly wasn't considered when they put it in there.
<FreezeFrame> Sumica: That voice
<Octavia> 13It just had to simply -look- like a certain instrument.
<FreezeFrame> I wish I had that voice
<Dashite> Love the end.
<Sumica> it is kinda smooth is't it.
<Octavia> 13Is Sumica streaming right now?
<FreezeFrame> Mine is lispy
<Sumica> Good voice for radio.
<FreezeFrame> My gf thinks it's sexy, but I'm pretty sure she's biased.
<Sumica> no, should I be?
<Octavia> 13No. lol Someone commented on your voice though and I was like... what? XD
<Polarfire> one of whom it appears is missing...
<Dashite> Her cutie mark is a Treble Clef, which is most commonly﻿ played by the Violin, and very rarely played by the Cello or Double Bass.
<Dashite> Therefor, she is actually playing a 6 foot tall violin.
<Dashite> Issue solved.
<FreezeFrame> I wasn't comenting on Sumica's
<Sumica> the voice on the celloxdouble bass video.
<FreezeFrame> The video he linked.
<Octavia> 13Thats one supporting fact too Dashite
<Octavia> 13As to why its a cello
<Octavia> 13Ah, okay FreezeFrame
<FreezeFrame> Actually, of the four orchestral string instruments, the only instrument that is played on the treble clef is the violin
<RainBroDash> 10http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RYq-KiKjrM
<Sumica> But yeah my voice is't that great, kind of a Ben stine voice here.
<FreezeFrame> The viola is played on the tenor clef, which is a C clef, placing middle C in the center of the staff, while doublebass and violincello are played on the bass clef
<Dashite> 6 foot violin 1, double bass/cello 0
*RainBroDash 10can't read music well because he's a lousy musician
<Denied_Existence> Octavia, Mark managed to fix the stream.
<RainBroDash> 10also I vote for the 6 foot violin
<Octavia> 13I see now.
<Denied_Existence> They are back up on livestream
<Dashite> I'm with you RainBro.
<Octavia> 13Cello still here. ;)
<prince-dari> ^ Oh dear
<Octavia> 13lol
<Dashite> Finally!
<Dashite> Finally we get a take on Faust!
<RandomExtra> Sounds interesting.
<Kodiak> prince-dari: Link?
<FreezeFrame> Octavia's special talent could be playing all stringed instruments
<FreezeFrame> In S2, we get a scene of her playing a beautiful Spanish guitar piece.
<Dashite> In season 2 we discover that Octavia moonlights as lead guitar in a rock band.
<FreezeFrame> That'd be funny, but nah
<Sumica> woh, 75min of pony bloopers?
<Octavia> 13Ugh XD
<Octavia> 13And yes
<Octavia> 13They discovered some of the flaws, oh no!
<Dashite> And damn you RainBroDash!
<Dashite> You made me think that part four of Allegrezza was out.
<Ghosties> 4Red
<Dashite> White
<Kodiak> Octavia needs to get down on some country fiddle.
<Kodiak> That'd I love to see
<FreezeFrame> Something like this being played by Octavia: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0rGTYQBq0U&feature=related
<Dashite> Banjo
<Ghosties> 4RED'S BETTER, DASHITE
<Ghosties> 4>: I
<Dashite> BETTER DEAD THAN RED!
<Dashite> NO WAIT!
<Dashite> I take it back!
<Ghosties> 4NAH
<Ghosties> 4You're thinking communist mentality. I'm thinking RED DEAD mentality
<Dashite> >_>
*Dashite stays quiet
<RainBroDash> 10dashite, shit my bad
<RainBroDash> 10I've only just seen that part 3 is out ;3
<RainBroDash> 10but yeah, I liked it xD
<Dashite> Can't wait for more. :D
<FreezeFrame> I'm trying to read fewer incomplete fics
<FreezeFrame> After having a couple that were completely abandoned
<Dashite> I hate it when that happens. :(
<Sumica> I am disapoint I thought it was somthing offisia not oh look what I caught after watching the show 500times.
<Kodiak> I'm off to bed. Good night everypony!
<SirSprinkles> 6SPRINKLES OUTTA FUKKEN NOWHERE
<Ghosties> 4:O
<Kodiak> ?
<Dashite> I knew it.
<SirSprinkles> 6G'night Kodiak
<Sumica> you so called it an hour ago
<Dashite> :D
<Ghosties> 4We have a purple spy in Brony State. I repeat, we have a purple spy in Brony State
<SirSprinkles> 6Except I posted after he said that, Sumica.
<SirSprinkles> 6So it canceled it out.
<FreezeFrame> Spycheck!
*FreezeFrame turns on flamethrower
<Dashite> You did exactly what I said you'd do!
<SirSprinkles> 6NOPONY EXPECTS PRP TEAM!
<Dashite> That's only cause I have no idea who or what PRP team is. :/
<SirSprinkles> 6And you never will.
<Sumica> Will have to take your word on it. Mibbit dosent have much of a backlog.
<SirSprinkles> 6Because you'll be dead.
<Ghosties> 4BETTER RED
<FreezeFrame> Okay, time for me to sleep, since my alarm is set for 6 AM on weekdays.
<Ghosties> 4THAN DEAD
<Ghosties> 4Goodnight, FreezeFrame
<Dashite> That's okay Sumica, I'm not using Mibbit. Hurray for infinite chat length!
<Dashite> [23:10] <Dashite> SirSprinkles is waiting so that he can go "SPRINKLES OUTTA FUKKEN NOWHERE!" after we all forget that he's here.
<Dashite> :p
<Dashite> And then it got quiet...
<Luna> 07THIS IS YOUR LUNA WAKE UP CALL!
*RainBroDash 10is exploding from nostalgia
<Sumica> *gasp*
<SirSprinkles> 6SPRINKLES OUTTA FUKKEN NOWHERE!
<Nittany_Tiger> Hi.
*RainBroDash 10can't ta;l
<Nittany_Tiger> Eh eh eh.
<RainBroDash> 10talk*
<Luna> 07I knew it!
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm the only one that can explode.
<Sumica> but can you do it twice?
<Luna> 07For SCIENCE!
<Nittany_Tiger> I can explode an infinite number of times if needed.
<Sumica> Woo some one else that yells for science before doing somthing silly.
<Dashite> Doesn't everybody?
<Sumica> I knew of only one other person.
<Sumica> And I got him to jump off of Daleran cause i shouted for science.
<Luna> 07Dalaran?
<Luna> 07:o
<Sumica> Eh yeah the correct spelling of it.
<Luna> 07Dat brings back memories...
<Sumica> Wanted to check and see if jumper cables shared a cooldown with the armyknife.
<Luna> 07hahaha
<Polarfire> >_>
<Sumica> You know the more of this blooper thing I watch the more I wonder how the hell did they even notice that at all.
<RainBroDash> 10some people have crazy hobbies :P
<Denied_Existence> *Yawn*
<Sumica> I think so far I only caught one of them and that was the black ink on dahses eye swaping from left eye to right eye between shots.
<Polarfire> Dari?
<prince-dari> Hm?
<Polarfire> What kind of foods do you like :D
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<Polarfire> Hmm...
<prince-dari> Well I like salad quite a lot (salad olivieh is best salad), I like fish (cooked :P), I like rice (not the bland boring kind, tasty saffron rice).
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<Polarfire> yes, yes....
<SirSprinkles> 6NOWHERE OUTTA FUKKEN SPRINKLES!
<Polarfire> this? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salad_Olivier
<Dashite> FUKKEN SPRINKLES OUTTA NOWHERE!
<prince-dari> Doesn't really look right.
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<prince-dari> Well not the way I'm used having it.
<Polarfire> That's a lot different from the salads I'm used to.
<prince-dari> Looks bit more like this when I have it: http://oysterfoodandculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/394560311_b2890fa692-300x252.jpg
<prince-dari> Well no, most salads I have aren't like that.
<Polarfire> NOWHERE SPRINKLES FUKKEN OUTTA!
<prince-dari> But that's probably my favourite.
<prince-dari> :P
<Polarfire> ah.
<Luna> 07amhg

<Luna> 07lol
<Polarfire> Good, now I have something to make for you :D
<prince-dari> Hahaha,
<SirSprinkles> 6Come on guys, there's a total of 24 possible combinations of those words... work harder.
<Polarfire> I like fish... I try to eat lots of fruit and veggies to stay healthy... and potatoes are good :D and I like pasta. And chocolate milk. And soda. And caffeine... >_> which leads into coffee....
<Dashite> I'm good with my contribution.
<Polarfire> My list is getting progressively unhealthy...
<Polarfire> Ask the 22 other people in chat :P
<Sumica> cant hear you, im asleep.
<prince-dari> >put chocolate milk in coffee
<prince-dari> >Win life
<prince-dari> :P
<Polarfire> Have you tried it?
<prince-dari> Nope.
<Polarfire> damn that was fast.

<prince-dari> Nope.
<Polarfire> magic... So which services package did you guys end up using?
<prince-dari> I broke it.
<Dashite> <censored> <censored> <censored> <censored> <censored> <censored> <censored> <censored> <censored> <censored> <censored> <censored> <censored> <censored> <censored> <censored> <censored> <censored> <censored> <censored> <censored> <censored> <censored> <censored> <censored> <censored> <censored> <censored> <censored> <censored> <censored> <censored> <censored> <censored> <censored> <censored> <censored> <censored> <censored> <censored> <cens
<prince-dari> Everythings broken.
<prince-dari> Everything's*
<prince-dari> Anope
<Polarfire> Hey Radiance
<Sumica> did I miss somthing?
<Dashite> Maybe?
<Polarfire> That's the one I'm getting :D And once you install those, you can be services root? (and do anything)
*I_Have_No_Balls 10is back
<Polarfire> wb
<I_Have_No_Balls> 10with less balls than ever
<Polarfire> that was fast
<Polarfire> lawl.
<prince-dari> Eeyup.
<Polarfire> So what is the difference between Services root and net admin?
<prince-dari> Net Admin can't use some commands. :P
<prince-dari> Like svsnick
<Radiance> Hi Polar
<Sumica> I sence a kick coming.
<Polarfire> oh. So what are RAW commands then? (in reference to what you said about breaking the server)
<Polarfire> ohai
<Polarfire> What are you here for?
<Polarfire> you know this room is now decrepit correct?
<prince-dari> It means it ignores aliases and all the stuff your client does to simplify stuff.
<prince-dari> Whenever you type in a channel, what your client actually sends to the server is
<prince-dari> PRIVMSG #chan :Message here
<Polarfire> XD
<prince-dari> ^that's the RAW command
<prince-dari> As opposed to what your client does,
<Polarfire> oh. So basically raw commands are the server's language. And the client just frills things up and does that stuff for you automatically.
<Polarfire> this is my message
<Polarfire> this is my message
<Polarfire> hmm... PRIVMSG doesn't work...
<prince-dari> Well it does on mIRC.
<prince-dari> Because the guy who made it added that in.
<prince-dari> Just you can't see messages you post.
<prince-dari> Because of the way clients work.
<Polarfire> This is my message.
<prince-dari> [06:17] <Polarfire> this is my message
<prince-dari> [06:19] <Polarfire> this is my message
<Polarfire> oh. /msg works
<Polarfire> aaaah.
<prince-dari> You just can't see it.
<Polarfire> :O
<Polarfire> so much magic for my brain
<prince-dari> Because when you talk, it adds the message directly to the chat window.
<prince-dari> Where as when you use privmsg it sends the message just to the server.
<prince-dari> So everyone else sees it.
<prince-dari> Not you.
<Polarfire> Which you got because you are the server?
<Polarfire> oh.
<Polarfire> interesting.
<Polarfire> I feel bad.
<Polarfire> Since I'm bumming knowledge off of you.
<Polarfire> Sumica never came back.
<prince-dari> What?
<prince-dari> You feel bad why?
<prince-dari> I don't understand.
<prince-dari> I don't want you to feel bad. :(
<Polarfire> I'm bumming knowlege off of you. Asking you a bunch of more than likely annoying questions.
<Polarfire> Instead of questing for my own knowledge on the internet.
*Luna is yawning sleepy
<prince-dari> Lulz
<Luna> 07hahahaha
<Luna> 07trollin :P
<prince-dari> Eeyup.
<Radiance> Oh is it? Where did it move to. I just keep this loaded in my mIRC
<prince-dari> Nah, don't worry about it.
<prince-dari> It's fine.
<Polarfire> Thanks.
<Polarfire> for your help
<prince-dari> irc.bronyserv.co.cc
<SirSprinkles> 6SOFN!
<prince-dari> No problem. <3
<Polarfire> :D
<Spyrorocks`> Aristeo, i think apache is killing itself again
<Polarfire> I have the best waifu.
<Sumica> kinda wish i had time stamps to know how long that took.
<Luna> 07get irc ;)
<Luna> 07mirc
<Luna> 07[07:38] <Sumica> kinda wish i had time stamps to know how long that took.

<Luna> 07[07:38] <@Luna> mirc
<Sumica> Have it just need to install it....and learn how to use it to get back here.
<Luna> 07I can help with that

<Luna> 07night Nittany_Tiger
<Luna> 07sweet dreams
<Nittany_Tiger> Night Luna.
<Nittany_Tiger> Thanks.
<Polarfire> So how can chanserv be op'ing mods without being there in the room?
<Polarfire> Or is that your magic again...
<prince-dari> Because all it's doing is setting a channel mode.
<prince-dari> I don't have to be in a channel to set a channel mode.
<prince-dari> :P
<Polarfire> oh duh.
<Polarfire> I was just mixed up since chanserv was in the old bronystate.
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Sumica> ok guess it works.
<Polarfire> yep.
<Polarfire> Down with mibbit!
<Sumica> Kinda like the black background though =p
<Polarfire> eh. you get un-accustomed to it.
<Polarfire> and I think there is a way to change the background.
<Polarfire> at least there is in my client.
<Sumica> yeah was looking at the colors thingies.
<Sumica> well got the main windo back to white on black.
<Sumica> there we go.
<prince-dari> Eugh, black background.
<prince-dari> :P
<Sumica> Not a fan of bright white text fields.
<Sumica> Besides i wouldt get to see your gray box with Blue text if I had the white background.
<Luna> 07welcome back :)
<Sumica> oki so trying to use that whois seems to have pissed it off.
<Polarfire> eh?
<Luna> 07works fine here
<Polarfire> you used /whois <nick> ?
<Polarfire> Do you use your computer for the bronystate website server also?
<prince-dari> MFW that image.
<prince-dari> I like it.
*prince-dari actually touched his screen. XD
<Sumica> I use the rightclick on the names in the right bar.
<Sumica> next thing I know I was disco and auto reconnecting.
<Polarfire> Just curious dari
<Polarfire> how did you find that?
<prince-dari> Searching for a particular package on a forum.
<prince-dari> Guy had it in his sig.
<Polarfire> ah.
<Sunil_Yohannan> Hey, how's it goin?
<Sumica> Did't even do any thing that time.
<prince-dari> [07:29] * Sumica (Sumica@brony-7C4A430.dhcp.embarqhsd.net) Quit (Connection reset by peer)
<prince-dari> Nope.
<prince-dari> I decided that'd probably not be a good idea.
<prince-dari> I hosted it briefly to show a couple mods though.
<prince-dari> Show them what I was doing with it.
<Sumica> ok, so what dose that meen?
<prince-dari> To google. :P
<prince-dari> I think it's a pretty general quit message.
<Polarfire> oh. So you've got the website with a hosting company then?
<prince-dari> Can mean a lot of things.
<Sumica> Seems it's just mirc derping
<Polarfire> you poor, poor mibbitfoals.
<prince-dari> If it's happpening a lot to you then it's a problem specific to you, not mIRC.
<prince-dari> :P
<Sumica> Doubt that as it worked fine thought the web version =p
<Polarfire> Actually I'd probably still be using mibbit if it weren't for one thing.
<Polarfire> (well, multiple things now, but only one thing at the time)
<prince-dari> >We version
<prince-dari> Web*
<prince-dari> IE not software.
<Sumica> My bet is system is pissy cause i havent restarted in a few days.
<Polarfire> linux has more win than all of your silly windows :P
<Luna> 07Software caused connection abort interesting
<Sumica> Do what now?
<Polarfire> * Sumica has quit (Software caused connection abort)
<Polarfire> * Sumica (Sumica@brony-7C4A430.dhcp.embarqhsd.net) has joined #BronyState
<Polarfire> hey dari

<prince-dari> :P
<Polarfire> heh.
<prince-dari> A free one.
<Polarfire> nice ;)
<Polarfire> Alright question
<Polarfire> What CPU do you have?
<prince-dari> As in just size, or make and type?
<Polarfire> just general specs... intel, amd, speed, cores...
<prince-dari> Intel Pentium D CPU 2.8 GHz.
<Polarfire> ah.
<prince-dari> So dual
<Polarfire> yeah.
<Polarfire> so it runs the IRCd ok?
<prince-dari> IRCd take next to no resources.
<Polarfire> even under strain/heavy use?
<prince-dari> Physical, or network.
<prince-dari> Nope.
<prince-dari> Still under heavy use next to nothing.
<prince-dari> Problem is internet reliability.
<Polarfire> huh. Even with 4000 users?
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Sumica> oki just gonna restart everything.
<prince-dari> Though the thing is unreliable internet could mean the servers desync.
<prince-dari> And shit gets screwed up.
<Polarfire> oh. bad.
<prince-dari> We'll probably switch networks before S2.
<prince-dari> For reliability.
<Polarfire> I've got my unreal running on an old desktop someone gave me. Its got a 2.5 ghz celeron and I noticed it used practically nothing. Of course I have no way to test it under strain right now... so I was just wondering.
<Polarfire> And switch networks? you mean switch away from your own?
<Octavia> 13Whew, spent a loooooooong time listening to The Brony Show stream and chatting lol
<Radiance> Thanks for redirecting me to bronyserv, dari
<prince-dari> Eeyup.
<Polarfire> I saw that.
<Polarfire> oh D:
<prince-dari> No problem.
<Radiance> How are things in here?
<Polarfire> so switch..... back to epic-chat? :P
<prince-dari> Traitor!
<prince-dari> :P
<Octavia> 13Quiet. lol
<Octavia> 13lol
<Polarfire> HEY HEY
<prince-dari> You didn't miss much anyway.
<prince-dari> Nope.
<Octavia> 13I thouhgt they knew about us... but when I mentioned BronyState they were like "wut?"
<Polarfire> NO ADVERTISING OUTSIDE STREAMS/CHATS!!
<Polarfire> to something bigger?
<prince-dari> They do.
<prince-dari> They put in a word for us most of their shows.
<Octavia> 13We need to kick our plots in gear, they all seem to be connected and forget about us :P
<prince-dari> To something specifically for bronies.
<Octavia> 13Its weird then.
<Polarfire> ah.... so.... Is there a reliable IRC network for bronies out there? XD
<Octavia> 13Maybe just Shamrock and the ones around the computer at the time didnt know of BronyState then.
<Polarfire> And won't having 4 servers be pretty reliable? :P
*Polarfire dusts away the cobwebs
<SirSprinkles> 6I need to talk to Circuit Mane again about getting a mod on the show... preferably next week.
<Polarfire> SOFN!!!
<Polarfire> wb
<Sumica> Thanks
<Polarfire> :3
*Sumica starts a timer
<Sumica> ...ok the song from this game is disterbing http://ponyvspony.artix.com/
<Polarfire> yes
<Polarfire> yes it is
<Octavia> 13You mean their show Sprinkles?
<prince-dari> There's about to be.
<Octavia> 13Pony Vs Pony, I was playing it last night.
<Polarfire> :O
<Octavia> 13For about an hour, then I went back to WoW. lol
<Polarfire> are you guys going to make it? >_>
<prince-dari> Nope.
<Octavia> 13And darnit! Ponies invade my mind. This morning I had oatmeal for breakfast. And just instantly I go "Oatmeal? Are you crazy?!"
<Polarfire> oh.
<Polarfire> So is this news supposed to be out there yet?
<prince-dari> Nope.
<Polarfire> oh. Can I know who's behind it? >_>
*Polarfire leans in close
<Polarfire> <_<
<prince-dari> Odysseus and his friend.
<Polarfire> heh.
<prince-dari> Buying commercial servers/shells.
<Polarfire> :O
<Polarfire> dunno who that is... I see they are in chat.
<Polarfire> and wow.... going commercial.
*Sumica starts kicking things
*Polarfire joins Sumica kicking things
<Octavia> 13o.o
*Octavia 13watched Sumica and Polarfire kick things
<Polarfire> o_O
<Sumica> mIRC likes to randomy drop me and is't telling me why.
<Octavia> 13Ick
<Sumica> ofcorse for all i know Dari could just be trolling me.
<prince-dari> Trololo
<Polarfire> uh-oh
<Polarfire> can you do that dari?
<prince-dari> I can, but it wouldn't give that quit message.
<prince-dari> I dunno why your computer hates mIRC so much.
<Octavia> 13lol
<Polarfire> get Xchat. it's full of win.
<Sumica> perhaps they just need to get to know eachother. or i have to go in to my router and play around with it.
<prince-dari> Pfft, xchat.
<prince-dari> :P
<Octavia> 13I have over 2 dozen custom ponys on Ebay saved in my bookmarks...
<Polarfire> you can get plugins for any language you want besides mIRC :P
<Polarfire> *scripting language
<prince-dari> >no mirc
<prince-dari> >complete and utter fail
<Sumica> Why is that Octavia, planing on buying them?
<Polarfire> eh works fein for me.....
<Polarfire> lots of handy buttons and such.
<Polarfire> Of course your fingers move with a vengeance so you don't need those buttons.
<Sumica> .....why can I not connect to my routers page.
<Octavia> 13I'm keeping an eye on them, yes Sumica :P
<Polarfire> Of course the plugins would be handy if I actually knew how to program.
<Polarfire> 12b02u06t 13I 15d14i05d 04s07t08e09a03l 11o10n12e 02s06c13r15i14p05t 04f07r08o09m 03t11h10e 12i02n06t13e15r14n05e04t07.

<Polarfire> >_>
<Octavia> 13Haha
<Octavia> 13Threesome?
*Polarfire runs to Dari
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<Sumica> oh dear look at the time I think I hear my mirc crashing.
<prince-dari> This is an interesting proposition.
<Octavia> 13<3
<prince-dari> :>
<Polarfire> oh lawd
<Octavia> 13You can't deny the sexy Octavia
<Polarfire> don't make me get on one of my costumes
<prince-dari> LOL
<prince-dari> I remember the last time that happened.
<Octavia> 13Oh no XD
<Polarfire> I remember both times that happened.
<prince-dari> :P
<prince-dari> Poor stripes.
<prince-dari> :P
<Polarfire> Speaking of which I have some unfinished business with Dari. <3
<Octavia> 13Sounds hawt
<prince-dari> Heheheh. <3
*Octavia 13gets camera
<Polarfire> hmm. That's just what Striped did.
<Octavia> 13Dont mind me. Just photographing the... uh... birds! Yes, thats it.

<Octavia> 13I like birds, >.>;
<Sumica> not sure if wants to know.

<Polarfire> v.v
<Polarfire> ok then...
<prince-dari> Then we can... ;) <3333333333333333333
<Polarfire> Still working on the IRC?
<prince-dari> I love you. <3
<Polarfire> and yay!
<Polarfire> I love you too. <3
<prince-dari> Nope, back to trying to fix BSoDs.
<SirSprinkles> 6Oh yeah... photograph those birds...
<Octavia> 13Those are some nasty nasty birds... uhhh...
<SirSprinkles> 6...XD
<Polarfire> >_>
<Octavia> 13lol
<Octavia> 13<3
<Polarfire> Hey Octavia
<Polarfire> How goes things?
<Polarfire> Also, interesting thing.
<Polarfire> Not sure if he wants it getting out... but Octavia lives about 30 minutes from me :P
<prince-dari> No way
<prince-dari> :OOOOOOO
<Polarfire> yep.
<prince-dari> I'm jelly
<prince-dari> ;___;
<Polarfire> jelly of what?
<Polarfire> doesn't RBD live close to you?
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<prince-dari> But I'm jelly that Octavia lives that close to YOU.
<Polarfire> awww <3333333
<Polarfire> If Dari lived 30 minutes away from me I would bust my door down trying to get out to my car.
<prince-dari> >paypal to Octavia, make her buy you lunch
<prince-dari> :D
<prince-dari> Mwuahahahaha
<Octavia> 13Ehh, tired. 2:30am here and kinda tired. :P
<Polarfire> how dar u.
<Polarfire> no!
<Octavia> 13Havent played WoW all day. Too much pony to keep up with. XD
<Polarfire> yeah, i know.
<Polarfire> >yfw I've already promised to buy Octavia lunch. HA!
<Octavia> 13Nervous, excited worried and everything else lately.
<Polarfire> lol. mib_r6ba9j and mib_geyi0q are the same person.
<mib_r6ba9j> what?
<Polarfire> and sorry to hear about that D:
<Octavia> 13Moving soon. To a Brony house. Nervous about that. Just before my Birthday too. On the day of the premier of MLP they're having a party too and tuning into the stream here. Course, I'll miss it kinda being busy here. XD Then on the weekend after my Birthday all us and probably some other Bronies are going to hit up the Ren Fest.
<prince-dari> >If I offer her money to buy you lunch, she'll do it
<prince-dari> :P
<mib_r6ba9j> what are we watching?
<Octavia> 13Dont think anyone is streaming right now at all.
<Polarfire> Is Octavia a girl or a guy?
<Polarfire> I know the pink text and name....
<Polarfire> but I got the impression he/she was a guy when talking to them.
<prince-dari> Girl.
<Polarfire> oh.
*Polarfire starts kicking things for Sumica
*Sumica glares at mirc
<Polarfire> but of course... She's moving soon....
<Sumica> it was fine right up untill I was no longer looking at it.
<Octavia> 13 29.. 29 custom pony toys on Ebay I'm watching
<Polarfire> yes
<Polarfire> watch them
<Octavia> 13Confound these ponies, they drive me to overspend
<Octavia> 13Some get so so high
<Octavia> 13Need to get that airbrush already, make my own lol
<Polarfire> Serious question. Would you ever move to America?
*Polarfire is plotting to buy Dari and Octavia lunch.
<Octavia> 13Dat plot
<Octavia> 13I mean... yay lunch <3
<Polarfire> >_>
<Polarfire> I want to buy you lunch before you move away.
<Polarfire> wb
<Sumica> unlike this program
*Polarfire pats
<prince-dari> I'll pay you to buy Polarfire lunch, Octavia.
<Polarfire> no he won't.
<prince-dari> Yes, I will.
<Polarfire> Don't take it.
<prince-dari> Do you have paypal?
<Polarfire> No!
<Octavia> 13lol XD
<Polarfire> no!
<Polarfire> I will accept none of this!
<Polarfire> I'm buying BOTH of you lunch!
<Octavia> 13You guys are cute <3
<prince-dari> Move? I'm not sure. Not that keen on the gun laws, but other than that, yeah it's possible.
<prince-dari> Pretty likely work could take me there I suppose.
<Octavia> 13I will have BOTH of you shipped... err, I mean lunch... yeah...
<Sumica> I feel like I am seeing only half of a conversation.
<prince-dari> MFW I'm being serious
<Polarfire> another serious question. this time legitimately serious as in no joke whatsoever. Would you move to a Caribbean island with me?
<Polarfire> And yeah, lots of computer jobs in the states
<Octavia> 13Something tells me we're all too far away to have lunch together <3
<Polarfire> Octavia you don't remember? :P
<prince-dari> If we could afford it, sounds good, but where would we work?
<Polarfire> Well Dari is right now :(
<prince-dari> Hence me paying you to buy lunch for him.
<prince-dari> Because we've been going over this for a while.
<prince-dari> And I'm determined for my money to get Polarfire lunch.
<Sumica> Octavia I did't know.
<Sumica> http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/235/9/6/dj_octavia_by_niban_destikim-d47mg1d.jpg
<Polarfire> hmm.... Excellent question. Well, your money pretty much triples down there since the average income is so low. So you can retire down there after about 1/3 of your normal working life.
<Octavia> 13I saw that comic too Sumica X3
<Octavia> 13And yeah, maybe I'm a little distracted and lost :P
<Polarfire> that convo we had....
<Octavia> 13O rly?
*Octavia 13is lost, eeeyup
<prince-dari> Hah.
<Octavia> 13Now I know. lol
<Octavia> 13Forgot.
<Octavia> 13So hectic lately, cant remember things so well. XD
<prince-dari> MFW read that as heretic
<prince-dari> BECAUSE YOU ARE HERETIC!
<prince-dari> :+SDAFLP{GLAW$)erklg0-azeglp[werlp[awejk490gop,al sd;fg>wLPP{GKOAEGLP{SDfg
<Octavia> 13So heretic lately...
<Octavia> 13INDEED!
<Octavia> 13<3
<prince-dari> <3
<Octavia> 13Thats hawt though, right?
<Octavia> 13Yes it is.
<Polarfire> <3
<Polarfire> wait, what gun laws are you talking about?
<Polarfire> wb
<Sumica> Death to mirc, back on Mibbit
<Octavia> 13Hah :P
<Polarfire> aww...
<prince-dari> Being allowed to own one. :P
<Sumica> Will take the time to care and figure out what's wrong with it after I sleep.
<Polarfire> oh. yeah.
<Sumica> Besides I like that this one makes links I can click on.
<Polarfire> It's not as big of a problem as you might think. The ones who are going to kill people with a gun are the same people who would switch to using knoves to kill people if you take guns away.
<Polarfire> In my experience, at least.
<Polarfire> That being said, I'm not pro-firearm.
<Polarfire> Xchat does that :P
<Polarfire> Also that comic is hilarious XD
<Sumica> Liked one of the comments, "Angry Sax"
<prince-dari> Yeah, but guns make it easier to kill people than knives. :P
<Dashite> Mirc makes links... it just doesn't highlight them.
<prince-dari> Pretty sure you can make it highlight them.
<prince-dari> MFW touching metal to outer case of my PC sparks.
<prince-dari> >touch it anyway
<prince-dari> Didn't shock me, but still. XD
<prince-dari> That's weird.
<Sumica> yeah i can right click menu them but prefer this way. But still trying to figure out wtf i can do to fix it's nondescript error.
<prince-dari> Right click?
<prince-dari> No.
<prince-dari> Double click them.
<prince-dari> They open. :P
<prince-dari> The error, meh. That's weird.
<Sumica> Every thing I see is all from ages ago early 2000's and nothing is resloved, just the standard canned responses about fire walls and your router sucks.
<prince-dari> Probably true.
<prince-dari> :P
<prince-dari> >cannot copy file
<prince-dari> >not enough free space
<prince-dari> >drive has 800 GB of free space
<prince-dari> THE FUCK ARE YOU ONE?!
<prince-dari> ON*
<prince-dari> >file it says it can't copy is 374 kb big
<prince-dari> WHAT THE FUCK?
<prince-dari> ARE YOU SERIOUS?!
<prince-dari> MFW accidental copy-paste there
<prince-dari> XD
<Sumica> ooooook
<Octavia> 13lol XD
<Octavia> 13I see your host Sumica... :P
<prince-dari> :P
<prince-dari> Everyone sees everyone's host.
<prince-dari> Except no one sees my host
<Octavia> 13This is true
<Dashite> I noticed that.
<Octavia> 13Hmm
<prince-dari> Because vhosts.
<prince-dari> You can have your host as whatever you want it to be.
<Polarfire> true. But the people who get arrested for murder are usually pretty violent to begin with. Lots of history of assult/violence.
<Octavia> 13hax0rz
<Polarfire> (again, in my experience at least)
<Octavia> 13:P
<Sumica> It's ok if you see my host they will probably change the company name again soon it's been almost a year.
<prince-dari> Oh nevermind.
<prince-dari> The file it couldn't copy is 5.3 GB
<prince-dari> 4GB is max file size on FAT32.
<Polarfire> can you see my host? :P
<prince-dari> Which is the only format PS3 recognises.
<prince-dari> I can see your IP.
<Polarfire> >_>
<Polarfire> how do I fix that.
<prince-dari> You can't.
<prince-dari> I'm running the server.
<prince-dari> I can see everyone's.
<Sumica> unplug your system
<Polarfire> lulz
*Octavia 13hax0rz Dari
<Sumica> You know i bet it's the stupid IP mask that is pissing off mirc.
<No_This_Is_Hax0rz> 13Screw you Dari XD
<prince-dari> :P
<prince-dari> Trololo
<Dashite> And that is why Dari should not have admin. :p
<prince-dari> Pfft.
<prince-dari> Well, we're switching soon anyway.
<Sumica> oh dear
*PrincessMolestia 13drags Dari off to her room
<Dashite> Again?
<prince-dari> Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
<PrincessMolestia> 13Angry sex? Angry sex!
<prince-dari> Dashite: Yeah, this network isn't gunna handle 4000+ people.
<prince-dari> :P
<Dashite> Angry Sax
<PrincessMolestia> 13Haha XD
<Sumica> you gues swaping irc servers proably wont change my system not geting along with mirc.
*prince-dari leaves nail marks on the ground
<prince-dari> Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

<PrincessMolestia> 13Its a party up in this bitch!
*Polarfire claws at the ground below him

<Dashite> Dari so far.

*PrincessMolestia 13licks chops

<Dashite> Oh, lol
<prince-dari> >Why the word skittles and all associations are ruined for me forever
<Synros> hey Luna, did I every show you that picture of the hub I took in LA?
<prince-dari> IT'S HORRIBLE
<Dashite> But the story was hilarious.
<Sumica> that is odd
<Dashite> "So if prince Solaris is a guy, and all the ponies in this universe are gender-bent, then does that mean his royal guard is composed entirely of female ponies?"
<Luna> 07wat am I watching...?
<Synros> i mean how lonely do you have to be?
<prince-dari> Luna: The very worst mankind has to offer
<Sumica> it's cute but freaky
<Synros> very...freaky
<Synros> i want it.
<Synros> NOAW
<Sumica> lol the matrix jump rope
<Synros> expect I was a pony instead of a tiger
<Synros> or maybe even a dragon
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Synros> yah..thats cool, a dragon
<Sumica> The kid was really selling it there at the end.
<prince-dari> Programs from homebrew devs are fun.
<Synros> screw the jump rope
<prince-dari> >finishes
<prince-dari> >dialog comes up
<prince-dari> >it says: "Done :) !"
<prince-dari> :D
<Synros> did Luna hide when i started talking?
<Synros> lol probably annoyed the crap out of her the past couple days
<Polarfire> what is this Dari?
<Polarfire> Whatcha talking about I mean
*Synros is forever a Bronly
<Luna> 07nah
<Luna> 07Luna is trying to keep her eyes open
*Polarfire is failing
<Luna> 07why would you annoy the crap out of me and how?
<Synros> not on purpose of course, but just asking you so many questions
<Luna> 07questions... my brain is mush...
<Sumica> "hey luna, was the moon cold?" stuff like that?
<Polarfire> D:
<Synros> no the moon isn't cold
<Synros> just the dark side yah.
<Synros> and the sun isn't that hot
<Synros> ont he cold spots
<Synros> ....
<Synros> i suck
<Luna> 07the moon... the view from here it's beautiful
<Synros> brb I gotta do somthing
*PrincessMolestia 13is looking at renaissance outfits for next Ren Fest trip later this month <3
<Choco_Taco> I need ponies.....lots of ponies
<WhatPayne> Hm?
<Choco_Taco> eh, just being random....I guess
<Choco_Taco> >.>
<Choco_Taco> sorry
<WhatPayne> We all need ponies in our lives.
<Choco_Taco> true true
<Sumica> ok damn this game http://ponyvspony.artix.com/. It's distracted me from what i was doing
<Choco_Taco> I must try this
<Sumica> be warned the song will infect you.
<Choco_Taco> too late lol
<Synros> i r back
<Sumica> Welcome back.
<RobotPinkie> mornin' ponies
<Choco_Taco> it's addicting!!!!
<GGgala> wut? lol
<Sumica> Morning RobotPinkie , and yes it is Choco_Taco
<RobotPinkie> what's addicting?
<Sumica> http://ponyvspony.artix.com/ dat
<RobotPinkie> lol oh okay, yeah
<Choco_Taco> it only lacks the derp
<WhatPayne> Oh dammit now I'm playing it
<Sumica> the title song alone is of ear wig quality.
<Choco_Taco> how many others know of this game?
<WhatPayne> idk
<Sumica> well it was posted on eqd a few days ago
<Choco_Taco> we must spread it out to the world like peanut butter on toast
<Sumica> oh and fight the highest level ones you can. level is equal to the exp gained.
<Synros> well cya later everyone.
<Sumica> level 4 is the norm, level 5 takes a metric ton of exp to reach, have only seen one so far.
<Sumica> Laters Synros
<WhatPayne> cya
<WhatPayne> I have no idea of what I'm doing with this game
<Choco_Taco> just have fun
<WhatPayne> I am
<Sumica> yellow attacks, red puts up defence and blue is um blue.
<Choco_Taco> Blue is Pony Gandi at work
<Choco_Taco> power
<WhatPayne> Really? I was just swinging it
<SirSprinkles> 6SPRINKLES OUTTA FUKKEN NOWHERE
<RobotPinkie> OH SHI-
*RobotPinkie puts sprinkles on his cupcakes
<RobotPinkie> also ohay SirSprinkles
<WhatPayne> Good Afternoon, RobotPinkie
<Sumica> Again?
<Choco_Taco> POWER
<Choco_Taco> HOUR
<PrincessMolestia> 13Sprinkles always outta fukken nowhere lol
<RobotPinkie> MOLESTIA OUTTA FUKKEN NOWHERE
<Choco_Taco> They give you pop-tarts too!?!?!!?
<RobotPinkie> Wow, that sounds a lot scarier than I first imagined...
<RobotPinkie> and good afternoon, WhatPayne
<WhatPayne> So am I playing against other players, or just AI?
<SirSprinkles> 6;-; I can't Sprinklesception on this server... yet.
<Choco_Taco> other players but on auto-pilot
<WhatPayne> Oh... wait so also my pony is against others on autopilot?
<Choco_Taco> indeed
<RobotPinkie> The AI is ridiculously easy in the game...
<RobotPinkie> You make like... 20 moves in the time it does one.
<Choco_Taco> sad, ain't it
<WhatPayne> Exactly!
<Sumica> yes when you word it that way it sounds like what could happen in a dark alleyway RobotPinkie
<WhatPayne> Either this game is for KIDS, or the AI is just bad
<Choco_Taco> but what's the boss button....does it take me to the "Like a Boss" vid?
<Sumica> I think it's just the level curve is so tweeked. The higher level ones are more of a threat but with every one lv 4 it's kinda meh.
<Sumica> bosses are the things you fight to go to next level.
<WhatPayne> But if this is for kids, then why there is "Saucy Sailor Skirt"?
<Choco_Taco> ah, I see....but I wanted to see "Hit the Sauce"
<RobotPinkie> wow... so I'm gonna have to keep playing for a while to get a bit of difficulty, I guess
<Sumica> Expect many days of resets to get any thing resembling leveling.
<RobotPinkie> How many fights do you get per day?
<Sumica> I think Dai needs to get this song for his trololol-a-thons
<Sumica> no clue =p
<WhatPayne> Is there any ways to maximize profits from victory to level faster?
<Sumica> fight the highest level ones you can.
<Sumica> and make sure you hit that level up button eaach time you can.
<Sumica> On and lv1 shop stuff is free it seems
<Sumica> some point I should try the pet things.
<RobotPinkie> Pets are good, otherwise blue orbs do nothing...
<WhatPayne> Cupcake shop?
<Sumica> lol I am facing myself.
<RobotPinkie> lawl
<RobotPinkie> I got the koala just because it's cute, though... but it does help
<WhatPayne> what?
<Choco_Taco> Paradox
<WhatPayne> wait the pets does something?
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, they use the magic points you get from blue combos
<WhatPayne> moar pricier the better?
<Sumica> So what names did you all get?
<RobotPinkie> I think it depends...
<RobotPinkie> They do different things
<RobotPinkie> and I'm "Lord Blueberry Snuggle" :P
<WhatPayne> :D "Pink Cupcake Friendship"... It does not take genius where I got that name
<Sumica> "Little Rainbow Lord"
<Choco_Taco> "Fluffy Blueberry Cupcake"
<WhatPayne> The bird looks cute, but it's the cheapest of the bunch...
<Sumica> oki yeah pets help stomp fast
<RobotPinkie> and suddenly I only get lvl 1-2 opponents :(
<Sumica> damn just had a 20 yellow combo
<RobotPinkie> wow...
<Choco_Taco> I salute you brony
<PrincessMolestia> 13These Pinkiequest videos from Seattle are awesome. I want to be apart of it, fun. <3
<PrincessMolestia> 13Well, the Princess is retiring to her bed for the night. Goodnight all you crazy ponies that aren't probably paying attention to the chat. :P
<Sumica> Night PrincessMolestia
<RobotPinkie> Tried to say night, but then Molestia's name was gone... I are so late
<Choco_Taco> is lvl 5 possible on the first day?
<WhatPayne> Let's see. I just reached lv4
<FreezeFrame> Good morning, BronyState
<Choco_Taco> Morn'n
<RobotPinkie> mornin' FreezeFrame
<RobotPinkie> and I doubt it, Choco_Taco
<WhatPayne> morning
<RobotPinkie> if you only fight level 5 ponies, that's 50 * 5 = 250 xp
<WhatPayne> what, you need 640 to get lv5. No way
<WhatPayne> There are no lv5 ponies... I've yet to see one.
<SirSprinkles> 6Cleverbot... not sure if trolling or just very dumb...
<Choco_Taco> time to do the impossible
<Choco_Taco> found a lvl 5
<Choco_Taco> lol
<Choco_Taco> "Starlight Sugar Sprinkles"
<Sumica> Idoubt it, it takes 650 exp just to go from 4-5
<Sumica> right read ahead then answer >_<
<Sumica> side note is seems the game slows down and the bots get dumber the longer you play.
<Choco_Taco> lame. . .
<RobotPinkie> I've seen several lvl 5 ponies... so they exist...
<Sumica> and a 95 marshmallow seems to be the highest rank of lv 4
<Sumica> I have changed my mind you all get to watch me play this Thursday =p
<WhatPayne> Level 5 is nothing but old mares tale.
<RobotPinkie> They're just as easy as lvl 4 ponies, btw
<Sumica> It's the lv5 in the moon.
<Sumica> Just wait till you face yourself, it's like Scott pilgram all over again.
<Choco_Taco> without the cool 8-bit bgm?
<Sumica> Exactly
<Choco_Taco> Do I still get the "Power of Love"?
<Sumica> Nope, power of self confidence.
<Sumica> Oh and I derped my name. It was Rainbow little lord
<WhatPayne> Thanks to you I had to put Power of Love on
<Choco_Taco> lol
<Sumica> Ok you can keep playing past the 50 battles but no exp, just cash.
<Sumica> 7888-8022 Friend code.
<RobotPinkie> oh, that's cool anyway.
<RobotPinkie> 5149-6E58 that's mine
<Choco_Taco> 10268-65BA is mine
<WhatPayne> 10271-DFE1
<Sumica> not sure if it works.
<SirSprinkles> 6SOFN
<Choco_Taco> Then we must fix it like a Russian
<Sumica> ah have to log out and back in.
<WhatPayne> omg, my first lv5
<Sumica> What's that SirSprinkles?
<RobotPinkie> Sprinkles Outta Fukken Nowhere, presumably
<Sumica> Ahhhh
<WhatPayne> well that was esay
<WhatPayne> *easy
<Sumica> also I was wrong, you get exp but no cash.
<WhatPayne> I tried to friend you all, but it does not seem to work
<Sumica> need to refresh the game and they request show up on the list
<RobotPinkie> ahh
<Sumica> So yeah do you all hate me for show you this now?
<RobotPinkie> You're the one who linked it yesterday?
<WhatPayne> I was supposed to be doing something else, but alas PVP
<RobotPinkie> I try to accept friend request, but it just gives me the "I can has error" page
<Sumica> Yeah i linked it yesterday.
<Sumica> reload again, it did the same to me.
<RobotPinkie> I've reloaded several times :(
<WhatPayne> Ohey,Rainbow Little Lord
<Choco_Taco> Random question....any tips on painting eyes on custom ponies?
<Sumica> use paint? *shrug*
<WhatPayne> Sorry, I actually am about to (in some very near future) going to attempt using water transfer inket print vinyl... I go the idea from ponychan where someone did it with good result...
<Sumica> ahhh. yeah my art is cooking not well art.
<Choco_Taco> oh snap, the rematches with the bosses are better than the first go
<Choco_Taco> So kinda like Gunpla models?
<Sumica> oki it's geting early so I am gonna go ptfo.
<Sumica> Have fun.
<RobotPinkie> later Sum
<RobotPinkie> lol
<AndroiDaz> What happened to RD server?
<WhatPayne> hm?
<AndroiDaz> Well you probably didnt notice using a PC but im on a client called 'andchat' for Android and I cant connect to Rainbowdash server.
<AndroiDaz> So i guessed we were on fluttershy server as that was also owned by bronyserv. I guess i was right but what did happen to RD server?
<WhatPayne> I connect straight to irc://irc.bronyserv.co.cc/Bronystate
<WhatPayne> From ChatZilla
<RobotPinkie> ohai AndroiDaz
<AndroiDaz> Irc fluttershy and RD are the threw domains there. Yesterday we were on RD
<AndroiDaz> Sup RObotpinkie. Yall can now tell when im on a phone. Im slower and cant really link ya to places so yea...
<RobotPinkie> pretty sure the "irc" one just redirects you to one of the available servers
<WhatPayne> Which removes the hassle...
<AndroiDaz> And Rd was available yday but not now
<RobotPinkie> Doesn't really matter which server it is as long as it works, right?
<WhatPayne> As to why we're on fluttershy and not RD is beyond me. I'm not that good with IRC tbh
<WhatPayne> Right
<AndroiDaz> Agreed
<AndroiDaz> And mysadfacewhen dubs out in 6 languages currently airing. But not german or spain te two i want. Whyyyyyy
<RobotPinkie> They don't seem to be airing in Swedish, which is weird... because there are three episode on Youtube
<WhatPayne> Oh please. You would not get me watching Finnish FIM with fiery pitchfork.
<AndroiDaz> Heh
<RobotPinkie> I wouldn't watch the Swedish dub either, but with DTV you can switch language tracks :P
<DecapMobile> Hey bronies
<AndroiDaz> Sup. Two here on phones? Lol.
<RobotPinkie> ohay Decap
<WhatPayne> I don't actually know whether the ones from TV (if they actually air them atm) have the option to switch language. I know some broadcasts have that option, but it really depends on from which channel it (would) airs.
<WhatPayne> Last battle of the day
<AndroiDaz> Phone day? Phone day.
<AndroidPinkie> Ohay ponies!
<WhatPayne> Daz is that you?
<AndroidPinkie> Who?
<WhatPayne> AndroiDaz
<RobotPinkie> That's Daz, yeah.
<AndroiDaz> hmm?
<WhatPayne> Uh, never mind.
<AndroiDaz> In about 30 mins i can use my laptop. Ill be Daz there of course
<WhatPayne> Ah, so you are Daz
<DecapKing> hey bronies
<AndroiDaz> Hmm i am.
<WhatPayne> Hello DecapKing
<AndroiDaz> Sup
<DecapKing> waiting for my Eggo waffles to finish toasting
<DecapKing> suffering from one hell of a caffeine hangover
<AndroiDaz> Ha...! Cant handle it
<WhatPayne> Deliberate or coincidental hangover?
<DecapKing> deliberate
<DecapKing> i had 3 5 hour energy shots last night
<WhatPayne> Oh, long night then?
<AndroiDaz> 15hours or...one helluvan hour :P
<DecapKing> one hell of an hour
<Pegacorn> Ohai everypony

<AndroiDaz> Why's *
<DecapKing> because i am a bear
<AndroiDaz> Sure, why not...
<Pegacorn> Bear?Why not.
<DecapKing> but the real reason is i just hate the fact that she destroyed my house
<AndroiDaz> "ha it was prettt funny right" "well um no youre the one laughing i have no house now" "hey you want some mmmmBananas?"
<Pegacorn> My house is Celestia-proof.
<DecapKing> no, but do you want an arrow piercing your skull?
<AndroiDaz> "Can i interest.you in some mmmBananas?"
<Pegacorn> Nope Decap
<AndroiDaz> Just try it
*DecapKing fires an arrow into AndoriDaz's skull
<Pegacorn> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

<Dermathil> She just has to fking close her fking door
<Dermathil> (but she's too stubborn to change anything)

<DeniedExistenceMobile> Don't go to silvershipper herospirit, whatever you do.
*Polarfire uses dig
<FreezeFrame> Okay, water break
<FreezeFrame> All the talking that goes into the dramatic recording is drying enough. Doing AJ's accent on top, though?
<DeniedExistenceMobile> 0_o they are getting pretty into it in there...
<Pegacorn> Just so you know,i hate this.
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Admit it, you love it.
<DeniedExistenceMobile> ~You can't hide your true feelings from this sociologist Pegacorn~
<Pegacorn> Nope.avi
<RobotPinkie> wat goin on?
<Pegacorn> Son,WHY DO YOU HATE ME?
<DeniedExistenceMobile> ~You wouldn't be in there otherwise~
<RobotPinkie> ...wat?
<Pegacorn> You don't wanna know RobotPinkie.
<DeniedExistenceMobile> RobotPinkie Oh, pegacorn is trying to deny he is having fun with his RP, but he is still in the room~
<RobotPinkie> oh okay
<DeniedExistenceMobile> My head is full of fuck and I love it!
<Nittany_Tiger> Fuck is a substance?
<Razyn> Yes.
<Razyn> And it's also holy,
<Nittany_Tiger> 'cause I have 3 lbs of son of a bitch I would like to trade.
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Supposedly, whoever came up with the humours of the body theory pretty much said so.
<Nittany_Tiger> And some damn.
<Nittany_Tiger> I have so much damn, beavers are jealous of me. :p
<DeniedExistenceMobile> If somebody had told me in january that I would be watching sexual pony RP, I would have punched them out.
*Dermathil heads off to terraria
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Lol, herospirit left.
<GGgala> couldn't take all the raep, i suppose.
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Bye Dermathil
<Nittany_Tiger> That was sexual?
<DeniedExistenceMobile> I suppose that depends?
<Nittany_Tiger> I feel like making a quote database for this site now.
<Nittany_Tiger> Or channel.
<Nittany_Tiger> Just to record the funny things said in here.
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Like what?
<DeniedExistenceMobile> And yes, do that.
<RobotPinkie> ....wat?
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Make a doc of funny BronyState IRC quotes.
<Nittany_Tiger> Never built a website before, though. Off to tutorial books!
<Nittany_Tiger> Create an online log of funny quotes in this channel.
<RobotPinkie> There's already a site for funny pony IRC quotes
<Nittany_Tiger> Or network
<Nittany_Tiger> Oh ok.
<Nittany_Tiger> We could still have our own.
<RobotPinkie> Don't remember the url, it was on EQD anyway
<RobotPinkie> ...and true, we should
<RobotPinkie> seems the other one never took off anyway... there's one single actual chat quote on it
<FreezeFrame> There's a pony version of bash.org? It seems like the name would be ponybash.org or something
<RobotPinkie> that'd be much better
<FreezeFrame> Okay, 3 sections of Witch of the Westmareland done
<RobotPinkie> This is the one I'd seen, but as is obvious from a second look, it never took off http://equestria.co.cc/
<FreezeFrame> The flutterpie one is horrible
<RobotPinkie> Not many people even got the point, seemingly...
<RobotPinkie> so uh... go for it Nittany_Tiger
<Nittany_Tiger> The majority of those are show quotes.
<RobotPinkie> There's like one actual IRC quote
<Nittany_Tiger> Ok. I know someone that's done a QDB for their network, so I can get help there.
<RobotPinkie> Whoever made it should have kick-started it with some funny IRC quotes
<Nittany_Tiger> I'll go get a new HD for my linux PC then.
<Nittany_Tiger> Set it up for IRC as well.
<WhatPayne> Hello again, what did I miss?
<Nittany_Tiger> Read up.
<WhatPayne> Well, nothing important I hope
<RobotPinkie> fuck, I read that as "Ponified Doom" and got somewhat excited...
<GGgala> lawl, me too, RP
<Nittany_Tiger> I did as well.

<Nittany_Tiger> I wasn't thinking of the video game, though.

<Nittany_Tiger> I wasn't here when you streamed that.
<Denied_Existence> Frikken playing xbox while noming on a burger, with my laptop in my lap.
<Denied_Existence> Oh, and my iPhone next to me streaming music live.
<FreezeFrame> Okay, class time again
<Denied_Existence> Bye FreezeFrame
<RobotPinkie> I wasn't here for The Room on BMN, but I'd watched it already...
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm trying to grade papers while chatting with you all.
<GGgala> i don't think it was on BMN. it was on during the week?
<Nittany_Tiger> My first night was the Se7en/A Pig's Tale night.
<MeteorVenture> my first night was the room
<MeteorVenture> and i missed a bit of it:/
<Hat> want me to stream something
<FreezeFrame> That's not a dorm room, that's a res hall floor
<FreezeFrame> That guy's gotta be RA
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm so glad that they ran out of freshman dorms during my first year of 4-year uni.
<Nittany_Tiger> I was put in a larger room.

<Nittany_Tiger> Cool story mark, brony.
<GGgala> FreezeFrame: the upperclassmen dorms were old and crappy compared to the shiny new freshman dorms from what i saw
<DecapKing> what are you talking about?
<Nittany_Tiger> University dorms.
<Denied_Existence> This anon...is quite strange
<DecapKing> this anon is just being a troll
<Nittany_Tiger> More random than me.
<GGgala> oh look, we got a replacement.
<RobotPinkie> Replacement for what?
<DecapKing> you
<RobotPinkie> Well, that's very nice of you.
<WhatPayne> Are we getting stream tonight?
<interior_gummy> anyone else getting an asian dating ad?
<RobotPinkie> I think so, but I haven't seen Sathi around
<RobotPinkie> It's not official streaming hours, exactly, so....
<WhatPayne> Sathi would not let us down
<RobotPinkie> I don't get any ads, btw...
<DecapKing> i did once or twice gummy
<RobotPinkie> sometimes they seem funny enough that I regret using adblock for a second

<Sumica> CSI vegas had them.
<Apokalipse> welcome back dari
<Sumica> Welcome back Dari
<prince-dari> Thanks
<Apokalipse> Your computer still giving you problems?
<Razyn> Okay... That was weird. Chat froze up on me or something.
<Apokalipse> Suddenly: RBD and Luna
<DecapKing> ONLY 3 MORE CHAPTERS!
<WhatPayne> I have some issues with the stream...
<Razyn> Such as?
<WhatPayne> Freezing every few seconds, then skipping to proper place
<RobotPinkie> caruso can only act one emotion, and that's the emotion of being awesome
<Apokalipse> Stream is fine for me
<WhatPayne> RobotPinkie, sill awake? How's your stream?
<Razyn> That happens to me every week or so as well
<Dashite> Stream seems fine here.
<Zephirdd> btw, what is it that we are watching now?
<RobotPinkie> not looking all the time, but it seems to work mostly fine
<WhatPayne> I think sometimes this happens to us in EU
<Nittany_Tiger> My stream is fine.
<WhatPayne> Ok, there goes my theory out the window... :/
<RobotPinkie> sometimes image gets stuck a seconds or so, but not skipping
<Apokalipse> I'm from the EU and I don't get many problems. Not on my part anyway. When there is lag others have it too
<mib_rke8z3> for whatever reason if you saturate you upstream bandwidth it can cause the stream to skip.
<Razyn> When I have lag, it's after not watching for a couple of days. Then it's all good.
<WhatPayne> My ping to bronystate is 164ms average...
<Sumica> that was odd
<RobotPinkie> got terminated there...
<Sumica> same
<Dashite> Same here.
<WhatPayne> Oh yeah, what was that?
<Razyn> Terminated?
<Dashite> IRC derped.
<WhatPayne> Suddenly bunch of you went "Software caused connection abort"
<Razyn> Oh. Same for me, I think.
<Razyn> ...But earlier.
<Sumica> thank you sccots

<Dashite> At least your name doesn't have a _ in the middle.
<WhatPayne> Wait there IS a way to respond to someone without manually typing their name?
<RobotPinkie> camelcasing ftw!
<Luna> 07eeeyup
<Sumica> yes type a few leters then hit tab
<RobotPinkie> just type first letter/couple of letters and hit tab, yeah
<WhatPayne> Sumica: Just blew my mind!
<Dashite> If there is more than one person with that combination, hitting TAB again will cycle through them.
<Luna> 07:D
<Sumica> or hit first letter then tab thought them.
<Ziltoid> oh hai ponies
<Dashite> And no Sumica, I wasn't the one who mentioned it to you.
<Sumica> Hi Ziltoid
<Ziltoid> whats this?
<WhatPayne> What else there is about IRC I'm not aware of?
<RobotPinkie> sparta
*Dashite totally did not just learn about this feature right now.
<Sumica> CSI Maiami
<Dashite> WhatPayne probably a lot.
<WhatPayne> probably
<RobotPinkie> what Sumica said
<Apokalipse> What just happened?
<Apokalipse> I got Terminated says the chat
<Sumica> It seems to be acting up alot today Apokalipse
<Dashite> IRC derp
<RobotPinkie> it's spelled salami tho
<Apokalipse> The chat is now the terminator
<Sumica> and the superglue test
<RobotPinkie> sarah connor?
<RobotPinkie> she sounds a bit like cuddy
<Sumica> Wait you can do that?
<RobotPinkie> ...do wat?
<Sumica> Check your self out of a hospital after being in a coma.
<RobotPinkie> i guess if everything checks out?
<RobotPinkie> they're not the police, so...
<Apokalipse> I don't think they can keep you there against your will...
<Zephirdd> afaik it depends on the country Apokalipse
<Zephirdd> I dont know where this movie is from so I cant say for it
<Apokalipse> It's CSI: MIAMI
<Dashite> CSI Miami...
<Sumica> true, there would have to be a medical reason, but yeah kinda odd they would just let em out.
<Zephirdd> I didnt knew :>P
<Zephirdd> what I know is that, in Brazil, if medics determine you are in critical condition you are forced on the hospital, or you are charged and jailed(AND hospitalized) for suicide attempt
<Sumica> and they lost me, no way a shoe could FOD out an engine.
<Zephirdd> and yeah, suicide is a crime
<Apokalipse> I'm still sure you can't open a door in a flying plane
<DecapKing> what are you watching?
<Sumica> CSI
<Zephirdd> CSI:Miami I guess
<Zephirdd> internet kinda fucked up where I am
<Ziltoid> When did the stream start?
<Zephirdd> so I'm not really watching
<Luna> 07oh wow...
<Zephirdd> you can open it if the plane isn't pressurized, although you may feel a little dizzy
<Zephirdd> but you wont just fly away like on a pressurized plane
<DecapKing> hey Luna
<Apokalipse> oh
*Zephirdd hopes 'pressurized' is the right word
<Sumica> it is
<DecapKing> it is
<Sumica> Problem is though, the doors open in not out.
<Sumica> Tells you how old this ep is, No helmet on the bike rider.
<WhatPayne> hm?
<Ziltoid> dem sunglasses
<WhatPayne> paused?
<RobotPinkie> lol that's a creepy pause picture
<Luna> 07eeeyup

<RobotPinkie> she's staring at my stuffed animal :(
<Zephirdd> indeed

<Sumica> House must be dreaming.
<InsertCupcake> hugh is kinda hairy but I would go as far to call him a Gorilla
<Apokalipse> Ohai, I'm House. I'm just being AWESOME
<DecapKing> i can tell you whats going on
<DecapKing> but i wont
<Sumica> It's LUPIS!

*WhatPayne can't make clever Luna hug thing
<RobotPinkie> \o Dashite
<Sumica> he thought he could roll on water.
<WhatPayne> When I'll give Luna hugs, I see that picture with astronaut giving a hug to Luna - Luna's face in that pic
<Apokalipse> He should have done a hop skip and jump
<Zephirdd> maybe he was just on heat, and needed to cool off a bit
<WhatPayne> so sweet
<Sumica> that was a cute comic.
<WhatPayne> Indeed
<Zephirdd> huh, 'being on heat' is a wrong way to say in in English, isnt it?
<Dashite> lol
<Zephirdd> agreed with comic
<Dashite> I love healthy house. He's awesome.

*Silvermane 15in glorious silver
<Dashite> Because he owns the server.
<Sumica> yeah I was working that day luna
<WhatPayne> Why is it that everyone likes Luna so much when she got so little screen time?
<Luna> 07ahhh
<InsertCupcake> boogers measn lupus
<prince-dari> Wut
<Silvermane> 15but... this was registered to GGgala
<prince-dari> Why is everything in bold?
<Dashite> We aren't on epic-chat anymore.
<Silvermane> 15i think
<Luna> 07well i'll soon do a request the episode show again
<prince-dari> What the fuck did you do? XD
<Luna> 07;)
<Zephirdd> WhatPayne: cuz shes cute and doesnt get enough love
<Apokalipse> I think it must be lupus
<DecapKing> cause Luna is just awesome
*Zephirdd hugs Luna tightly
<prince-dari> MFW GGgala made a channel where EVERYTHING is bold for some reason.
<prince-dari> All the names, all the text.
<prince-dari> O_o
<Sumica> nah it's cool luna.
*Apokalipse hugs Luna
<Dashite> Whut?

<prince-dari> Oh whoops.
<prince-dari> Nope, not this one.
<Apokalipse> You loose the Game, but with the hug game you ain
<Dashite> LOLWUT
<prince-dari> It's because I didn't restrict the characters you can put in a channel name.
<prince-dari> Whoops.
<Apokalipse> win*
<DecapKing> i would hug tackle Luna again, but im pretty sure that she doesnt like it all that much
<Zephirdd> lose*
<WhatPayne> That must be it. 1000 years alone in moon while being so adorable creature is just huggarific
<Apokalipse> My spelling is terrific today I see...
<Silvermane> 15don't play too much with this channel... aslo, how did you find this?
<Zephirdd> :P
<Silvermane> 15did you already know about this channel?
<prince-dari> Nope.
<prince-dari> Nevermind.
<prince-dari> I have literally no fucking idea how he did it.
<Silvermane> 15okay?
<Silvermane> 15how who did what?
<Sumica> My guess is cause people want to take care of small cute things that look frail.
<WhatPayne> I'm spelling with left hand, right hand busy
<prince-dari> Join #1
<prince-dari> Everything is bold.
<prince-dari> Everything.
<prince-dari> And I don't know why.

<WhatPayne> Sumica: that too
<prince-dari> Eeyup.

<Silvermane> nothing bold for me
<prince-dari> It's all bold.
<Dashite> No bold here.
<prince-dari> Well it is for me.
<prince-dari> O_o
<InsertCupcake> I realised today that the summer sun celebration is a celebration of Luna being dispatched to the moon
<Silvermane> you're a silly filly, Dari
<Zephirdd> lol he died
<prince-dari> But it is bold!
<Luna> 07WAT!
<Dashite> But it isn't!
<InsertCupcake> IKR
<Luna> 07but i'm back now!
<Dashite> This is bold
*Silvermane sings "Silly filly, silly filly"
<Zephirdd> InsertCupcake: not really, it wasnt during that day that luna was sent to the moon
<Dashite> This is not.
<Dashite> Wait...
<Silvermane> Dashite, that second one was bold
<Dashite> That was really odd.
<Zephirdd> at least, there is no information on that
<Sumica> I thought it was a celebration of the longest day of the year.
<Silvermane> 15so how do you own my channel anyways? did someone give it over?
<Zephirdd> it should be
<prince-dari> MFW everyone is in bold, Dashite's two messages weren't in bold.
<prince-dari> O_o
<DecapKing> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/6063cfb464e9a3b412301c24077bab90/45978%20-%20Metal_Gear_Solid%20Solid_Snake%20Tactical_Espionage_Action%20artist%3AEgophiliac%20box%20cookie%20filly%20luna%20metal_gear%20woona.png
<Zephirdd> makes me wonder why isnt there a winter moon celebration
<Sumica> it just also became the same day she was banished.
<WhatPayne> Luna's back, but can she simply put behind all that time alone, in dark and cold?
<DecapKing> THIS is why we hug Luna
<prince-dari> I own it because I am God here.
<Dermathil> OHAI AGAIN
<Silvermane> lol
<Zephirdd> yeah shes too cute
<Apokalipse> yes it is

*Zephirdd hits Silvermane and hugs Luna again while shouting 'DONT TAKE HER AWAY FROM ME'
<DecapKing> aww someone stole my tackle hug idea :(
<prince-dari> I decided it'd be better to be somewhere with commercial servers by S2.
*Silvermane hugs Robotpinkie back
<WhatPayne> And then they say adult men do not show their softer side...
<Apokalipse> WARNING WARNING: The hug control unit has encountered an error
<Zephirdd> only for Luna

*DecapKing brohoofs Silvermane back
<Silvermane> also...
<Silvermare> don't presume to call me a filly
<prince-dari> Shows me all the different connections that are from the same IP.
<prince-dari> So GGgala/Two-Bits are on the same internet connection and therefore have the same IP/hostname.
<silvermane> 15ah. is that a problem?
<prince-dari> Nope.
<Sumica> Oh dear did silvermane get into the poison joke again?
<prince-dari> It's just weird that the script didn't work.
<silvermane> 15alrighty. just something to prevent multiple winners?
<prince-dari> Yeah, let's me check that no one in the chat has more than one connection up.
<Dermathil> 7Are you sure the script is working 100%?
<prince-dari> For the lottery anyway.
<prince-dari> Eeyup.
<WhatPayne> Oh he was hot?
<prince-dari> It's probably because I joined the channel.
<Dermathil> 7alright

<Zephirdd> this time, on a fountain
<Dermathil> 7maybe.

<Apokalipse> Yes. And it's not lupus
<Dashite> Addison

<Luna> 07oh this ep

<Dermathil> aww sheet
<Apokalipse> actually, it's the luna game. Whenever you remember luna you must hug luna
<DecapKing> pretty sure Luna shouldnt get hugged anymore
<silvermane> but...
<silvermane> NOOO
<DecapKing> as she is pale
<Dermathil> a case of a kid dieing of fright, I presume. Or something along those lines.
<Dashite> Dermathil yup, Videotron was what tipped me off.
<Ziltoid> NEVER MENTION THE LUNA GAME EVER AGAIN
<Dermathil> eeeeyup Dashite.

<Razyn> 11It's as big as the brown king over there!
<silvermane> 15Because I am the Mighty and Magnificent Silvermane!
<DeniedExistenceMobile> You people are silly.
<silvermane> 15yes
<Razyn> 11Forget how he knew, where did it come from?
*ReticentSmolder 5wonder what the brown king is
*Razyn 11sometimes calls Silvermane the king
<silvermane> 15So, now that we are all here, who would like to here the stories of Grout "Mortimer" the Fox Beastman, and Flamyras "The Glamorous" the Woodsman
<RobotPinkie> lawl
*Razyn 11raises a hoof
<Dermathil> stubborn peoples
<Dermathil> always causing troubles

<Dr-Luna> 07lol
<Dermathil> meth kingpin
<InsertCupcake> hi anon
<Razyn> 11Dohoho
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Can I say what happened earlier between we and Pega real quick?
<ReticentSmolder> 5Can I be the Blue King of Cinqeluer?
<Razyn> 11No
<silvermane> 15but of course
*ReticentSmolder 5wonders if people got that reference
*DeniedExistenceMobile slaps Razyn
<Dermathil> wat
<silvermane> 15not a clue, RS
<RainBroDash> 10me
<Razyn> 11*Boof*
<RainBroDash> 10gusta
<RobotPinkie> dat smile
<Ziltoid> lawl
<ReticentSmolder> hnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnng
<Razyn> 11I couldn't /read/ it RS
<Dermathil> WAT
<Ziltoid> at first he was like
<Dermathil> COLOR
<Ziltoid> but then he was like
<ReticentSmolder> 5ha HA!
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Anyway, I came in while GGgala was raping him.
*ReticentSmolder 5finished scribbling what was on his scroll
<silvermane> 15... wat
<Razyn> 11There was rape
<ReticentSmolder> 5BEHOLD! A 99 page thesis on why you're a big mean meanie pants
<Razyn> 11So much rape
<herospirit> I'm in your chat, watching your stream
<mib_l3b6nu> wow, the reaction
<Razyn> 11And accusations of rape
<mib_l3b6nu> me too
<DeniedExistenceMobile> GGgala asked him who my mother was
<DeniedExistenceMobile> (Pega is my canon father)
*silvermane is in your stream, watching your chat
<InsertCupcake> Good news everyone!
<Dermathil> DARNIT
<herospirit> Okay, I'm actually not watching the stream at the moment, but I am in your chat
<Razyn> 11Why do you think I listed rape thrice an hour ago when summarizing the chat?
<Dermathil> protein type AA
<silvermane> You just read that in Dr. Farnsworth's voice?
<InsertCupcake> loljk ur gonna die
<Ziltoid> dawwww
<mib_l3b6nu> i was the only one that laugh at him
<silvermane> 15DEM, keep going
<InsertCupcake> i used to have that song
<InsertCupcake> must redownload
<DeniedExistenceMobile> And then I learned Pega raped RD, then tried to blame her for abandoning me, which of course I didn't believe since me and RD are both the element of loyalty.
<silvermane> 15uh... huh...
<InsertCupcake> thanks Luna for giving me something to do for a few hours
<DeniedExistenceMobile> So I beat the stit out of Pega and left him unconcious.
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Shit*
<mib_l3b6nu> Yeah!
<Luna> 07Your welcome
<Ziltoid> lol
<Luna> 07tomorrow the next 3
<silvermane> 15well... alrighty then
<DeniedExistenceMobile> The end *claps*
*RobotPinkie meows at Luna
<DecapKing> what now?
<InsertCupcake> what time do you start?
<DeniedExistenceMobile> :P
<Razyn> 11Cool story bro
<silvermane> 15not the most disturbing thing i've heard on here, that's for sure.
<silvermane> 15^
<Luna> 073:30 PM EST
*Boombox tries to clap
<InsertCupcake> k cya tomorrow
*silvermane 15claps
<mib_l3b6nu> he's proud
<mib_l3b6nu> D:
<silvermane> 15so, my turn?
<Ziltoid> son, I am proud
<DeniedExistenceMobile> That's all for me, go on with your stories RS
<ReticentSmolder> 5don't you mean sjut?
<Razyn> 11...RS?
<Dermathil> Luna, how much House do we have left in total?
<ReticentSmolder> 5what stories?
<Dermathil> before Bones
<silvermane> 15he may have meant me
<Luna> 07lots ;)
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Sorry, I mean silver
<Dermathil> fffff
<ReticentSmolder> 5oh...my gosh
<Razyn> 0So what now?
<RainBroDash> 10Bones is amazing
<DecapKing> hai NightmareMoon
<ReticentSmolder> 5we've become so similar...we've done a mind meld Silvermane
<ReticentSmolder> 5we are herdmind
*silvermane hugs Luna carefully, aware of her bruised ribs and strained pinion feathers from repeated glomps. "I love you Luna, thankyou for streaming!"
<DeniedExistenceMobile> *Facehoof*
<silvermane> 15oh my
<ReticentSmolder> 5*hoofface*
<mib_l3b6nu> European Beat <3
<Luna> 07season 4 5 & 6
*DecapKing guards Luna from any more ponies looking to glomp
<Razyn> 11EcafFooh
<ReticentSmolder> 5FoHoeFac!
<silvermane> Keep up that guard, DecapKing, and alert me immediately if Madam NightmareMoon shows up. I'd like to have... /words/ with her.
<MirthTinker> 13so silver, you were saying about the balverine slaying and whatnot?
<silvermane> 15tally-ho?
<silvermane> 15ah yes
<DecapKing> SIR YES SIR!
<Razyn> 11Please tell me you said tally-ho at some point
<silvermane> 15so, this event, a friend of mine put up most of my fee in exchange for playing the beastman 'pet' that she acquired two events ago. It was originally just an item that I had npc'd, but we made it a full character with real player stats and upgradability
*Nittany_Tiger walks over and explodes
<Dermathil> >mfw what would a Bones crossover look like?
<silvermane> DAT BACKGROUND
<Pinkie_Pie> You have the same wallpaper as me.
<DecapKing> WHY AM I HERE?
<Pinkie_Pie> Because only you can break the veil of silence that has descended upon us
<silvermane> 15His name was Grout, but Maka, her character, named him Mortimer which he took a liking to.
<Nittany_Tiger> Back to paper grading. Gotta finish them all!
<DecapKing> hmmmmmmm
<DecapKing> nope.avi
<silvermane> 15he was a slave trained to do alchemy and sold in town, where she acquired him. She loves him like a pet and takes great care of him. he can speak broken common, and doesn't get many innuendos. He is naive and young, but very clever.
<silvermane> BEST SONG
<Razyn> 0Hey Luna, can I get a link to the site you use for the shows? The old ones and stuff?
*silvermane loves 'Art of the Dress' sung by 3rd-best pony.
<ReticentSmolder> 5so like an exchange student?
*Sumica glomps luna from above.
*DecapKing shoots Sumica
<silvermane> 15heh, perhaps.
*Pinkie_Pie shoots DecapKing
<ReticentSmolder> 5obvious human trafficking aside
*DecapKing detonates nuclear device
<WhatPayne> I simply cannot do the decision of which one of the mane-6 is better/worse than others
<silvermane> 15it's not illegal to sell beastmen as they are not citizens
<Pinkie_Pie> And thats how equestria was made.
*Dermathil needs to eventually DL the songs from Vol. 2
<silvermane> 15they are not protected as a citizen is either
<ReticentSmolder> 5what do beastmen look like?
<Razyn> 11Just like worms. They are not citizens.
<silvermane> 15a beastman is an anthropomorphic creature, created by the mating of an animal with an individual who has taken on an animal form, partially or entirely
<silvermane> 15a skill, animal ken, eventually lets you take on a bestial form
<ReticentSmolder> 5so...beastmen are the byproduct of some really kinky bestiality?
<silvermane> 15pretty much
<silvermane> 15Naturally, they are mostly sterile
<Razyn> 11...Pony beast people.
<silvermane> 15never heard of nor seen one
<RainBroDash> 10WhatPayne Rarity and Fluttershy and Applejack genuinely irritate me for some reason haha
<ReticentSmolder> 5I would imagine it would be hard for them to squeeze icing for cakes
<ReticentSmolder> 5such a troubled people
<silvermane> 15... so many ways to go about that statement
<silvermane> 15anywho
<silvermane> 15so I come into town, red and black tail, ears in my hair, red and white face paint for fur colorings
<WhatPayne> Not me, at first some came stronger through than others, but each and every one has grown on
<Razyn> 0And now, math...?
<Luna> 07:)
<DecapKing> what about math?
<Razyn> 0IT'S FUCKING AWESOME
<RainBroDash> 10lol:D
*silvermane is going to ignore RainBroDash saying #1 and one of the 3 #3 ponies irritate him.
<RainBroDash> 10silvermane you know it to be true
<RainBroDash> 10they suck
<silvermane> 15and I proceed to walk up behind random people, and just wait for them to notice me. I got at least 4 individuals
<Razyn> 0They have their... Better points.
<Pinkie_Pie> RainBroDash, I respect your opinion..
<silvermane> 15I'd move their stuff, yell to surprise them, generally scare and amuse myself.
<Pinkie_Pie> But you know men in white suits are gonna kidnap and take you away now
*silvermane loves Fluttershy. and Rarity is pretty sexy
<silvermane> 15at one point, Raymond, a 6.3 foot tall, black, bisexual (IRL) gypsie offers me a job in a brothel.
<RainBroDash> 10Pinkie_Pie don't let them get me D:
<ReticentSmolder> 5I thought you were an owned man?
<DecapKing> what does that mean Luna?
<Nittany_Tiger> Snap. What chat program is that?
<DecapKing> cause it looks like a lot of code
<Luna> 07that was me screwing up :D
<Razyn> 0Rarity has her class, Fluttershy has her moe, and Applejack has a strong morale. All fine points. :\
<DecapKing> indeed it was
<silvermane> 15She made it so that I am merely resident, and her 'pet' rather than a slave
<Razyn> 0Nuuuuuuuuu
<silvermane> 15since slavery is technically illegal. She'd let me go if I wanted to leave
<WhatPayne> Razyn you've got the point
<silvermane> 15in fact, she left me alone most of Friday night and a good part of Saturday
<Ziltoid> Fluttershy is best pony
<Ziltoid> The end.
<MirthTinker> 13I thought you just said it was totally legal to own a beast man
<RainBroDash> 10Ziltoid is just misguided
<RainBroDash> 10don't mind him
<Razyn> 0Once sentience is thrown in the mix, I view characters as humans.
<Ziltoid> LOLNO
<silvermane> 15so it was made to appear
<WhatPayne> However outside mane-6 the best pony...
<DecapKing> ill just stay out of this argument by hiding behind Luna
<silvermane> 15but it's hazy on whether beastmen are under the terms of intelligent beings or not
<WhatPayne> ...is Luna
<silvermane> 15chances are, he won't be called a slave, but he's obedient to her at the very least.
<RainBroDash> 10Whatpayne... it's evidently Apple Fritter then Vinyl Scratch, then Colgate, THEN luna
<RainBroDash> 10How can you not see that D:
<silvermane> 15so when raymond offers me the job, I slowly backed off from him, looking nervous.
<Pinkie_Pie> I have the solution for you
<Razyn> 0You're both wrong and silly.
<Pinkie_Pie> @pony Best Pony
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Best Pony is 14Silver S15poon
<WhatPayne> Apple Fritter close second tho
*MirthTinker 13wonders just how much Silver's way of wanting to get dominated and 'bestial fury' plays out in these rp's :P
<Pinkie_Pie> There is your answer
<Pinkie_Pie> Worship it
<Razyn> 0The best outside of the mane six is Nurse Redheart
<RainBroDash> 10@pony The pony RBD has stashed under his bed
<Steven_Magnet> 6 The pony RBD has stashed under his bed is 2The 8Wonder2bolts
<WhatPayne> interesting pick
<silvermane> 15I decided Mortimer wouldn't understand the word 'Brothel' since it's not commonly used for what he was trained in
<RainBroDash> 10-all- of them? Oh well
<Dashite> Rainbro is on the right track with non mane 6, but he put Apple Fritter and Vinyl Scratch in the wrong order. For shame RainBroDash. :/
<Razyn> 0@pony Razyn would engage in Mortal Kombat with
<silvermane> 15so eventually as he looks confused, Raymond says 'I could just eat you up', at which point, I freak and start saying he want eat foxers and no eat Mor'Mar, running off
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Razyn would engage in Mortal Kombat with is 7Scoota6loo
<Ziltoid> best non mane 6 pony is cyclops pony
<Razyn> 0O ye gods...
<Razyn> 0I have to fight the Queen of Metal
*silvermane 15would never even CONSIDER sexual relations with maka nor her player.
*MirthTinker 13wasn't insinuating that >.>
<WhatPayne> Even outside mane-6 are some tough choices... So it really is a matter of taste.
<Pinkie_Pie> Razyn, this is what your up against
<Pinkie_Pie> http://img.ponibooru.org/images/5d/5d03a4977a5eee4bac0055ad8a58c022
<Pinkie_Pie> Dat link...
<RainBroDash> 10nice link bro
<silvermane> 15Later on, whenever I see him, I shy away, and try to run off. if he managed to get up close before I could run or get around him, he'd scratch my ears, to which i'd stop moving and slowly lower down as if it was enjoyable
<Flutteryay> OHMYGOSH OHMYGOSH OHMYGOSH OHMYGOSH OHMYGOSH!
<Razyn> 0inorite
<Flutteryay> My remix made it to EqD
<FreezeFrame> Awesome!
<Flutteryay> Yup
<silvermane> 15i'd jump away and fix up my hair, as well as move distrustingly away from him once he let up
<Flutteryay> At the Gala ~ SEGA Genesis Mix
<RainBroDash> 10Flutteryay sick D:
<FreezeFrame> Best non-Mane Six is Cheerilee
<RainBroDash> 10Which is yours?
<RainBroDash> 10Oh nice
<FreezeFrame> I hope we hear a story from her. ;)
<Flutteryay> And I got in with Chain Algorithm too!
<silvermane> 15later on, when it came up, I said he offer job in broth, and Mor'Mar no want be soup.
<WhatPayne> But which non mane 6 pony I absolutely don't like?
<FreezeFrame> Hopefully, I'll have my first fanfic ever finished by the end of the month
<WhatPayne> Snails and Snips
<silvermane> 15when they tried to explain that he was offering me a job in a brothel, i said i didn't know what that was
<ReticentSmolder> 5I wonder if Tink and I are the only one's still reading this....that would make me sad
<Flutteryay> I'd be further along in my fanfic if I didn't get sick yesterday...
<Razyn> 0FreezeFrame from who, Cheerilee?
<Flutteryay> actually I got sick 2 days ago but I blamed it on the alcohol that one day
<silvermane> 15they explained using metaphors, along the lines of 'women spread their legs, women don't say no, you can get a room with a man or woman for the night' etc
<Flutteryay> Cousin's wedding reception
<silvermane> 15to which he would reply
<silvermane> 15That sound like hard way to stand
<silvermane> 15Women no say no to what? Ask questions? Not good answers if can't say no
<silvermane> 15and
<FreezeFrame> Yes, Razyn
<FreezeFrame> I had to make the joke
<silvermane> 15so it like inn? why soup place for sleeping?
*Razyn 11lurks almost as much as Dashite; Boombox moreso.
<silvermane> 15to that last one, they said 'they would keep your bed warm'
<silvermane> 15and I said "that sound silly, blanket do that"
<Razyn> 0It went over my head
*RDash drop-kicks veil, breaking it into a thousand pieces
<Razyn> 0Did you mean about her?
<silvermane> 15they gave up trying then
<Dermathil> So, is prince-dari going to stream some Doctor Who?
<silvermane> 15later on, another person more bluntly said that a brothel is a place where you can pay to get people to have sex with you
<Razyn> 11What kind of beast-man were you again?
<silvermane> 15I told them "Ooooohhh, that make much more sense. Why they not say that before? ... why have sex in broth though? waste of food"
<silvermane> 15I was a fox
<ReticentSmolder> 5okay, that last line you're just /trying/ to be difficult :P
<Razyn> 11Ah. Cause the way you spoke reminded me of the Diamond Dogs
<silvermane> 15i was trying to maintain his youthful innocence and inability to grasp the Common langauge.
*RDash purchases new veil of silence
*RDash throws it over the #bunker entrance
<silvermane> 15it got me quite a few looks whenever i'd comment that Raymond want eat foxers. Offer job in brothel. Mor'Mar no soup
<silvermane> 15and one person asked if I knew what a brothel was
<silvermane> 15and i told them "it place where have sex in soup. seem like waste of food."
<silvermane> 15i had everyone laughing at me and my innocence constantly.
<Ziltoid> prince-dari is going to troll
<silvermane> 15later on, Raymond said he'd like to toss my salad as a different metaphor, and I told him i'm not a plant
<ReticentSmolder> 5did he not learn the first time? >.>
<silvermane> 15he was just enjoying the game
<ReticentSmolder> 5hehe, I know
<Razyn> 11You sure can act innocent :P
<silvermane> 15it wasn't innocence, it was ignorance of the innuendo
<silvermane> 15but thankyou
<Razyn> 11semantics
<silvermane> 15wasn't always easy
<silvermane> 15best part was when one lady said she'd never walk past a brothel without thinking of soup again.
<herospirit> Daris gonna Dari
<herospirit> Haters gonna Hate
<silvermane> 15there was this noble lady, Lady Sophia, who I found easy to startle.
<herospirit> And then Daris are going to troll along with Dari-ing
*Nittany_Tiger gonna explode
<silvermane> 15I'd sneak up behind her repeatedly, when she was standing in a door, sitting on a bench, basically whenever she was looking away but not in the normal direction
<silvermane> 15when she'd turn back, there i was
<Razyn> 11Sneaky. Like a fox.
<silvermane> 15I had a rock thrown through my shoulder after tossing something towards her, so i didn't do that ever again
<ReticentSmolder> 5through?
<silvermane> 15later on, another character who was her guardian grabbed that shoulder and squeezed with with 5 strength, which is enough to life over 800lb
<silvermane> 15well, more like it hit me and shattered, but i like to say through
<Razyn> 11Hm. Was there much battle?
<silvermane> 15i threw the stone shards into his face and walked out in a sad huff
<silvermane> 15there were many battles, but that was later. this is mostly first and second day
<silvermane> 15to apologize for scaring her, I gave her a mug, after which i walked away
<silvermane> 15when she looked inside, there was a live mouse.
<ReticentSmolder> 5haha
<silvermane> 15she threw the cup on the ground, as her char has a phobia of mice and other vermin
<ReticentSmolder> 5did you know that?
<silvermane> 15I concluded that she liked the mouse, because "If bad mouse, she eat. If good mouse, she let go and let make more good mice"
<silvermane> 15I knew that out of game, but Mortimer believed it a proper apology gift
<prince-dari> Dari's gunna sleep.
<prince-dari> For reals.
<silvermane> 15later on, Sophia was having her wedding, to which I somehow attended. probably due to the general invite, and Maka (my owner, who is an orc and captain of the guard) went
<Dermathil> nooooooooooooooooooez
<silvermane> 15As a gift, I gave her a gold frog. non-poisonous, much harder to find
<Dermathil> agh darnit.
<Dermathil> nighty dari
<prince-dari> Night.
<silvermane> 15she took it, carefully, and gave it to her new husband Jack, who really likes animals
<RDash> G'night Dari
<silvermane> 15i have since learned that they kept the frog, and have acquired a small home for him to live in.
<Razyn> 0Goodnight sweet prinnce
<ReticentSmolder> 5how do you signal when you are speaking out of character? or is it that when you enter the rp area you never break character?
<RDash> Mods asleep! Post normally!
<silvermane> 15Jack is typically considered a hardass, many describe him as a Lawful Evil character
<silvermane> 15to talk OOC, you raise your hand above your head and say 'in-soothe' or 'out of game' or something like that
<herospirit> May your dreams be filled with Pony Dari
<silvermane> 15it's best to never break character though if possible
<prince-dari> :>
<silvermane> 15which is why Mortimer's ignorance was so well received, as I kept up the charade the whole time
<ReticentSmolder> 5how do orcs dress?
<Razyn> 11Oh god
<silvermane> 15green paint, torn up clothes
<Dashite> * Razyn 11lurks almost as much as Dashite; Boombox moreso.
<Dashite> Boombox wishes he could lurk like me.
<ReticentSmolder> 5you'd think they would buy from a tailor
<silvermane> 15Maka wears cut off, old pants, a torn up vest, and an old, stained shirt
<Kencolt> Aw... no vids.
<silvermane> 15^ you trollin' boy?

<ReticentSmolder> 5no, I mean, what did she wear to the wedding? torn clothes?
<WhatPayne> uahh... I'm way too tired. Gonna hit the sack for tonight.
<RDash> Night WhatPayne
<prince-dari> No pony lurks like Dari.
<WhatPayne> Night ya'll
<silvermane> 15oh, she just wore her regular garb. it was a Noble wedding, with physical attendance of 70k, and audience of over 1M due to projection spells
<Razyn> 11!
<herospirit> It's only 6:27 for me :0
<herospirit> Night Payne
<ReticentSmolder> 5sooo...how many attended irl?
<WhatPayne> 2:27am
<Razyn> 0Oh it's herospirit :0
<Dashite> I challenge you to a lurk off Dari!
<WhatPayne> cya tomorrow
*prince-dari lurks
<silvermane> 15in game, most of the town, which was about 25-30 people. we got front row seats due to knowing Jack and Lady Sophia
*Boombox lurks
*silvermane 15skurl
<Alliszero> Did House end? aww
*ReticentSmolder 5if I'm asking too many questions just whack me on the snout, I'll be okay then
<silvermane> 15it's fine, that's how you learn
<silvermane> 15and I'll whip you later ;)
<Kencolt> Gues I can't expecy vids every evening-- but one hopes.
<ReticentSmolder> 5...I sure hope not
<Kencolt> Even if one can't spell. annoying day...
<silvermane> 15Mortimer followed a few individuals into the woosd at one point to gather flowers for the ceremony, partly out of boredom, partly because they may need his herbalism skills to pick them safely
<Razyn> 11Silvermane/ReticentSmolder?
<silvermane> 15NOPE
<silvermane> 15.jpg
<MirthTinker> 13Silvermane...I didn't know you were into colts...or my best friends...
<Razyn> 11...I wouldn't mind seeing that...
<Razyn> 11It's like...
<Razyn> 11Big Mac and Caramel
<silvermane> 15it's been a long, homoerotic weekend. everyone is sexy out there, at least as long as i say so for jest
<RDash> Yay, at least dari-bot is still with us
<Razyn> 11Only more wings and horns
<silvermane> 15...
<silvermane> 15anyways...
<MirthTinker> 13and revealing clothing
<silvermane> 15hmm, I supose Dagnes wore some revealing garb...
<Alliszero> Yep
<silvermane> 15really it was just a tanktop and shortshorts under her leather skirt and chainmail though
<ReticentSmolder> 5you had me at leather skirt
<silvermane> 15although Kitty Lady had a lowcut bodice
<silvermane> 15it was made of various piece of leather, sewn into a many-flapped skirt/kilt like design
<silvermane> 15all brown and red
<silvermane> 15she's a barbarian char, and I do believe she likes Mortimer, or at least finds him endearing.
<silvermane> 15probably because he's so bloody adorable, and his ears/tail just add to it
<ReticentSmolder> 5so I'm guessing you're both chaotic neutral?
<silvermane> 15i know I am, just because i was trained to be obedient, first by Mother Vixen (my human mother), then the slaver that acquired me and sold me to Maka, and then i just listen to Maka
<Razyn> 11Is there any RPG you were following? Like live action version of a table top?
<silvermane> 15i do what i want, but i'm quick to respond and don't really worry about much else
<silvermane> 15carpsgame.com
<silvermane> 15rulebook is in the download section
<silvermane> 15it was made for the game specifically
<Razyn> 11Souka
<silvermane> 15in reality, there is no 'alignment' simply because real life humans don't have alignments, simply tendencies
<silvermane> 15I am typically a NG person, with lawful tendencies, but i have STRONG CE desires quite often
<silvermane> 15i wind up acting LN or TN quite often
<silvermane> 15and I ahve trouble being CN, although i'd love to try
<ReticentSmolder> 5I'm a LN, pretty much by standards and behavior
<ReticentSmolder> 5with fair LG tendencies from time to time
<Razyn> 11CN is so much fun~ But I'm usually just HN. Sort of. As hungry as you can be while being sentient.
<silvermane> 15h?
<Razyn> 11When RPing that is.
<Pinkie_Pie> Hi RDash
<Razyn> 11Hungry Neutral
<silvermane> 15uh... huh?
<ReticentSmolder> 5saw that one coming
<Pinkie_Pie> Hi RDash
<Pinkie_Pie> Lol
<silvermane> 15alrighty then
<Razyn> 11It's True Neutral, but not because you have morals. If a human was HN, it could be because he couldn't give endless fathoms of Fuck.
<Razyn> 11*you lack
<silvermane> 15so yeah, Dagnes offered to train Mortimer to use all weapons, so that i can snag any weapon in combat and use it properly
<RDash> Hey Pinkie
<ReticentSmolder> 5I like LN because my decisions can still be affected by my own moral standing, but I can always lean upon the rules when I need to
<RDash> Hey Pinkie
<RDash> Echo, echo
<RDash> :P
<silvermane> 15standard cop is a LN person, law first, justice is a different department
<ReticentSmolder> 5if you can't tell, I favor the wizard disciplines
<ReticentSmolder> 5yeah
<ReticentSmolder> 5I'm a justice first kind of guy, or at least in fantasy settings

<ReticentSmolder> 5like, if I'm on a mission, and there's somebody in need, if my mission explicitly states no detours, I won't bat an eye
<Pinkie_Pie> So bored today..
<Pinkie_Pie> Reading Fanfiction
<Pinkie_Pie> XD
<silvermane> 15ah, I'd say fuck the mission, it can wait for a few minutes
<Razyn> 11Cleric if available. RPing is weird.
<DecapKing> its quiet
<RDash> Yes, I've been doing work
<silvermane> 15it's much easier to RP in a setting where you are doing everything you want to do
<RDash> ...and reading fanfiction :P
<ReticentSmolder> 5see, there's a fine line between rationale and zealotry
<Razyn> 11NG Healer; fuck your laws, that guy is dying
<RDash> too quiet
<silvermane> 15you see and feel every swing, conversations are between real people, and everyone is only one person

<silvermane> 15it's just a very different, real experience
<silvermane> 15Mortimer went to pick flowers, with those guys like i said
<silvermane> 15and out there, vines would snag at us, pinning us to the ground, some would envelop us inside them
<silvermane> 15i was searching around for any herbalism stuff, which requires a 30 count of searching

<Pinkie_Pie> 13All that went through my mind was the Diablo games
<herospirit> 15Verstehen Sie Duetch?
<RDash> Prince Dari and the Deathly Hallows
<RDash> What does this mean!
<Pinkie_Pie> 13OperServ.. Sounds ominous
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Thanks Prince-Dari
<RDash> Yay, you have a house pinkie
<herospirit> 15Don't give up hope everyone
<herospirit> 15We can take Val
<herospirit> 15We can do it http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlicWUDf5MM
<Pinkie_Pie> 13To bad it doesnt look like a little Sugarcube Corner
<RDash> You need to mow your lawn though
<RDash> Dari didn't keep up with the landscaping
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Hmm..
<Pinkie_Pie> 13http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX-HCk6emBg&feature=related
<prince-dari> Ah ok.
<prince-dari> What I can do id drop the channel so you can reregister it.
<prince-dari> Then the owner will stick.
<prince-dari> Ok?
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Ok
<Pinkie_Pie> 13So, that means..?
<prince-dari> All yours.
<prince-dari> You just need to register the channel again
<prince-dari> Done.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Okay, I registered it under a password, that wont interfere with others joining will it?
<RDash> 0.0 so many modes
<Elky> and then everything was dead
<Elky> I'll be off to bed then
<Zephirdd> :(
<Zephirdd> 'night Elky
<RDash> is the password: password? :P
<Elky> bye
<Zephirdd> sweet dreams
<RDash> G'night Elky
<herospirit> 15If Val bleeds we can kill it. Dash discovered the key. If Val bleeds we can kill it. So repeat after me. If Val bleeds we can kill it. Here and now take a stand. We can bring down this bastard. If we stick to the PLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN
<prince-dari> Nope.
<herospirit> 15...unless Val doesn't bleed, then we're fucked
<RDash> Was that nope directed at me? XD
<prince-dari> Val bleeds caramel.
<RDash> Or hero?
<Wrek> 05Zephirdd
<RDash> Yus
<Wrek> 05pm
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Prince-Dari, is the channel password viewable by admins?
<Dermathil> >mfw there's a MLP:FiM Teamliquid thread
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Or other owners
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm on the verge of creating one in GameFront.
<prince-dari> The channel password is encrypted under the settings I've chosen, as are all passwords of registered nicks, etc.
<prince-dari> Not even I can view them.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13I see
<Nittany_Tiger> I'd likely die, though.
<Nittany_Tiger> We're not a very active forum.
<MirthTinker> 13sorry hon, I was eating dinner
<Ziltoid> can you link dermathil?
<prince-dari> Hey, Odysseus?
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Herospirit, did you listen to that Rainbow Dash Road song? Its really cool

<Dashite> And then in walked Luna...
<RDash> 9Pinkie_Pie Because you have to make sure to brush for 2 full minutes
<RDash> 9Hens the timer
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Lol
<Barry> @pony Prince-Dari
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Prince-Dari is 7Mr Br15eezy
<Luna> 07I know!
<Pinkie_Pie> 13I suppose that makes sense
<Dashite> :O
<herospirit> 15./nr PENISPENISPENIS PENIS@PENIS.com
<silvermane> 15WAT
<herospirit> 15Totally not fake
<DecapKing> yes it is
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Decap, you came back! =D
<DecapKing> i got bored
<Pinkie_Pie> 13I knew you couldnt stay away from us
<Pinkie_Pie> 13=P
*silvermane 15jumps away from MirthTinker, and gives Luna a hug, carefully though. She's probably sore from all the glomps from earlier
<herospirit> 15I'll laugh if it ends up there's someone with an email PENIS@PENIS.com
<herospirit> 15:0
*Luna nods
<Luna> 07gently please
<prince-dari> MFW YFW you /whois either me or Steven_Magnet.
<prince-dari> Or both.
<RDash> 9So, I registered it. Is anything supposed to happen?
<herospirit> 15PENIS.com, the leading email provider
<silvermane> 15(mfw I read that in Rarity's voice)
<Pinkie_Pie> 13No, but when you come into Bronystate, you will have to use ./ns identify password
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Without the . of course
<silvermane> 15what brings you to my shipping channel of sexitude?
<DecapKing> sir i say
<silvermane> 15DecapKing! Welcome, welcome
<Pinkie_Pie> 13But, it wont do anything if you dont register, as long as you have enforce turned off
<DecapKing> randomly clicking links in Dari's description
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Err.. If you dont identify
<DecapKing> and some vodka
<DecapKing> and sleep deprovation
<Luna> 07Just my curiousity
<silvermane> 15Dari's... description?
<Pinkie_Pie> What is this
*Luna giggles
<herospirit> 15"Hostname: Rainbow.Dash"
<DecapKing> what do you mean by register?
<herospirit> 15:0
<DecapKing> like with mibbit?
<RDash> 9Should I turn enforce on?
<MirthTinker> 13hey, I'm going to be afk for awhile, and when I come back I'll only have a few minutes :(
<Pinkie_Pie> 13It would prevent anyone from taking your name
<DecapKing> EXACTLY MY GOOD SIR!
<Dashite> Luna noticed how Silvermane is off the sexiness chart according to Steven_Magnet and had to see for herself.
<DecapKing> hey Luna
<Dermathil> ffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
*Luna waves
<herospirit> 15Is it worth doing, really? :0
<Dermathil> I just noticed the european owners of Space Marine already can play the game
<Luna> 07yay
<Dermathil> Y U NO CHANGE TO SEPTEMBER 6 FASTER
<Pinkie_Pie> 13You can still force someone with your name off with /ghost
<Luna> 07*starts playinh*
<DecapKing> i was just wondering how many people would be in a channel named #SilverShipper
<Luna> 07oh i dont own it :(
<Dermathil> hehehehe
<silvermane> 15we vary between 5 and 20
<Pinkie_Pie> 13But with enforce on, it gives you 30 seconds to identify, and if you dont, it changes your name to guest(random numbers)
*Luna is awaiting Serious Sammy BFE!
<Luna> 07Best friends ever!
<silvermane> 15when active, we are normally around 9 or 10
<RDash> 9Ah ok, I get it
<Dermathil> 7>mfw Decapking found his way in SilverShipper
<RDash> 9Thanks
<Dermathil> 7NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<MeteorVenture> hope you're not a REALLY slow typer
<herospirit> 15what is /ghost? :0
<silvermane> 15when we have a good story going, we peak closer to 20
<DecapKing> too many chats open at once
<MeteorVenture> and if you are copy/paste
*DecapKing heads explodes
<Luna> 07So when does the story start"?
<DecapKing> wait
<DecapKing> do i get to hurt ponies?
<silvermane> 15chances are there won't be on tonight
<Dashite> No
<herospirit> 15If I'm going to start a new email account, what would be best to start it on? Gmail for the google docs?
<RDash> 9I'm going to test it, brb
<silvermane> 15more often than not, it is a shipping RP between Silvermane and MirthTinker, occasionally a fanfic is written, and various characters come and go through out
<DecapKing> im waiting till i get my BFG
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Herospirit, help me test something real quick
<DecapKing> Big Fucking Gun
<herospirit> 15Mmmm?

<Dermathil> 7>mfw Luna is in here...
<Dermathil> 7oh snap

<DecapKing> "they said i had A-D-something, CAN WE HAVE CLASS OUTSIDE!?!?!??!
<herospirit> 15other than dun goofed and gave me your real name, Pinkie :P
<silvermane> 15well...

<Luna> 07ADHD?
<silvermane> 15there are several stories i have
<prince-dari> I'm not sure you want to hear the kind of stories that get told in here Luna. XD
<DecapKing> YOU KNOW IT!
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Mhm..
<Ziltoid> Oh yeah
<Dermathil> 7nah, ADHD means hyperactivity is included. Probably ADD.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13My main concern is that I tried to change it to something else
<Pinkie_Pie> 13And it didnt work
<Pinkie_Pie> 13>.>
<Ziltoid> I just got the nug
<Ziltoid> DERP
<herospirit> 15I'll remember your name for all of like, two hours
<Pinkie_Pie> 13I am never using a google account again D=
<Ziltoid> hub*
<Luna> 07yea I know it..
<DecapKing> 4i can never stop shaking my leg up and down!
<herospirit> 15They suck that bad?
<Dermathil> 7...
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Yeah
<herospirit> 15So I SHOULDN'T make a gmail account?
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Meh, go ahead
<MeteorVenture> google forced me to make an acc
<silvermane> 15Dermathil, ADD is not diagnosed anymore
<Luna> 07,1 better derma?
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Make a pony related email adress
<silvermane> 15ADHD means either or
<Dermathil> 7oh?
<Dermathil> 7eh
<silvermane> 15eeyup
<herospirit> 15Oh, I have a google account, but it's linked with my email.
<Dermathil> 7W/Ever
<MeteorVenture> the ransom was my youtube account which i already had for like a year or more
<silvermane> 15they just diagnose it with specifications
<Dermathil> 7Changes nothing to my acute knowledge of the subject
<silvermane> 15let's see, i have a first person story, comdedic and lightly shippy starring Silvermane and an unknown mare
<MeteorVenture> they didn't let me sign in without connecting it to a google acc
<DecapKing> 4that was actually a line from how i met your mother lol
<DecapKing> 4but i do have ADHD
<herospirit> 15My school made me get a google account : /
<silvermane> 15^
<Dermathil> 7eh...
<MeteorVenture> i hate google for that if nothing else
<silvermane> 15i have a light-ship starring Silvermane and Rainbow Dash, slightly humorous..
<herospirit> 15Yah, google is forcibly linking itself with everything...
<Dermathil> 7How are the chances of that many peoples with it in such a small chatroom...
<silvermane> 15(all the stories I have either starred me or are disturbingly cloppy)
<MeteorVenture> ya
<DecapKing> 4how else would they be Silvermane?
<silvermane> 15good question
<Pinkie_Pie> 13I hate it because it wont let me change my nickname
<silvermane> 15there is also a very good comedic shipper involving silvermane and rarity
<Nittany_Tiger> Been a long time since I played a shooter that had a superweapon.
<silvermane> 15so what story should i tell to buff my own ego?
<herospirit> 15What would be the best website to use for my recreational email?
<Nittany_Tiger> Except if Serious Sam has one.
<Nittany_Tiger> I haven't played it that far yet.
<VioletVanilla> 6Goodnight everypony~ :3
<herospirit> 15Like, for Pony and game stuff :0
*silvermane 15hugs MirthTinker, sad that she can't play very long later.

<Luna> 07yes, thanks
<RDash> I figured
<Dermathil> 7>mfw I haven't updated the Two-Bits thingy in a while...
<MirthTinker> 13also, is this Sathi/Luna?

<Dermathil> 7(reads dat Oui in Leflour voice)
<Barry> What pic did you post, Dashite?
<Dashite> Pinkie Pie with Grimlock
<Barry> ah
<DecapKing> 4there is too many things that have orange text and i get confused
<Luna> 07it is? I'm always around
<Barry> it didn't appear, that's why I asked
<MirthTinker> 13@pony the pony who keeps making me busy
<Steven_Magnet> 6 the pony who keeps making me busy is 9App3le 8Fritter
<Luna> 07,1 oh well *sits back*
<Dermathil> MrDrProfBrony: 10 minutes early. Since it should've been posted at the hour, not 10 minutes to the hour
<herospirit> 15Eeeeeeeeeeeyup. watching the brony show.
<herospirit> Did the brony show stream die for anyone else?
<Dermathil> dunno

<Pinkie_Pie> 13Wat
<silvermane> 10she better not be keeping you busy, Tinkerbelle >.>
<silvermane> 10EHEM
*silvermane 10I walked down the path, enjoying the crisp fall air.
<MrDrProfBrony> Wat
*silvermane 10I was exhausted from another day of work. It seems like everypony wants pizza these days. Thank Celestia i'm done for today, I don't think i could stand another order. Every pizza has such weird customization, and the customers seem even weirder.
*silvermane 10I mean seriously, why are half of the pizzas ordered with a hole in the middle?
<Barry> Big mac is afraid that Spike will transport the logs to Celestia, causing a head injury
*silvermane 10I glanced through the tangled mess of grey hair covering my face, towards my front door. I smiled, knowing I'd finally get a chance to rest. I had a box on my back, dinner for me and... her. It was safely strapped to my vest, which, ehem, /proudly/ declared me Pizza Pony of Little Celestia's Pizzeria

<silvermane> 3MirthTinker, if you want we can work on that Trixie encounter later on.
*silvermane 10Honestly, I hate this job. I'm only doing it for the bits, so that I can put myself through college, as a master's degree in Psychology isn't cheap .Seems like every day someone tries to pay me... in an alternative manner.
<MrDrProfBrony> steven_magnet you are full of win

<MrDrProfBrony> how did you guess my favorite song from that game
<Barry> It is?
<MrDrProfBrony> indubitably
<RDash> Alright, goognight everypony
<Barry> I'm listening to it now
<RDash> Night everypony
*silvermane 10 Why, I remember this one time, I was delivering a Pizza Cake to some guy named Goatees, man his parents must hate him, and this weirdo was outside his house with a camera. Apparently, he was expecting something film worthy.
<Barry> night, RDash
*silvermane 10I still shudder whenever I picture the leather bit in his mouth. Gah, so creepy. Although, sometimes /she/ likes some interesting things... Realizing that I had been standing outside for 4 minutes, I rushed towards my door, carefully shouldering it open.
*silvermane 10With a light flutter, I set the box down on the floor, and shrug off my vest, hanging it up on the wall. Next to it goes my hat, stained with peanut butter and cake batter.
<MrDrProfBrony> it's my favorite because of it's relatively simple music
<Barry> ah
<MrDrProfBrony> but conveys that this is going to be a pretty hard battle
<MrDrProfBrony> plus it's catchy as hell
<MrDrProfBrony> i'll be whistling that all night
<silvermane> 10(if you want to comment, feel free)
*silvermane 10 I sigh once more, glad to be home. You know, I'd have already started my own practice if it wasn't for her urging me to get my masters degree.
*silvermane 10I hate this job, but it's all worth it for her smile. I turn into the living room, box in tow. There she is, sitting on the couch watching TV.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Nooooooooo! RDash
<MrDrProfBrony> oh
<MrDrProfBrony> just got to 4:17
<MrDrProfBrony> the best part
*silvermane 10I look at her for a moment. Her coat and mane, such a perfect blend, cut just right to show her face perfectly. She had on a dress tonight, cut perfectly to display her mark, but still leaving something to the imagination. Love of my love, my dear- "Hey, welcome home sweety!"
<MrDrProfBrony> shit gets real
*silvermane 10"Hey, I brought dinner. Pineapple and Cashews, right?" I set the box on the table in front of the couch and flutter up to her. "So whatcha watching?"
*silvermane 10She leans against me, brushing my wing so that I wrap it around her. Naturally, I'm MORE than happy to oblige. "I found a scary movie. More of psychological thriller, I guess. Something about this tailor going crazy and killing her little sister and best friend." I nod my head as she leans against me, pizza forgotten.
*silvermane 10You know, that purple maned, white coated unicorn looks familiar... Owell, probably just a popular actress or something.
*silvermane 10A few hours, and two slice of cold pizza later, I find myself in the kitchen with her. She's working on preparing food for tomorrow, as apparently it's an important day. Hopefully I can get a peek at her calender before she asks me about it.
*silvermane 10Odd, it seems every other day is important. Last week was that one unicorn's birthday... Photo something. Fortunately she didn't bother me this year; perhaps she's moved on? It seems all the fillies (and a few colts) are obsessed with me. I don't quite get it, I mean, I'm not the greatest looking colt in Equestria, but wherever i go, i turn heads.
*silvermane 10It started a few years ago, with that one girl. My first filly-friend, such a beautiful pegasus. Her mane was so colorful, and her coat such a strong shade of ivory. I never thought I'd get over her. Then that griffon moved into town... Heck, I still can't believe she accepted my offer to go on a date.
*silvermane 10 Of course, that didn't last long. Nothing against them, but her brother was too aggressive about me being a follower of Celestia, rather than Horos. I mean, I'd convert if it really mattered, but not until we were married or seomthing. Not that it really mattered, I forgot one important factor. 19.SilverMane She has a beak. How the buck am I going to do
<silvermane> 10oops

I mean, I'd convert if it really mattered, but not until we were married or seomthing. Not that it really mattered, I forgot one important factor.
*silvermane 10She has a beak. How the buck am I going to do anything with that?
<DecapKing> 4(carefully?)
*silvermane 10 A few dates here, few stalkers there, and that's when I met her. I was so excited when I got her pizza order, finally something normal.
*silvermane 10I honestly was so excited when I got there, that I forgot to bring the pizza. She just looked at me like I was crazy. It probably wasn't the best move, but somehow mentioning that I was glad she didn't ask for cake batter or mayo just seemed... alright, it never seemed like a good idea.
*silvermane 10 But hey, it's not my fault! She was gorgeous! When i finally explained what happened, and she stopped backing towards the bat in the corner, we had a good laugh about it.
*silvermane 10I flew back to the shop as fast as possible, snagging her still-warm Pineapple and Cashew pizza, and brought it right back. Wouldn't you know it, she didn't have the bits on her. I almost choked on my tongue when she offered to pay me in a different manner. Colt, how I've heard THAT one before.
*silvermane 10I was almost back to the street before she noticed. Fortunately, she just meant a date, unlike the LAST filly, with her purple mane... OH SHIT! That's why that actress looked familiar.
*silvermane 10Alright, that's just down-right creepy. But at least it explains why she was so weird... wait, wasn't that little foal she killed in the movie at her shop? What kind of mare would let her daughter... nevermind.
*silvermane 10Naturally, I was intrigued by the date offer. After all, she was one of the most beautiful fillies I had seen in years, and that was saying something. I mean, after my fling with that silver-haired, blue bodied Unicorn, i thought it was all downhill, but DAMN if I didn't find myself a looker.
*silvermane 10I did the proper thing, and walked back up to her. I tried to introduce myself, but she said she already knew my name, Pizza Pony. Bucking tabloids... I corrected her, and she introduced herself.
*silvermane 10Her name was perfect, sounding like an angel's whisper. I remember that moment perfectly, as she said- "HEY!" I jumped, looking around.
<Razyn> 11(Oh god, I was reading the logs and for a second, I thought you were posting my ship fic)
*silvermane 10I looked around the kitchen, realizing I had been staring off into space again. Man, i really need to stop doing that.
<silvermane> 10(lol silly Razyn)
<DecapKing> 4all ihave to say is
<Ivan2294> Hi
<DecapKing> 4bow chicka wow wow?
<Razyn> 11(I was like, well, okay. Let's troll Luna!)
*silvermane 10"If you keep doing that, Silver, I'm going to call you Jennifer Dillan." Such a horrible name, who would ever suggst that name for a filly? "I'm sorry, I was just thinking about something. What did you say?" I said meekly, trying not to give away my thoughts.
<MrDrProfBrony> sup
<Razyn> 0Howdy howdy howdy!
*silvermane 10She slowly wrapped her hooves around my neck, brushing my wing-tips as she did so. Sometimes, I think she does it on purpose. I looked into her eyes, as she gently tugged me, turning me. My smile was almost as wide as my spreading wings at this point.
*silvermane 10"I said 'would you take out the trash?'", as she pointed a hoof at the overflowing trash, banana peel on top as comedy requires. *
<MrDrProfBrony> hello
*silvermane 10Sighing, as my wings drooped, I turned to gather the trash. She giggled at me as I tucked my feathered wings into my side. We'd see who was laughing soon enough. She may know about the spot between my wings, but I know about her- "DAMMIT!" I yelled, as I kicked my hoof on the wall.
*silvermane 10Naturally, being the kind and gentle heart she is, this only made her laugh all the harder. Grumbling to myself, I fluttered out the door, trash hanging between my front hooves.
*silvermane 10"If you weren't so damn hot... crap, I don't have anywhere to go with that threat." I muttered under my breath, as I dropped the bag on the curb. As I turned back to the door, I stopped, ears twitching.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Herospirit, I stopped watching
<Pinkie_Pie> 13But I went a registered on their forums with the name Pinkie Pie
<Pinkie_Pie> 13It wasnt taken
<Pinkie_Pie> 13XD
<silvermane> 10(note, following scene is non-official, and is intended to be changed later on, so ignore any personal shots you may see)
*silvermane 10 Wait. I know that sound. It's so familiar. It reminded me of my days in flight academy; I'd cover my ears whenever I heard it, as it meant that somepony was about to... about to... "OH SHIT!" I shouted as I dove for cover. Or tried to.
*silvermane 10A multi-colored blur slammed into my side, sending me sprawling. Right into the trash.
*silvermane 10I looked over to see the pegasus standing proudly where I had been a moment ago. Bloody mare must be crazy, she could have killed me! What did she have to do that... for... oh crap. It's Dash.
*silvermane 10Honestly, the shocking part for me wasn't that it was Dash, or that she had found me. It was that she was a SHE.
*silvermane 10"Ra- Rainbro? Is that you?" She stood there smirking at me. "What's so funny?" i asked, as the banana peel finally slipped off my mane, landing with a plop on the wing I was lying on.
*silvermane 10Since apparently I knew who to hang out with, he- no, she burst out laughing at this. Great, at least I made two fillies laugh tonight. Someone should be, I suppose. "Wha- what are you doing here? I thought you were doing that moderator gig back in Hoofington." She looked at me funny, as if I had missed the punchline to a joke.
*silvermane 10"Really? That's what you are the most curious about? Why I'm not at work?" Shaking her now-long, colorful mane, she smiles. "Well, I suppose you never were the most direct pony, considering how you dealt with my advances back then."
*silvermane 10"Alright fine. WHAT THE BUCK HAPPENED! WHY DO YOU HAVE... WHY DID YOU... WHAT THE HAY!" I stood, freaking out at my suddenly-mare friend from school.
*silvermane 10Suddenly looking bashful, "Well, you told me you were only interested in fillies, even though I KNEW we had something... and I knew you were always popular with attractive mares, and... I guess, I just felt like it was a good idea."
*silvermane 10I stared at her for a minute. Then another. She rubbed her back hoof on the other, looking suddenly uncomfortable. Probably due to my staring. I wasn't drooling was I? That would just be horrendously awkward.
*silvermane 10She coughed, breaking my trance. Shaking my head, "Alright, alright, okay. So you're a filly now. Okay, got it. Welp, time for bed."
*silvermane 10"Wait, what? We're friends aren't we? Can't you at least talk to me? Come on, I don't expect anything to happen Silver."
*silvermane 10Sighing, "Fine, I suppose I owe that much to you. Alright." Calm, Silver, you can do this. If you can stare a roaring griffon in the face as you pick up your date... oh, right, I didn't quite manage that one. "So... um... what, uh, what brings you here, Rainbro Dash?
<silvermane> 10(wow, no comments? I'm surprised)
<DecapKing> 4( :O )
<DecapKing> 4(theres a comment)
*silvermane 10"Actually, it's Rainbow now. Something about 'Bro' just seems... off for me now. But anyways, I was actually just flying by, on my way to visit my folks."
*silvermane 10"Oh, that's... cool. So umm... how are... things? Yes, things." Smooth, Silver. At least you're not sitting in... oh right. I stand up, shaking off the garbage still matting my coat. Laughing, Dash replies "/things/ are good. Working hard, making my bits, all good."
*silvermane 10She looks up at the moon, noting its location in Luna's night. "Ah hay, I was hoping to get some more time to talk, but I guess since I only noticed you rather than planning to RUN into you, it's not meant to be." Fake sighing, she starts her take-off walk.
*silvermane 10"Alright, well, it was... nice... seeing you... again?" I said as she took off from the ground, slowly gaining altitude. "You too Silver. Say, you seeing anypony?" I would have done a spit-take if the only liquid around wasn't green and smelling of radishes from last week.
*silvermane 10Seeing my face, she laughed again. "I take that as a yes. Well you make sure she's worth you. I'd hate to have to beat up another filly for messing with my Silver-Wilver." Winking at me, she takes off. I stop, before yelling "Wait, what do you mean, another?" She just laughed as she flew off over town.
<herospirit> 15Woooow XD
*silvermane 10I muttered to myself as I walked into the house, dripping... well, I don't really want to think about that. Man, those ponies on that old show really make it look painless when pegasi crash into them. That purple filly just walked it off when that one pegasus hit her. Bucking stunt-doubles. I guess that's what I get for trying to take physics lessons from
*silvermane 10Stumbling back into the house, I find my way to the bathroom. Thank Celestia i finished repairs on the shower last month. Clambering in, I get the water running as I set my special covers over my wings.
*silvermane 10As the warm water falls over me, falling in sheets where it hits my wing covers, I grab a bottle of shampoo to get the banana-gunk out of my mane. Sometimes I hate how long I keep it, but it's hard to cut it when she uses it to... I start blushing at this thought. You know, it has been a few days... Maybe if I play my cards right, drop a few choice words.
*silvermane 10It shouldn't be too hard, I know she enjoys it too. She has that new set of bonds too, a few of them such interesting colors and textures. Yes, i do believe she would love to braid my hair if I asked nice enough.
*silvermane 10I was just about to climb out, as I heard the door creak open. Oh-hoho, maybe I don't have to ask for anything! I pulled back the screen just a bit, catching a peak of her grey coat and yellow mane. Wait. Her grey coat? Yellow mane? And was that a saddlebag? Ah horse-radish.
*silvermane 10"Please please PLEASE tell me you are just dropping off a package. Please?" I said, as I stuck my head out the curtain towards the wall-eyed mare. "The muffin has landed! For berries long gone, the juice is perfect." I just stared for a moment.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1mu_ueRfzU
*silvermane 10"You know, I wish I didn't know what that meant. I really need to lay of the studying." I climbed out of the shower, dropping my wing covers as she pulls out a package. "Wait, how did you get in here?" She looked at me blankly. "The robin feasting on the worm knows the rabbits den best."
*silvermane 10 My head twitched painfully as I tried to make sense of what she said. I heard giggling from the other room. It sounded... oddly foalish, to be honest. "Derpy, you didn't bring Dinky with you, did you?"
<silvermane> 10(i'm glad no one STILL gets the massive innuendo in the prior lines)
<DecapKing> 4(i figured it out somewhat)
*silvermane 10"The muffin baked fresh is best kept away from pigeons. Best to spread butter first!" Was all she replied, as she wandered back out. I really need to get a lock on that bathroom door. "Umm, alright. Thanks Derpy. Oh, wait, is this your new book? I'm still working on the last one." She smiled at me as she flitted out the front door, carrying a giggling foa
<silvermane> 10(do you know what it meant?
*silvermane 10"The muffin baked fresh is best kept away from pigeons. Best to spread butter first!" Was all she replied, as she wandered back out. I really need to get a lock on that bathroom door. "Umm, alright. Thanks Derpy. Oh, wait, is this your new book? I'm still working on the last one."
<DecapKing> 4(i have a couple of ideas)
*silvermane 10She smiled at me as she flitted out the front door, carrying a giggling foal in her hooves. I hope she used the handle to get in.
*silvermane 10Muttering again, I wander out to the living room. I lay on the couch, stretching my wings to check my feathers. Nope, none missing or bent, which is good. they don't grow back, at least not without some very expensive medicine. Sometimes I wish she'd understand that, as she tends to tug on my wings a bit TOO rough, although it's probably my fault.
*silvermane 10I suppose the fact that all of my mental faculties fail when she plays with my feathers doesn't help. Apparently my face gets very cute when she rubs that spot on my spine. Not that I'd know. I mean, I don't stand in the bathroom looking at the mirror to try it out or anything. Of course not. Heh. hehe. Wait, why am I defending myself in my own thoughts?
<silvermane> 10(basically, Derpy said that Silver's girlfriend let her in.)
*MrDrProfBrony wants pie
<DecapKing> 4(i figured something like that, or she was stalking him)
<Pinkie_Pie> 13"Woooow"
*silvermane 10This part breaks me from my silent reverie, just in time to catch a wonderful sight. Two words float through my mind, words of such legend and power that all who know them turn to see what they are directed at. "Dat flank" Ah horse-apples, I said it out loud. Again.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13That sounded to much like my friend Aaron Stuber..
<Pinkie_Pie> 13=.=
*silvermane 10She turns around, hoof on hips, as she regards me. "I sure hope you were talking to me, as it'd be just plain weird if you were referring to yourself." I look at her blankly before realizing I was looking over my own side at her.
*silvermane 10Glancing back at her, "Oh yeah, yeah, umm, your flank too. Damn, so hot. Yes." I roll my eyes as I use my wings to flip off the couch. I follow her up the stairs, *accidentally* bumping into her side with my own.
*silvermane 10 I try to pick her up onto my back, like I did on our first date. She screamed so loud that time, laughing and yelling at me to put her down. There was something about that night... what was it. As I noticed my trembling knees, it came back to me. "Oh crap." I collapsed under her weight. Fortunately, I had my wings tucked in.
<MirthTinker> 13(just came back and scrolled up, that Trixie encounter is still a good idea :P)
<silvermane> 10(hehe, after i finish retelling SM x ? )
*silvermane 10She starts laughing as she rolls off of me, leaving the bunnies to dance in peace. I wonder why that pink one isn't sharing her jam. That isn't nice, what if the ducky over there is hungry? She should really learn to share, like that one mare taught us. What was with her sweater anyways? Mrs. Shy was such an awesome show...
<silvermane> 10(that was a Mr. Rogers reference, for those who know of him)
*silvermane 10Shaking my head, I looked up at my filly. Her laughter was ringing in my ears, and her smile was spread wide. From this angle, her gown was just so... oh my, why is her mark so attractive? And why is she laughing harder now? And why can't I balance right? I looked at my back, noticing I had a small, or, well, BIG problem.
*silvermane 10"What the hay is that orange thing on my back?" I groan out, as the, ehem, LOVE OF MY ACCURSED LIFE continues to laugh at my misery. Suddenly a high-pitched drone starts coming out of the thing.
*silvermane 10"Scootaloo, dear, please get off of Silver. He's had a rough day" my filly manages to choke out, between laughs. I realize that there is now something stuck around my wing-joints as the orange filly flops to the ground.
<MirthTinker> 13(I wouldn't laugh at you...that hard)
*silvermane 10"Sorry, I didn't hurt him did I? I was just bored and i found this cool thing and I thought it would look so handsome on him and I was hoping he'd wear it to our wedding when Silver marries me and then we can go live in Canterlot with Celestia and Luna and Midnight and Moon Runner and..." it seemed to continue for several minutes.

<Steven_Magnet> {1,0You0,4Tube}: "Rainbow Dash Road" - "Extended version here: http://dexterford.bandcamp.com/ Some epic racing music for the forthcoming Pony Kart racing game. Gotta love that title. Neither the i..."
*silvermane 10I'm sure it didn't quite last that long, as she didn't stop for breath. Maybe she can absorb oxygen through osmosis? Wait, how the hay did she get in here? Why is everypony running into me today?
*silvermane 10Deciding on the logical choice, I stood up to face the orange little bird-brained foal. She stopped talking for just a moment as she saw the look on my face. As I grabbed her by the scruff of the neck in my mouth, she started blabbering again. "Wait, don't we have to get married first? I thoguht you had to kiss me first and then we have kids and smrf-rlf"
*silvermane 10I stuffed a pillow in her mouth and bodily tossed her through a window. Fortunately, (I guess), it was open.
*silvermane 10"If I wasn't interested after travelling to the future when you were a mare, WHY THE HAY WOULD I WANT YOU NOW!?!?" I shout after her. Naturally, my DEAR LOVE is laughing her flank off at this point.
*silvermane 10I clambered up the stairs, grumbling about the weirdos in this town. I swear, when I finish my degree, I'm going to write a book about the nut-jobs down in this town. I'll dedicate a whole chapter to pizzas, and I'll call it 'Pizza Ponies Paranoia, and Other Ailments'
*silvermane 10I knocked an egg off the banister to the floor below, fortunately landing on a soft chair. Wait, an egg? What the... no, nevermind. I don't care. Bed time. Eeyup, that sounds nice. My dear mare was following close behind, although I had long since stopped caring.
*silvermane 10"Oh come on Silver, what's the matter?" She put on her best pout, trying to make me laugh. Well I wasn't going to hear it. I looked away, keeping full control of my face. No reaction, just calm cool. Sadly, that's all I kept controlled.
*silvermane 10"What, planning to fly to Canterlot tonight? Hot date waiting for you up in Cloudsdale?" Ah hay, why can I never keep my Luna-damned wings under control around her? Suddenly looking a bit more sombre, she brushes against me, placing herself under my wing.
*silvermane 10"Come on, I know something that will cheer you up." She whispered into my ear, as she started dragging me by the hoof towards the bedroom. Fortunately I was in the right mind enough to close my wings as we went through. Don't need to make that mistake again. Today. Man I'm sore.
*silvermane 10 I found myself standing before the matress, the pillow looking like the sexiest thing in the world. I lifted my gaze to my mare. Okay, maybe the second sexiest. With a knowing look, she unceremoniously shoved me onto the matress.
*silvermane 10She clambered right on top of me, giving me a soft, sweet kiss on the lips, her hooves tracing a path along the edge of my wings. Silver lighting streaked down my spine, mixing with the sweet taste in my mouth.
*silvermane 10As I lay there wondering how lightning could mix with a taste, starting to consider a study on synesthesia, when I noticed the odd weight on my chest. Oh right. I wrapped my hooves around my mare, kissing her back, although it got kind of hard to focus as she worked one hoof under my back to the joint between my wings.
*silvermane 10As usual, my entire body went rigid before I remembered to relax, and I loosned up beneath her as she worked at my wings. I rolled slightly to the side, trying to say something through her mouth. Apparently she didn't get the message.
*silvermane 10My wing was so itchy, so i tried to kick the two mice boxing off of it before they pulled out any feathers. Somehow I didn't notice that my legs can't reach my back, but they seemed to get the picture. One of them let out a very loud 'Hey!' in a strangly familiar voice.
*silvermane 10One of the mice started nudging me in the back really hard. Strange, it seems awfully strong for such a little guy. I was really impressed by it as I landed with a thump on the ground. "What the buck were you doing Silver? First you fall asleep on me, then you kick me in the shin? Be thankful I did your hair up before I went to sleep!"
*silvermane 10She rolled back over, grumbling. I looked at her, love of my life, dearest thing in my life. Horse-apples, I've done it this time.
<Zephirdd> what
<Zephirdd> pony kart racing game?
<silvermane> 10(please, hold your laughter...)
<Zephirdd> ohhh boy my afternoons
*silvermane 10Maybe I can get her flowers, or a cake from that one shop. I think that one where the pink pony used to work is still open. Surprising, honestly, considering the *accident* that happened there. They never did say how many went blind that night.
*silvermane 10 Yeah, that sounds like a great plan. I'll get a big sheet cake, with candied hearts all around it. The frosting will be the same color as her coat, and the edges the same as her mane. On it, i'll put in big letter, 'I love you, my dear- wait, what's wrong with my mane?
*silvermane 10OH FOR CELESTIAS SAKE! She gave me pigtails again.
<silvermane> 10~FIN~

<Zephirdd> if it is any similar to mario kart, which I assume it is
<DecapKing> 4ftw
<Luna> 07,1 nicely written though, gotta hand it to you
<Zephirdd> its going to be my entertainment
<Zephirdd> along with dota2 and diablo3
<DecapKing> 4eeeyup
<silvermane> 10hehe, i wrote it a few months ago before a live audience
<silvermane> 10i tell ya, that's quite a thing to do.
<silvermane> 10the reactions to the RainbroDash gender-bender scene were priceless
<Nittany_Tiger> Fair warning: Diablo 3 will require a constant internet connection to play single-player.
<Zephirdd> I know
<Zephirdd> not like it matter for me imo
*silvermane 10wraps his hoof around MirthTinker. "I wonder who will finally be that mare in the story. Hmm, owell, find out eventually i guess."
<Zephirdd> I already organized a group for loot farming at my class
<Nittany_Tiger> I really hate games that require constant internet connections for SP gaming.
<Zephirdd> so we sell it for money :P
<Nittany_Tiger> It's the most retarded idea in video game history.
<Zephirdd> I dont think I'll play SP that much
<DecapKing> 4g2g
<silvermane> 10so did you guys enjoy it?
<silvermane> 10later DecapKing
<Zephirdd> well, it has a reason, I mean, if its online they can track hacks
<Zephirdd> so you won't sell hacked items
<Zephirdd> >_>
<MirthTinker> 13yeah, I enjoyed it (the parts I was here for)
<Nittany_Tiger> What about those that will never play online?
<MirthTinker> 13hehe, it's soooo not me there, I'm demure...and sophisticated
<Zephirdd> but yeah, kinda sucks that there is no possibility for a non-online play
<Nittany_Tiger> What about internet hiccups?
<MirthTinker> 13also, not enough teddy bots...yeah
<Zephirdd> like, playing offline without the possibility of interchanging items with online play
<MirthTinker> 13afk for a bit :P
<silvermane> 10okay Tinkerbelle.
<Nittany_Tiger> Blizzard could easily separate offline and online play characters, but they don't want to.
<silvermane> 10you know, my tail reminds me of Minxes... i'm glad i got to play a foxman
<Zephirdd> yeah
<Zephirdd> :\
<Zephirdd> that does suck

<silvermane> I LOVE THAT LINK SO MUCH I WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH IT
<Sumica> Like that show do you silvermane ?
<silvermane> it's not that, although i do like YuYu
<silvermane> it's the sheer number of animes in the complete section i saw
<silvermane> maybe i'm a little giddy
<silvermane> i've had a good week
<silvermane> very good week
<Sumica> So you like anime eh?
<silvermane> i like to think i like anime

<DecapKing> nothing
<DecapKing> just saying that
<silvermane> 10oh... ok
<Zephirdd> woah
<Zephirdd> that game
<Zephirdd> is surprisingly hard
<Zephirdd> D:>
<Zephirdd> or I just suck at it on a keyboard

<silvermane> 10night DecapKing, Dashite, DeniedExistenceMobile, GGgala, Prince-Dari, Razyn
<silvermane> i'm out, night everypony
<FreezeFrame> Hmmm... fimfic was giving me a bit of a problem loading for a bit.
<Zephirdd> night silvermane
*Zephirdd hugs silvermane
<Zephirdd> :d
<FreezeFrame> I was trying to read Pretty in Pink
<Sumica> Eh, what game?
<Zephirdd> Starfox 64
<Zephirdd> .-.
<DecapKing> whatd i miss?
<Zephirdd> its horrible to control that ship using the keyboard
<FreezeFrame> Zephirdd: Yeah
<FreezeFrame> I'd suggest buying it on VC if you have a Wii, or if you have a 3DS getting it for that.
<Zephirdd> I dont have either
<Zephirdd> .-.
<Zephirdd> heh
<Zephirdd> I don't have any consoles
<FreezeFrame> Oh, god
<Zephirdd> the last console I had
<FreezeFrame> When I read the end with the little descriptions of what Pinkie was going through.....
<Zephirdd> was SNES
<Zephirdd> that pinkie pie fic?
<Zephirdd> =p
<FreezeFrame> Yes, Pretty in Pink
<FreezeFrame> I normally tear up at sadfics like that.
<Zephirdd> I usually avoid sad fics
<Zephirdd> >.>'
<FreezeFrame> But this one hit especially close to home because of what the symptoms sounded like at the end.
<FreezeFrame> Since my grandfather is dying the slow death of Parkinson's right now.
<Zephirdd> symptoms?
<Zephirdd> oh boy
<Zephirdd> that is one fic I'll totally avoid now
<Zephirdd> Ever since I saw a comic about pinkie having diabets I've been hating these diseases t_t
<FreezeFrame> Zephirdd: It's really heartwarming
<FreezeFrame> I really suggest you read it.
<Zephirdd> wait
<Zephirdd> is it good or bad?!
<FreezeFrame> It's good.
<FreezeFrame> Pretty in Pink
<FreezeFrame> It's not like Bittersweet.
<Zephirdd> you see, I have barely read any fics
<Zephirdd> let me see... I think I read 5 or 6 up till today
<Zephirdd> :P
<Zephirdd> A world without Rainbows, one about Trixie being Twilight's sister, Past Sins(AWESOME), My Little Alicorn, Substitute Harmony and the one where Celestia writes a letter to Blueblood while high on doughnuts
<Zephirdd> Oh, and Cupcakes
<Zephirdd> so it's 7
<FreezeFrame> I won't touch Cupcakes
<Zephirdd> Well, the thing is disgusting and all
<Zephirdd> but after a few weeks, when you think about it, the writer is really fucking good
<FreezeFrame> I like sadfics, I don't mind some grimdark
<Zephirdd> He really achieves the objective and does it in a magnific way
<FreezeFrame> (Sunset was brilliant)
<Zephirdd> what was Sunset about?
<FreezeFrame> Twilight discovers a dark secret about herself, and the fallout of it.
<Zephirdd> sounds interesting
<FreezeFrame> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/05/story-sunset.html
<Razyn> 11Hey Dashite
<Dashite> How...
<Razyn> 11Muhaha
<Dashite> I literally just opened up this window...
<Zephirdd> *checks art*
*Razyn 11twirls mustache
<Zephirdd> WTF ALICORN TWILIGHT
<Razyn> 11So, how were you lurking if you just opened the window?
<Zephirdd> idk, I *really* tend to avoid grimdark ever since cupcakes
<Zephirdd> but oh well, can't be worse than that
<Zephirdd> =p
*Razyn 11pokes Boombox
<Boombox> ENTERING SLEEP MODE
<Boombox> ...*
<Dashite> I had silvershipper minimized so I could watch bronystate. Was in the middle of playing L4D2. Just got back.
<Razyn> 11And what's your excuse, prince-dari?
<Razyn> 11(mfw I pull it off twice in a row)
<Dashite> It doesn't count for him because when you go dari
<Dashite> dari
<Zephirdd> Well, I'm sleepy
<Dashite> dari
<Zephirdd> g2g
<Dashite> dari
<Dashite> dari
<Dashite> dari
*Zephirdd hugs #bronystate
<Zephirdd> 'night 'night
<Razyn> 11You never go Hipster?
<Dashite> It goes ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding on his end. :p
<Razyn> 11I love staying up late. My sleep addled mind processes bad jokes as being funny.
<Dashite> :p
<Razyn> 0Toonami...
<Razyn> 11New Toonami pony intro.
<Razyn> 11Now I has a sad
<Dashite> I'd have to stay up past when people start getting up in the morning to get that...
<Razyn> 0I miss Toonami so much.
<MeteorVenture> why's that? i mean i hear people say that from time to time and i watched some stuff on toonami as well but i didn't feel a particular attachment to the station
<Natleyn> http://www.toonamiaftermath.com/?
<Razyn> 11Have you ever messed with those dreams? You know the kind where you train yourself before hand to be able to control them?
<Natleyn> ... without the question mark.
<Dashite> I don't get those.
<Razyn> 11I mean have you ever tried making them.
<Dashite> I get recurring ones so it's kinda like I've read the strategy guide before going through them.
<Razyn> 0Natleyn is that what I think it is?
<Dashite> I've never tried actively messing with a dream. My dreams are awesome enough as they are.
<Razyn> 11Well aren't you lucky.
<Natleyn> 24/7 Toonami.
<Natleyn> Well, a few other things, but mostly Toonami.
<Razyn> 11I never really cared much, but the thought of hanging out in ponyville during my nocturnal emissions... (don't even know what that really means) That's a prospect I would work toward.
<Dashite> Damn right. My dreams involve being chased by 80 foot T-rexes through my elementary school, ambushing tank convoys in my neighbourhood and flying using t-shirts.
<Razyn> 0I now and instantly love you forever.
<Razyn> 0*permanently not instant
<Razyn> 0Sleep deprivation
<Razyn> 0And there's digimon. By Celestia's beard, there is Digimon.
*Natleyn hugs Razyn
*Razyn 0hugs Natleyn back
<Razyn> 0Goodnight, my new friend!
<Razyn> 0And everypony else who is still here!
<MeteorVenture> take care razyn!
<Natleyn> Nighty night! :3
<Razyn> 11Goodnight, Dashite. And GGGala.
<FreezeFrame> ugh, they're playing Home Movies right now
<Dashite> Night.
<MeteorVenture> for a minute there i read that as home alone movies
<MeteorVenture> i wasn't sure why that was a totally bad thing
<Polarfire> >_>
<Polarfire> I dun believe it.
<Polarfire> :DDDDDDDDD
<FreezeFrame> Okay, sleep time.
<Polarfire> chat, dead you why so?
<Polarfire> guys
<Polarfire> We have 9 rooms that contain nobody but us.
<Polarfire> Don't you think that is overkill :P
<FreezeFrame> It's after 11:30 on the west coast, that's why.
<Dashite> East coast.
<Polarfire> eh. Chat's usually active at this time.
<Choco_Taco> What's today's topic?
<Polarfire> ponies.
<Choco_Taco> I wish I had a monocle now....
<Dashite> Ponies. Ponies everywhere.
<Dashite> Why is it always ponies with you people?
<FreezeFrame> er, yeah
<FreezeFrame> I'm bad at geography, apparently
<FreezeFrame> anyway, sleep, for reals
<FreezeFrame> Dashite: YOu missed the religion conversation
<Polarfire> pfft. Sleep is for the weak.
<Dashite> I miss lots of conversations...
<FreezeFrame> No, sleep is for the week
<Polarfire> I'll sleep when I'm dead.
<Choco_Taco> I sleep when I blink
<FreezeFrame> I would stay up if I didn't have stuff literally all day tomorrow
<Polarfire> school?
<FreezeFrame> I have class from 8-11, an interview right after, doing stuff outside the dorm until 1 because we won't have water (plumbing's getting fixed), audition for the play at 4, fantasy football draft at 5:45, and non-denominational service at 8
<FreezeFrame> And I have to swing by the registrar's office as well as get in touch with a professor at my old school somewhere in that mess.
<Choco_Taco> Huge load.....small plate
<FreezeFrame> Tuesday isn't normally that busy
<FreezeFrame> I also have to go bug the bookstore
<Choco_Taco> pretty much a rare cluster?
<Polarfire> I just have school.
<FreezeFrame> Yup
<FreezeFrame> I only have 13 credit hours this semester (and next semester)
<Dashite> Huh, I'm going to have 14 hours of classes.
<Dashite> Although that's only lectures...
<Dashite> Only 9-11 hours next semester though.
<FreezeFrame> Well, I only need 53 more to graduate, and being on track means I'm done May 2013
<FreezeFrame> Since I have to do yearly internships at this school for 3 academic credit hours apiece, I only have to take 47 more credit hours of courses.
<Dashite> I need 3.0 credits. If I applied to overload I could get that all in this semester, but they don't offer all the classes I want this semester.
<FreezeFrame> Of course, I also need to stay full time, as it's not a commutable distance from my house, and campus living is reserved for full-time students (full time is 12 Credit Hours)
<Dashite> My school isn't fond of internships. :/
<Dashite> Full time is 3.5 credits over a full year.
<Marzai> Your school has problems then.
<FreezeFrame> Conceivably, if I were to add one-to-two more classes per semester, I could be done fall of 2012
<FreezeFrame> But nah
<Dashite> My school does have problems. Too many professors from when it opened that are still there.
<Marzai> Yeah, but those classes would have to be like...taking the prerequisite class and the advanced class at the same time, right?
<Marzai> And...depending on the professors...that could be spot on and awesome, or downright painful.
<Marzai> If we're on the same train of tought.
<Marzai> thought*
<FreezeFrame> Dashite: That's a weird counting system
<FreezeFrame> What country are you in?
<Dashite> Canada.
<Marzai> Canadia.
<Marzai> :D
<FreezeFrame> Ah, yeah. Canucks always gotta do things weird.
<FreezeFrame> With your ehs and aboots
<Marzai> Oh, crap.
<Marzai> I just thought of something.
<FreezeFrame> :D
<Dashite> Bachelor's is 20 credits. 5 credits per year. 2.5 credits per semester. 0.5 credits per class.
<FreezeFrame> Bachelors is 120 credit hours
<Marzai> My Little Pony: Majora's Mask
<Marzai> And Luna get a hold of it.
<Dashite> Yeah, we don't measure things in credit hours.
<FreezeFrame> Credit hours are determined by the amount of time you spend in the class, essentially. Most are 3, as it's either MWF, 1 hour per day for the whole semester, or TTh, 1.5 hours a day
<FreezeFrame> But stuff like PE is 1 CH, since you spend 1 hour in class a week for the semester, or 2 hours per week for half a semester.
<Marzai> That sounds about right.
<Dashite> Our classes aren't set up like that.
<Marzai> Because we're U.S., and you are Canadia. Regional differences will lead to...well, differences.
<FreezeFrame> And then there's lab sciences, where you get a lab as well as lecture for 4 CH, or just Calculus, which is 4 CH due to needing 4 hours per week for the course
<Marzai> College is college.
<Dashite> Classes vary between 2 and 4 hours for lecture. Some will have associated seminar or lab times as well.
<FreezeFrame> (When I took my Calc sequence it was MWThF or MTWF
<Dashite> Very rarely will you have a class that is spread over more than 2 days.
<FreezeFrame> Except calc III, which I took at night, and was TTh, 2 hours each day.
<FreezeFrame> So you get a single class in a day?
<Dashite> Sometimes.
<Dashite> For example, I have Project Management. 3 hours of class per week. 7-10 on mondays.
<FreezeFrame> I have, as an example, Real Analysis, 3 hours per week, 9-10 Monday, Wednesday, Friday
<FreezeFrame> And Stats, 3 hours per week, 9:30 - 11 Tuesday, Thursday
<Marzai> Sounds similar to my Survey of American Literature, 3 hour class, from 6-9pm on Thurday nights.
<Dashite> On the other hand, next semester I have Web Application Development which is 4 hours per week. 4-6 Monday, 5-7 Wednesday.
<FreezeFrame> But yeah, I need to sleep so I have time for breakfast before class
<FreezeFrame> Because I hate being rushed for breakfast.
<Marzai> I think I'm off tomorrow.
<Marzai> Labor day.
<FreezeFrame> I need to have, bare minimum, 45 minutes to eat and enjoy my breakfast
<FreezeFrame> That was today here
<Dashite> Yeah
<FreezeFrame> College students don't generally get it off.
<FreezeFrame> You guys don't have Labor Day, you have Labour Day :P
<Marzai> Well, Labor day fot the Tuesday/Thursday classes.
<Dashite> :p
<Dashite> Class doesn't start till the 8th this year.
<Marzai> <_<
<FreezeFrame> (I actually like some Queen's English spellings, like grey and defence)
<FreezeFrame> Maneovres is just plain weird, though.
<Marzai> Maneuvers?
<FreezeFrame> It's got a weird spelling in Britain
<Marzai> Aha.
<Dashite> manoeuvre
<FreezeFrame> Yeah
<Dashite> And you actually eat breakfast? :O
<Dashite> It's been so long since I've done that...
<Marzai> Welcome to the world of the quick.
<Marzai> Where you just can't take a break, and there's not enough hours in the day to do anything worthwhile.
<FreezeFrame> There's also the whole Aluminum vs. Aluminium thing
<Dashite> I generally take the extra sleep time over breakfast.
*FreezeFrame prefers the US version because it's one syllable less
<Marzai> Aluminium*
<FreezeFrame> Dashite: I'm grumpier hungry than sleepy
<Marzai> ?*
<FreezeFrame> Marzai: In the US, it's Aluminum
<Marzai> I know that. I'm a U.S. kid
<Marzai> :D
<FreezeFrame> Anyway, I need my 6 hours of sleep
<FreezeFrame> Since I can't shower after class but before my interview.
<Dashite> I'd need to wake up too early if I wanted to eat breakfast.
<Dashite> I need at least 90 minutes of awake time before I can eat anything.
<FreezeFrame> I can get up at 6:30, shower, dress, and head to the dining hall
<FreezeFrame> As long as I don't start reading any ponyfics.... >.>
<Dashite> :p
<Dashite> Oh hey, have you heard of this one that I've been reading? Fallout: Equestria...
<FreezeFrame> :P
<FreezeFrame> Speaking of, I love the current EqD banner
<Marzai> I've been reading Corona Blaze and Past Sins.
<GGgala> lawl
*GGgala just got back in
<GGgala> >dari is op registered to ChanServ now
<GGgala> lolwut
*GGgala pokes Polarfire
<Polarfire> >_>
<GGgala> ha, at least we both disappeared and reappeared at about the same time, this time XD
<Polarfire> XDDD
<Polarfire> We're getting better.
<GGgala> soon we will be synchronized
<Polarfire> lawl.
<Polarfire> heh. 9 rooms that only have me, you, and Dari XD
<GGgala> SOOOO I'm sure you may have noticed the raep backlog on your return >_>
<GGgala> and eeyup!
<Polarfire> um. yes. That was...
<Polarfire> wow.
<GGgala> you said you two started up a #lol chat to get away from me? :P
<GGgala> and yeah, it certainly was... something
<GGgala> wait.. dun believe what? i missed something :D-worthy?
<GGgala> lol, we're even all in #1 and #VioletShelter now? XD
<Polarfire> no, I joined the room and only Dari was in there... Not sure how it was created.
<Polarfire> and eeyup. 9 rooms. 9.
<Polarfire> check out Dari's whois
<Polarfire> <3
<GGgala> that's as many as almost a whole ten. and that's terrible.
<Polarfire> XDDD
<GGgala> Oh Super-Dictionary, you always bring the lulz
<Polarfire> >_>
<GGgala> wait... leave for a sec? i wanna try /invite
<Polarfire> ok
<GGgala> woo, /invite for non-ops
<GGgala> badass
<Polarfire> :D
<GGgala> sadly invisible, though. weird privacy feature?
<GGgala> also, I love #something! #something! is my favorite.
<Polarfire> ... why do we have 10 channels that all of us are in again? :P
<GGgala> i dunno, but we also have three that aren't just us, for a total of 13 XD
<Polarfire> I have 15 >_>
<GGgala> hmm... dari is afk?
<GGgala> dari's in 15 >_>
<GGgala> but two of them are mod channels
<Polarfire> yeah. Dari's probably sleeping <3
<GGgala> aww, but dari never sleeps at a reasonable hour!
<GGgala> it's only 5:30am there!
<GGgala> not even bright out, i bet.
<Polarfire> heh. he may have just been tired out.
<GGgala> heh. well, those in glass houses shouldn't throw stones, so i won't :3
<Polarfire> eh?
<GGgala> (i tire out unexpectedly too, remember? XD)
<Polarfire> oh.
<Polarfire> I am a little sleepy today. but I have homework.
<Polarfire> I might just get up early tomorrow and do it.
<GGgala> ah. you staying here for now though?
<Polarfire> possibly. Its almost midnight... I should probably get up at 6 for my homework. So maybe 12:30?
<GGgala> okay that gives us an hour :D
<Polarfire> :D
<Polarfire> if only mai waifu was here also
<GGgala> yeah, i was hoping he'd be too
<Polarfire> also, yfw bronystate will be switching networks again soon
<GGgala> private ownership not all it's cracked up to be?
<GGgala> also, MFW #BronyState is actually quiet so early
<Polarfire> I think they want commercial reliability before season 2 starts.
<Polarfire> and yeah. it was completely dead when I came in at 10:30, and hasn't moved much since.
<GGgala> yeah. this is not very reliable if ChanServ and NickServ go down every time some admin has to reboot
<Polarfire> now its dead again.
<GGgala> and netsplits everyone
<GGgala> weird. streamers must be busy.
<Polarfire> Someone is buying commercial servers/space soon. They are switching to that.
<GGgala> ooh, so still running their own, just not running from their homes.
<GGgala> bene
<Polarfire> hmm
<Polarfire> actually I don't think its a mod that's doing it.
<Polarfire> It's someone independent that is making an irc network just for bronies.
<GGgala> eh?
<GGgala> ohh
<GGgala> i dunno, GeekShed seems like it should be sufficient?
<GGgala> what would be the diff, you think?
<Polarfire> The new network will be just for bronies.
<GGgala> i like the idea of being a hop skip and a jump away from #Brony, #EquestriaDaily, #EquestrianStudy, #EquestriaAfterDark, #SteamyPoniesOOC , etc... but then they might be migrating to the new BronyNet IRC network, mightn't they?
<GGgala> i meant practically speaking. not sure what the benefit is...
<Polarfire> possibly. I don't know how big they plan on making the network. Also I don't chat on any of those :P
<GGgala> lol, i just lurk. a lot.
<Polarfire> heh. anything interesting happen?
<GGgala> most i ever talked was get into a silly argument with the mod of #EquestrianStudy when he wall "LE SIGH WHY DO PEOPLE WRITE GRIMDARK OH WOE"
<GGgala> "PONIES ARE ESCAPISM AND FUN ETC"
<GGgala> ...wall = was all. though that seems like a good merged word.
<GGgala> ...neologism. but not quite new. >_>
<Polarfire> heh.
<GGgala> i'm a mutual semi-lurker with a brony i met IRL there too XD
<Polarfire> XD
<GGgala> he used to be a permalurker at #BronyState too, which is where i recognized the name from when i saw his screenname on the list
<GGgala> we lost him when he moved to college a few weeks back
<Polarfire> D:
<Polarfire> who was he?
<GGgala> Elision
<Polarfire> I remember him.
<GGgala> he actually DID talk, sometime in early-mid August.
<Polarfire> didn't talk much.
<Polarfire> at all.
<Polarfire> oh.
<GGgala> just jumped into a convo
<Polarfire> heh.
<GGgala> he's cool
<GGgala> (the talking was a shock to me, too)
<Polarfire> oh. cool
<Polarfire> heh
<Sumica> Kinda sad when it's so dead in here.

<Barry> Hi
<AllisZero> Morning everypony
<Synros> ello
<AllisZero> 75 minutes of bloopers?
<AllisZero> Nah, not gonna go through that while at work
<Synros> ?
<AllisZero> Bloopers were posted in EQD
<AllisZero> Gotta say, it takes a very keen eye to spot those differences
<Synros> could you link em plz?
<Synros> oops
<AllisZero> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/09/season-1-bloopers.html
<AllisZero> Yup
<Synros> thank you
<Synros> lol love that hoof coming out of Twilights head.
<AllisZero> Lol yeah
<Synros> there are some funny things in here
<Dermathil> Alright guys, cyall in about six hours.
<Dermathil> BYE
<Barry> The image didn't load
<prince-dari> So open the link.
<prince-dari> God mibbit makes you guys so lazy.
<prince-dari> :P
<Barry> There's no link
<prince-dari> Click the picture.
<Barry> It's not there!
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> Crappy mibbit.
<Barry> It appeared for a second then vanished
<prince-dari> MFW the image opens fine.
<prince-dari> I just opened up a mibbit tab.
<Barry> lol, nice
<RobotPinkie> wow... yeah that blooper video got annoying quickly
<RobotPinkie> maybe someday we get something official
<Barry> it's just the music and the near constant 1-up sfx
<RobotPinkie> i kinda thought it would actually be bloopers, too, not animation misses and things that weren't defined properly in the show bible.
<Barry> Well, isn't that just one kind of blooper?
<RobotPinkie> i guess that's true, lol
<Barry> It's a lot harder to get a true blooper reel in animated series.
<Barry> 9 times out of 10, it's kind of forced
<RobotPinkie> well, i mean it is then either forced or it's something that happens during voice recording
<prince-dari> >see this on Skype
<prince-dari> Lulz
<RobotPinkie> lol
<RobotPinkie> I want to believe, dari
<Iks> screamers is a fun movie
<KShrike> :(
<KShrike> You know.
<KShrike> Rain sucks
*Retsamoreh slaps KShrike
<Retsamoreh> RAIN IS AWESOME
<HotCocoa> So yeah
<HotCocoa> Now I remember why I don't use Lion.
*KShrike shoots Retsamoreh an angry look
<Iks> it depends on the amount of rain
<Retsamoreh> I am Thundercloud Storm, AND THE RAIN. WILL LAST. FOREVVVVVVVVER.
<HotCocoa> Sketchy_Sounds: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11170731/Screen%20Shot%202011-09-06%20at%2012.34.33%20AM.png
<Iks> haha.... dash board
<prince-dari> Lawl Iks, I thought the same thing.
<prince-dari> Dash board is best board.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Awesome
<HotCocoa> Yeah I pony-fied Lion, but then I remembered that it's an absolutely useless operating system.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Pony desktops
<HotCocoa> If I could have that kind of desktop layout in Snow Leopard, I'd be cool with that.
<bicyclerepairman> doesn't 10.6 support multiple desktops too?
<Nashy> Mac, humbug
<Nashy> PC ponies
<HotCocoa> Yes, but there's no desktop preview in Snow
<prince-dari> Eugh Macs. :P
<bicyclerepairman> ah yeah, you're right
<HotCocoa> Just FYI, there's nothing you can do on a PC that I can't do on a Mac. And that includes right-clicking.
<HotCocoa> Also
<prince-dari> Anyway, back to lurking.
<HotCocoa> There's nothing you can do on a Mac that I can't do in Linux, BSD, Windows, Plan 9, System 7, System 9 or any other operating system on the planet.
<HotCocoa> OS wars are a completely useless waste of time.
<Sketchy_Sounds> So guys
<Nashy> How about... play computer games?
<Sketchy_Sounds> I'm gonna start streaming in a sec, if anyone fancies hearing me singing some songs.
<Nashy> Haha.
<HotCocoa> Nashy: Wine.
<Nashy> Yeah, have fun with that...
<HotCocoa> Or VirtualBox.
<HotCocoa> Or VMWare
<HotCocoa> Or Parallels
<HotCocoa> Or Xen
<Why> Hello!
<HotCocoa> Why hello, Why!
<Nashy> If all operating systems are equal, why not pick one that's easiest to play games on?
<bicyclerepairman> why, he—
<bicyclerepairman> you beat me to it, HotCocoa… :-/
<Sketchy_Sounds> http://www.ustream.tv/channel/songcasts Gonna start in a short while.
<Nashy> Unless you're some sort of masochist who likes messing with emulators ;G
<bicyclerepairman> because some people don't want to play games?
<HotCocoa> Nashy: I never said all OS's were equal, I just said OS wars are pointless because there's nothing that can't be done on any OS. That doesn't mean it doesn't take effort, and that all OS's have their strengths and weaknesses.
<KShrike> Wow... I keep logging in, and then get caught up with work so I don't actually talk in the chat.
<KShrike> lol
<KShrike> Sorry, guys
<KShrike> Catch you later, I got class.
<HotCocoa> Sketchy_Sounds: STOP DOING IT WHILE I'M AT WORK.
<Nashy> Ah, fair enough.
<prince-dari> >someone asks me to guess what wine stands for
<HotCocoa> l8r KShrike
<prince-dari> >say windows emulator
<Sketchy_Sounds> trololol
<prince-dari> >told it stands for wine is not an emulator
<HotCocoa> prince-dari: confusing, ain't it? :D
<HotCocoa> Just like LAME = LAME Ain't an MP3 Encoder
<prince-dari> And there I thought my deduction skills were awesome.
<Nashy> I hate recursive acronyms.
<prince-dari> The developers were clearly one step ahead of me. XD
<HotCocoa> I'm So Meta, Even This Acronym
<Nashy> The developers clearly suck at naming.
<HotCocoa> Developers do suck at naming
<prince-dari> "Comgenie's awesome file manager"
<prince-dari> I tend to agree.
<prince-dari> :P
<HotCocoa> We have one operating system named after big cats, another one named after characters from Toy Story
<bicyclerepairman> well, have you looked at variable names?
<HotCocoa> beOS FTW
<Shaico> ...
<Shaico> This was a triumph.
<HotCocoa> !!!
<prince-dari> Lots of idlers in this channel.
<Iks> better that way
<Iks> when 80 people are talking no one can follow the chat
<prince-dari> Turbo chat with 300+ people is just...
<prince-dari> >_>
<prince-dari> >play Pinkie quest with 300+ in chat
<prince-dari> >Toot spam destroys server
<prince-dari> XD
<prince-dari> BRB

<PsychicKid> grilled cheese and ravioli
<PsychicKid> come at me bro
<RobotPinkie> lolwat?
<DeadPool> People....
<DeadPool> i have something...
<DeadPool> which might bring nostalgia back >:O
<DeadPool> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAURaLmgMWo
<NarkeyPunk> Hi
<Nashy> I don't do nostalgia.
<Crainy> YEAH
<Crainy> my MLP episodes are finished with downloading
<Crainy> now guess
<Crainy> which episodes did i download?
<Iks> the pinkie breakdown one
<FreezeFrame> All of them.
<bicyclerepairman> ALL OF THEM?
<Crainy> you are both wrong!
<HaysforPonies> Allllllll the episodes. All of them.
<Crainy> i downloaded:
<Iks> dowload ALL the episodes!
<Crainy> griffon the brush off
<Crainy> and
<Crainy> Swarm of the century
<Crainy> and
<Crainy> wait, let me check
<bicyclerepairman> download ALL the episodes?
<Crainy> and the zacora one
<Crainy> why?
<Nashy> Did you also download the Monty Python spam sketch?
<Crainy> BECAUSE
<Crainy> they all have awesome pinkie moments
<Crainy> btw, i always laughed in the cinema like crap when i heard that at 00:43:
<Crainy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cJSke77GPc&feature=related
<Crainy> for that accomplishement alone Michael Bay should get best director
<Nashy> Amazing that people actually paid to watch Transformers.
<Iks> yeah no kidding
<Nashy> The first MIGHT be excusable.
<prince-dari> My dad and I started laughing really loudly in the cinema when Dumbledore died in the 6th HP film.
<Crainy> dude
<Crainy> ill cut you
<Nashy> I saw it for free though.
<Pinkie_Pie> Hi
<AllisZero> Good lunch
<Crainy> not you, prince
<Pinkie_Pie> Lol
<prince-dari> XD
<Crainy> but ill cut nashy and iks
<RobotPinkie> ohai
<Nashy> Right.
<bicyclerepairman> i watch it for the cars
<Crainy> i saw it 4 (!) times, and there -is-nothing-you-can-do-about-it
<TheSonicRainboom> Hello there everypony!
<Nashy> No accounting for taste.
<TheSonicRainboom> Was making muffins...I blame Pinkie for it.
<bicyclerepairman> why would i want to do anything about it, it's your wasted time
<RobotPinkie> that reminds me, I should probably eat something...
<Nashy> It's not my money so meh.
<bicyclerepairman> it's TheSonicRainboom :O
<RobotPinkie> also ohay AllisZero
<AllisZero> Yeah, I got at work at 7:45 this morning
<AllisZero> Haro RP
<Crainy> is it the sonic, and the rainboom, or the sonic rainboom?
<Crainy> and if yes, which one?
<Crainy> did sonic cause the rainboom
<Crainy> or is it a SONIC rainboom?
<TheSonicRainboom> Oh goody.
<Crainy> like the one rainbow dash did which got him killed?
<TheSonicRainboom> ...you mean her?
<bicyclerepairman> it'd be sonic's rainboom then, now wouldn't it?
<AllisZero> So sad that
<AllisZero> The phone I was so anxiously waiting for for months is finally being released the day after tomorrow
<RobotPinkie> what phone is that?
<AllisZero> And I'm not getting it because it's already an outdated piece of hardware :p
<AllisZero> Droid Bionic
<Crainy> oh gosh, yeah
<Crainy> you will never get that into my head
<Crainy> i alwasy view rainbow dash as a him when im not thinking about it
<Crainy> even though i know shes a she
<Crainy> thats the power of the first impression
<TheSonicRainboom> I think it like this. Mane 6 = girls
<RobotPinkie> lol not nearly as outdated as my phone, though
<Crainy> she just looks so guyish to me
<DeadPool> i still think they're genderless
<Nashy> 99% girls
<DeadPool> anyways here's something for you people
<bicyclerepairman> everyone in equestria is female unless otherwise specified
<DeadPool> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MY4nNdetOdp0lssuFjrIm6356lflFBrFlWheF21XgSg/edit?hl=ro
<prince-dari> I've never assumed the wrong gender for any ponies.
<prince-dari> It seems pretty obvious to me.
<TheSonicRainboom> Colts = males, have a more square face
<AllisZero> Oh, man, mine either. It's a first gen droid phone, it was low-end at the time they released it
<FreezeFrame> Yo, dari
<RobotPinkie> mine too... I want one that's 2.0 at least
<AllisZero> The thing is that next month they're releasing phones with 50% stronger specs than the Bionic
<prince-dari> Hey FreezeFrame.
<User_7233> SOMANYPONIES
<Nashy> Snips and Snails don't.
<Nashy> D_D
<AllisZero> So it makes no sense to buy a phone that was supposed to have come out in April now in September
<TheSonicRainboom> ...
<TheSonicRainboom> Damn.
<Crainy> i also cant imagine DJ Pon3 to be a girl
<User_7233> ?
<RobotPinkie> yeah, I guess that's true
<User_7233> what?
<Crainy> i dont think they all have scare faces
<Crainy> *square
<User_7233> DJ Pon3 is a filly brah
<Crainy> it just depends, if you are as awesome as big mac or not
<TheSonicRainboom> Pinkie brainwashed me with her songs D:
<User_7233> The game
<Crainy> lol
<FreezeFrame> PON-3 is definitely a filly DJ
<Nashy> Guess because Snips/Snails haven't gone through puberty or something.
<Crainy> the same happened to me, sonicrainbooom
<AllisZero> You can never have the latest and greatest for more than a few months, but if you're dropping $300+ on a phone, you want to make sure it's worth your monies
<bicyclerepairman> well, some faces are ambiguous
<Crainy> cupcakes...
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Cereal Velocity: Story: Inkblot (http://tinyurl.com/3pwkxhz)
<AllisZero> I'm dropping Verizon too as soon as I can, I get horrible reception around here
<bicyclerepairman> just look at the wonderbolt poster in ep..1, i think
<TheSonicRainboom> I mean, i'm laughing at everything that would make me stress, and I now have urge to bake sweet stuff.
<RobotPinkie> yeah... though I never spend that kind of money on a phone either way, lol
<Nashy> And throw parties to solve any problem.
<AllisZero> Yeeeeah I never did either, but I was ready to if it means having something worthwhile for two years
<Nashy> Or just throw a party.
<FreezeFrame> So, Inkie and Blinkie are the official fanon names for Pinkie's sisters, while her folks are Sue and Clyde?
<TheSonicRainboom> Par-TAY!
<Nashy> Baking stuff is too much hassle.
<Nashy> You just eat 'em!
<Crainy> you do the poney pockey
<RobotPinkie> official fanon? now you're confusing me...
<AllisZero> Lul
<FreezeFrame> Default assumption among the fans
<AllisZero> Dunno, Clyde doesn't look like the name of a proper rock farmer to me
<FreezeFrame> Unlike Ditzy Doo/Derpy Hooves
<TheSonicRainboom> Cupcakes! So sweet and tasty!
<FreezeFrame> Or Colgate/Romana
<RobotPinkie> ah okay
<Crainy> cupcakes, dont be too hasty
<Crainy> cupcakes, and if they like them
<Crainy> cupcakes, then ill still make them
<Crainy> cupcakes, i trust no pony
<Crainy> cupcakes, they all are phony
<Crainy> cupcakes, i know my target
<Nashy> ...not again.
<Crainy> cupcakes, ill never forget
<Crainy> THIS IS ALL HER FAULT
<Crainy> rainbow dash is gonna pay...
<FreezeFrame> You gotta do the cooking by the book
<Mic> Step 1: Remove Cutie MArk
<Mic> Step 2: Play with wings
<Mic> Step 3: Bitcher wings
<bicyclerepairman> i'd tie them down first
<HaysforPonies> Is it that time for Pinkamena's Law?
<Mic> Step 4: Snap Wing Bone and rips it off
<TheSonicRainboom> This chat is 'PG'.
<Crainy> mic, stop it
<AllisZero> Is it bad I caught myself saying "Good evening, gentlemen" in Joker's voice twice already today?
<Crainy> i hate the fanfic
<RobotPinkie> weren't those names used by the animators, or something? the pac-man names, I mean...
<Mic> :3c
<Crainy> kill yourself
<Crainy> or give me your face
<Nashy> It doesn't look PG to me...
<PsychicKid> I hate all fanfics
<PsychicKid> So it's ok
<Mic> It's really tame compared to other stuff I've seen.
<TheSonicRainboom> I just skipped it with "That's not Pinkie. Pinkie wouldn't do that."
<Mic> I mean REALLY tame.
<TheSonicRainboom> And tadah, no power.
<PsychicKid> Infact you can't convince me that a single good fanfic exists
<Mic> I spent more time laughing at the organ puns.
<Crainy> as i said, i seperate between Pinkie and Cupcakes pinkie
<PsychicKid> Except maybe that 48 some chapter Earthbound fanfic
<Crainy> i like them both
<prince-dari> Mic: The puns were funny. XD
<PsychicKid> But that's less of a fanfic and more of a retelling of the game in literary form
<Mic> The puns were the best part.
<Mic> That made reading it so worth while.
<bicyclerepairman> and therefore a fanfic, no?
<RobotPinkie> Nah, though it would be bad if you caught yourself saying "Why so serious?" in the same way the Joker does it, maybe :P
<AllisZero> Haha
<Nashy> I like the show-accurate fanfics.
<Crainy> i never red a single fanfic
<Barry> Hi all
<Crainy> and i dont intent too
<TheSonicRainboom> Well, I liked "Tough Love".
<Barry> And I mean "all" as in everyone
<Nashy> sounds like shipping :G
<Crainy> weirdly, the songs of MLP that i like the most contain the things that i hate in fanfics the most
<Crainy> as in, gore and shipping
<Barry> Not just you, AllisZero
<AllisZero> I'm honored anyway. Haro Barry
<User_8872> what is Shipping? and hello fellow bronies
<TheSonicRainboom> Nashy, it was about Rainbow Dash failing her Wonderbolts tryout
<Crainy> lyra and bonbon was my favorite MLP song before the cupcake song arrived
<RobotPinkie> ohay Barry
<Nashy> Oh, no shipping?
<Barry> How are you, AiZ?
<TheSonicRainboom> Nope.
<Barry> and you, RP
<TheSonicRainboom> I'm not into that kind of things..
<FreezeFrame> I don't mind shipping, as long as it stays PG, PG-13 at the absolute most
<AllisZero> Little disappointed after yesterday's fiasco at the car dealership but I'll live. You?
<User_7233> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyQlryTt-0
<PsychicKid> [13:08:11] <Nashy> I like the show-accurate fanfics.
<PsychicKid> No such thing
<User_8872> that's exactly why I don't read fanfics
<Thorinair> User_7233: that always scares the shit out of me
<User_7233> lol
<Nashy> Actually, there are a few.
<bicyclerepairman> because there might be something in it that you enjoy?
<AppleDash[Narc]> Fanfiction is all about imagination
<User_7233> well, im off to play saints row 2
<prince-dari> Meh.
<PsychicKid> I find it insanely hard to believe that there are fans out there with the ability to stay show-accurate, in character, and on par with the show's writers.
<prince-dari> >imagination
<AppleDash[Narc]> "Show-Accurate" means writing an episode of MLP itself
<TheSonicRainboom> I don't know why I end up reading the ones under 'Sad' more than 'Normal'
<prince-dari> >write in an already established universe with already established characters
<prince-dari> :P
<bicyclerepairman> honestly, saying things like "i haven't ever read a single fanfic because they're all bad", i just stupid
<User_7233> I like crossovers
<RobotPinkie> could be worse, fever's starting to die down i think. kinda hard to tell when you're on antipyretics, though. how u Barry?
<AppleDash[Narc]> ^^ YES
<Crainy> i dont think they are all bad
<PsychicKid> Fanfics by default are bad though
<bicyclerepairman> *is, not i
<TheSonicRainboom> I've never eaten garlic and I hate it thus I will never taste it :x
<Crainy> i just dont care for them
<User_7233> stargate, metal gear solid, and the starcraft ones are all really good
<AllisZero> Dang, sick?
<Crainy> and i really dont want to read shipping or something..
<User_7233> so are the fallout ones
<TheSonicRainboom> Crainy do like me, avoid shipping
<bicyclerepairman> shipiping is cute
<RobotPinkie> yeah, i've been worse though, so i can't complain too much
<Crainy> nah, i dont want to read them at all
<AppleDash[Narc]> din't forget the Metro 2033 one
<Crainy> whats the point?
<PsychicKid> I havn't read a single pony fic nor do I intend to
<AppleDash[Narc]> don't*
<bicyclerepairman> because "shipping" applies to anything
<PsychicKid> I had my fill of hurrdurr with the Powerpuff fandom
<Crainy> same as psychickid
<User_7233> shipping is wierd, it has nothing to do with boats.
<bicyclerepairman> hm, there might be ship ships
<User_7233> oh gob
<bicyclerepairman> i haven't looked, but it's the internet, why shouldn't there be any?
<Nashy> A Dashed Reputation, A Year to the Day, Chancing Canterlot, The Iron Dragon
<PsychicKid> I think what sealed the deal for me was X-rated Animal Crossing fanfics
<PsychicKid> Written by a 12 yearold girl
<PsychicKid> I had to wash my eyes out with bleach
<AppleDash[Narc]> well, 'm gonna go to #Study since there's a lot of FF hate here
<LvS> i don't hate ff
<Nashy> Think they were all pretty close to the show.
<User_8872> I don't hate fanfics, they're just not my cup of tea
<Iks> i wonder.... has there been a twilight zone fanfic?
<User_7233> EEYYUUUP
<LvS> i think there was one
<AppleDash[Narc]> If fans exist, there will be fanfics
<LvS> i'm really not sure, though
<DesertRose> as in twilight the books/movies
<TheSonicRainboom> Hey, i'm not saying you can't dislike fanfics. Just saying you could be surprised.
<User_7233> IM 12 WHAT IS THIS MY LITTLE PONY?
<DesertRose> /paraspite
<prince-dari> I know someone who dislikes all fanfics.
<TheSonicRainboom> Has he/she read all fanfics?
<TheSonicRainboom> Boy, what wa waste..
<DesertRose> well thats just someone who doesnt like reading
<AppleDash[Narc]> someone link poor 7233 to Episode 3, 4, or 16
<prince-dari> DesertRose: Nope.
<PsychicKid> prince-dari, me?
<Nashy> I dislike fanfics that don't stay close to the show.
<prince-dari> Someone eventually corralled him into reading 5 chapters of Fallout Equestria.
<AppleDash[Narc]> no, he means like... racist against fanfics
<LvS> i suppose there's nothing wrong with disliking the concept of fanfics
<PsychicKid> [13:15:58] <DesertRose> well thats just someone who doesnt like reading
<prince-dari> Thought it was average, not good.
<AppleDash[Narc]> not at all, but it's still fun :P
<PsychicKid> Nah, I just don't like fanfics :V
<prince-dari> And that is was lacking in some areas a lot.
<PsychicKid> Part of my issue is some intense mental scarring of some fanfics that were basically Cupcakes taken up to 11
<AppleDashWINS> but that's Cupcakes
<PsychicKid> >missing my point
<prince-dari> I have to ask him for his reasoning as to why they're all bad.
<TheSonicRainboom> Psychic, you could always heed Pinkie's advice
<prince-dari> I can't remember.
<AppleDashWINS> yes, there are worse, but you know, don't like, don't read, which i'm sure you do
<TheSonicRainboom> "Oatmeal? Are you craz-"
<PsychicKid> Well duh
<PsychicKid> I havn't read a fanfic in...
<PsychicKid> 6-7 years at least
<DesertRose> Some fanfics are very good and well written. most of the others, not so much
<TheSonicRainboom> Go for A Shower of Stars
<Xiagu|Alseep> Sturgeon's Law
<PsychicKid> Again, mostly due to reading the ones that seriously screwed with my head
<RobotPinkie> hmmm, might be time for some ponies
<Xiagu|Alseep> 90% of everything is crap
<TheSonicRainboom> Yeah, they all have RD
<johnsey|workmode> then how can you know you dislike FiM fanfics?
<AppleDashWINS> I read what i want to read lol
<RobotPinkie> @ponytimemeter It
<Steven_Magnet> 6 It is 94% ponytime. (1526)
<PsychicKid> Because it's left me with a permanent impression that all fanfics by their very nature are bad.
<AllisZero> 94%
<AllisZero> exactly
<AppleDashWINS> whether or not something is "good" can be both ob/subjective
<RobotPinkie> good enough for me
<johnsey|workmode> that's only prejudice then
<AppleDashWINS> bad meaning poorly written? stupid in concept?
<PsychicKid> Of course it's prejudice.
<PsychicKid> Both, actually
<TheSonicRainboom> When I was a little filly and the sun was going dooooooown
<prince-dari> Good is subjective.
<prince-dari> :P
<TheSonicRainboom> The darkness and the shadows they would always make me froooooooown
<Xiagu|Alseep> The grimdark and the sadfics they would always make me froooowwwnnn
<AllisZero> Man I hate making these decisions
<TheSonicRainboom> I'd hide under my pillow from what I thought i saw
<PsychicKid> Why are we singing pinkie pie songs again
<AppleDashWINS> no story is good, though, if all of the characters are mutilated (figuratively) and the actual writing sucks
<TheSonicRainboom> I don't know, just felt like it.
<Xiagu> Because you need to learn to giggle at the ghostly, PsychicKid
<FreezeFrame> Why aren't we singing Pinkie Pie songs?
<PsychicKid> What.
<FreezeFrame> And chuckle at the Cupcakes
<AllisZero> What's more cost-effective, have our director of marketing with an old laptop that could give at any moment and just buy an extra battery
<TheSonicRainboom> But Granny Pie said to me that wasn't way to deal with fears at aaaaaaalll
<AllisZero> Or spend $2300 on a replacement
<TheSonicRainboom> She said Pinkie, you gotta stand up tall
<FreezeFrame> So what is?
<johnsey|workmode> and snortle at the clopfics?
<Xiagu> chortle at the clopfics*
<AppleDashWINS> i do something else to the clopfics
<PsychicKid> I'm over the depression that those fanfics sent me into
<FreezeFrame> Oh, you cad
<johnsey|workmode> !clop
*DerpyBot clops her forehooves together excitedly
<Iks> clop doesnt work... i think seth said that... clop does not work
<AppleDashWINS> I... IGNORE DEM. lols
<DerpyBot> ..what?
<PsychicKid> I can think about them without regressing back into batshit insane mode
<TheSonicRainboom> Damn, I forgot the lyrics.
<PsychicKid> But I just can't pull myself to read fics anymore
<LvS> if fanfics send you into depressions, you're probably taking them too seriously.
<PsychicKid> I was like 13-14
<FreezeFrame> The group of Best Young Fliers sidefics had a distressing bit in it.
<PsychicKid> I was a retarded kid
<AppleDashWINS> let the kid be; he had his life-changing moment and he lives well nough without fanfics lol
<RobotPinkie> depends on how old, and how much it's holding him back
<AppleDashWINS> kid meaning PsychicKid, then lol
<TheSonicRainboom> So giggle at the ghostly, guffaw at the creepy
<FreezeFrame> Learn to face your fears. You'll find that they can't hurt you, just laugh and make them disappear
<DesertRose> ^^
<Nashy> I suggest Chancing Canterlot, it's about the CMC, and no creepy/weird stuff
<FreezeFrame> Is that the one with Luna watching the CMCs to get out of the Gala?
<Xiagu> is it share your favorite fanfic hour?
<PsychicKid> >CMC fic
<PsychicKid> >nothx
<TheSonicRainboom> Thanks FreezeFrame forgot how it went
<RobotPinkie> if only I could make those decisions at work... we might not be in such a financial mess
<PsychicKid> I like the CMCs don't get me wrong but reading Applebloom's accent for that long would drive me insane.
<Nashy> Luna watching CMC was A Year to the Day.
<FreezeFrame> Ah
<Nashy> Which was also good.
<RobotPinkie> computers from the 90's... just... wonderful
<FreezeFrame> Luna watching CMC was adorable
<Xiagu> PsychicKid, whenever someone writes Rarity with excessive italics I want to strangle the author
<AlwaysSunny> I hope there's more Luna in season 2
<TheSonicRainboom> We're the cutie mark crusaders! On a quest to find out who we are!
<AlwaysSunny> and more Trixie
<Iks> there will be more luna in s2
*AppleDashWINS DAAAAAAARLING.
<Iks> it has been confirmed
<PsychicKid> Rarity's voice actress is brilliant
<AlwaysSunny> yea I read that interview
<Xiagu> And we will never stop the journey~ Not until we have our cutie maaaaaarrkkksss!
<AppleDashWINS> for months
<TheSonicRainboom> What ever shall we do?
<PsychicKid> She pulls off all of her speech nuances so perfectly
<AppleDashWINS> @Xiagu *guitarsolo*
<AlwaysSunny> I hope season 2 is as good as season 1
<Xiagu> I love Tabitha... just... not when she's being excessively Rarity. :S
<TheSonicRainboom> This isn't whining, THIS is whining!
<Xiagu> NMM's voice was amazing though.
<AppleDashWINS> Miss St Germain is awesome in general
<AllisZero> Rofl, wow
<AppleDashWINS> I love her WOONA voice
<TheSonicRainboom> Or was it "I'm not whining, i'm complaining."
<AppleDashWINS> all 3 seconds of it!
<Xiagu> TheSonicRainboom, both
<Xiagu> All two lines!
<Xiagu> ``I'm so sorry!''
<Xiagu> ``I missed you so much, big sister''
<AlwaysSunny> MLP definitely has some of the best voice acting
<AppleDashWINS> Sniffle* I missed you too
<AllisZero> It's 4 years old, not a bad machine considering how old it is
<TheSonicRainboom> Attempt to cover the world into darkness forever -> get away with it
<Xiagu> oh shush, that was NMM
<FreezeFrame> Substitute Harmony is wonderfully messed up.
<AlwaysSunny> well she was only banished to the moon for a thousand years
<Xiagu> they're two different entities by canon
<AllisZero> But it's heavy and bulky (17"), also overheats like a mofo
<AlwaysSunny> I wouldn't exactly call that getitng away with it lol
<TheSonicRainboom> You have a point there.
<FreezeFrame> Rainboom: According to Word of Faust, NMM was a possession
<PsychicKid> Maybe I should write a fanfic
<AllisZero> He brought it to me a few weeks ago, it sounded like a turbine
<RobotPinkie> ahh, so it might spontaneously combust
<Leonon> Luna and Celestia after episode 2 -> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cG50WsGMLYs
<TheSonicRainboom> But we still have the whole send 2 tickets -> know she has 5 friends dilemma. Help?
<AppleDashWINS> write a fanfic about why you hate fanfics :P
<prince-dari> >Luna so popular
<Xiagu> !link word_of_faust nightmare_moon
<DerpyBot> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/6169
<AlwaysSunny> I'm curious about the size difference of PC to the rest of the ponies
<prince-dari> >_>
<Nashy> But if you write a fanfic, wouldn't you have to do it with eyes closed?
<Xiagu> Not exactly a possession, but her transformation was caused by an external force
<PsychicKid> That's not difficult
<Nashy> Otherwise you'll end up READING a FANFIC!
<AlwaysSunny> and why Luna had a similar size but reverted back to little pony mode
<PsychicKid> It's not hard to type with your eyes closed
<AllisZero> Yep, I have another of the same model in the office, problems with the screen going black outta nowhere
<Triximancer> Did people get mad about the Pound Puppy thing? Don't see it on the front page anymore.
<Xiagu> AlwaysSunny, size diff of Princess Celestia? She's a bawss and the size of a real horse
<PsychicKid> Infact I'm typing this line with my eyes shut right now
<Nashy> It's hard to type accurately.
<Xiagu> Trufax, johnsey|workmode
<RobotPinkie> I dunno, depending on how hard it would be to transfer everything he needs, replacing it might be a good plan...
<PsychicKid> Not really.
<AlwaysSunny> I wonder if it has to do with her princess status
<PsychicKid> You'll make a bunch of mistakes that you may not catch, but it's not THAT hard
<Dashite> Get him a netbook. Make him suffer!
<PsychicKid> Just get someone else to proofread it
<Xiagu> AlwaysSunny, I would go with alicorn-status
<RobotPinkie> I mean if it suddenly bites the dust, then that's a major problem
<AlwaysSunny> oh right that's a good point
<AlwaysSunny> but Luna is about just as old
<RobotPinkie> ...depending on how he handles backups, I guess
<Nashy> Accurately to me is flawless. :G
<AllisZero> Haha our president has a little 12" Dashite, that I bought for him. He upgraded from a crappy 10" Mini, he loves me for it
<PsychicKid> wtf is that
<PsychicKid> what am I looking at
<PsychicKid> :G
<RobotPinkie> lolol
<AlwaysSunny> maybe it has to do that when Luna was NMM she had goddess status and goddess status is a different "form"
*PsychicKid tries to make that face IRL
<PsychicKid> ohgodwhy
<Nashy> :G
<AllisZero> RP, he doesn't have a ton of stuff on his machine, we keep mostly everything on the network
<Xiagu> AlwaysSunny, Luna is 1000 years younger at least
<AlwaysSunny> I think I'm delving too deep into it
<PsychicKid> 1000 years younger?
<AlwaysSunny> but Luna had similar size as PC when she was NMM
<PsychicKid> How do you figure that
<AllisZero> The thing about that 12" though is we got a 256 SATA 3 solid state, and even with the 1.6 dual-core, it flies like no tomorrow
<Xiagu> PsychicKid, she was trapped in the moon for 1000 years?
<Nashy> stasis on the MOON for 1000 years
<PsychicKid> She could still age
<RobotPinkie> ah okay, well... then I dunno
<AppleDashWINS> they're assuming Luna was in stasis as NMM and on the moon
<AlwaysSunny> I think this is one of those details that should just be put in the "It's a cartoon" category lol
<Xiagu> the show implied stasis, at least to me
<prince-dari> >making assumptions
<prince-dari> >implying that it must be correct
<prince-dari> :P
<RobotPinkie> I mean it'll need replacing once it spontaneously combusts, but then what's the harm in waiting?
<PsychicKid> But most "superlongsleeps" tend to have little to no aging
<AlwaysSunny> or "It's magic, I ain't gotta explain ****"
<TheSonicRainboom> A certain princess was asleep for 100 years and...
<Xiagu> PsychicKid, exactly. so Celestia kept getting older for 1000 years.
<AllisZero> Well, indeed
<MrPoniator> Screw logic, I'm an alicorn
<AllisZero> If the hard drive survives we're golden, even with the encryption on it
<RobotPinkie> lolol it's probably a good thing I don't make those choices for you :P
<Dashite> If you are going to have to spend the money anyway, and you have it in the budget now, what is the purpose in waiting?
<DesertRose> you can assume and theorize all you want but in the end it dont mean squat unless you can prove it
<darkwolf> rainbow dash
<AlwaysSunny> I still think that hasbro "meet Princess Celestia" video blooper was hilarious
<TheSonicRainboom> How can you prove something based on a cartoon?
<MrPoniator> Eh, DesertRose, people still like to theorize
<AppleDashWINS> Specualtion: pointless but fun
