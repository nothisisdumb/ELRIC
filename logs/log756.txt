Hello
Hi Hi
I want to ask all of them one thing
The singing VA's are different from the Actual VA's
i love pinkie's part out of all
BraveLittlePyro: it happens, but it's still Ashleigh Ball
yay, logged in to a song :3
RD's part gets a different melody and electric guitars, so awesome
Can someone explain the Magneto thing or at least point me to the direction that will explain?
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Caramel's cutie mark is caramel apples, not horseshoes. Seriously, why would a pony named Caramel have a horseshoe cutie mark?
their characters seem a little more played out to their extremes though don't they?
AT THE GALLLAAAAAA
did they remember to brush their teeth ?
When the artist finish your request, can they send their drawings to you in any way?
I feel stupid now
grandé gala

He's not that bad once you get to know him. He just adopts the douchey persona to scare off golddigging mares who only want him for his royal title and money
Nope
P0N-3: Never truer words
The camera is just focusing on 2 artists
Like Rarity
Link to MLP FiM S3 Ep3?

i got a beautiful oc
Is it just me or is the volume REALLY low? :(

It was a test of character. The only Pinkie Pie to survive everything was the Pinkie Pie who adapted to her foalsitting of the Cake foals. Even the first clone doesn't have that experience. I think it's safe to say that the surviving Pinkie Pie is the real one

General Question: As someone who isn't a brony, what would you guys say the best thing about the series is?
I do too.
lol
Boredom.
I'm RobStallion1
get on my level https://www.dropbox.com/s/2p29ivgmeiz0zci/Screenshot_2012-11-17-07-30-13.png?m
TiaraWhy: Your name is famous. ;) Let's say that's the truth
Just what a faker would say ;)
:|
CrystalPhoenix: also, his tumblr has shuted down
TiaraWhy, and your work are banned here T_T
bbl, good luck guys
QUESTION: wait, Derpy is a GIRL?!
Michael: Tiarawhy has a tumbler?! O.o
PonyisFriendship in Gameloft Live... I cheated to get gems, though. xD
TO tumbler!
yes Vordox
Michael, good point forgot about that
yeaaah no
Vordox: taken down
Someone near the start of the chat said "scotaloo". What would a Scottish Scootaloo look like?
TiaraWhy: i love your comics...if you really are the real TiaraWhy which i highly doubt
:I
he may just do line now
since that one took so long
Gameloft is like the next Capcom they want ya money!!!
:);):D:(:O>_>
Damnit. ._. why is Tumbler such an arse lately...
Luna is best pony
Thanks... I think
^
dont spam emotos pls
okay
TiaraWhy: <3 I think I recall a few of your works. =3
we will spam you :3
TiaraWhy: Better check up on Tumbler what happened... again
is it suddenly against their rules?
TiaraWhy: are you the real one?
so what did you guys think of the episode today
there's always a way around it
I have a question. favourite fruit?
and forgive me for being a dishonorable one but... I cheat.
Bronysith, it's stupid to ask that question directly
Fetch a painted wall
Insanity.
trying to get some of the ponies is ridiculously insane.
Vordox: Copyright and whatnot
Pain in the balls if you ask me
TiaraWhy: Wait... Copyright on Hasbro? Doubt that. ><
what are your favourite Chips Brand?
TiaraWhy: but anyways, i love that comic with cloud chaser and rumble
Its still a show for little girls, but its pretty good
Time for SNS!
@Jose i agree, im trying to get fluttershy and im at lvl43
yes, Friendship is Magic has better writing than anything else involving cartoon horse-girls!
i really should take some art classes
TiaraWhy: and the one where rainbow dash puts her mane in a pony tail
Im still a brony
just haters that, maybe reported it?
I remember rumble, not cloud chaser...
with what they discovered, you can just cheat and get her for free.
Who's that again?
now I'm focusing on expanding my land to the max
@Jose Yeah, the game wouldn't be so bad if things were at least reasonably priced, but there's no chance of getting Dash without cheating or paying hundreds of dollars
Question for ATC: What is the hardest thing you've had to animate pony-wise so far and what made it hard?
the cloud chaser x rumble one was cute
@Jose yeah but i dont use that cheat that much, i use it a bit
TiaraWhy, y i can't link anything here from you T_T It's unexceptable
Michael: AskPrincessMolestia got shut down yesterday, but it's up agian today, let's hope TiaraWhy has the same momentum
Bronysith You may want to lay off what your talking about
Oh, that one.
I actually think the time-cheat is enough to get money... only gems are still hard to farm
i only use it to get what I need.
ponies and shops
Vordox: hope so :(
that's it.
killerpony7733: thats why i stopped
Requst: Night of the Pinkie dead
GAKKLEGAK

QUESTION: how would you like it if MLP: FiM came to TV screens in the UK?

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_A71jVpGSQ
Bronysith: Just now, didn't see socks though :/
TiaraWhy: why?
Socks: it was on rarity
i dont know what word
"copyright"
BraveLittlePyro:
Easy for AskTheCrusaders .. it's his blog
@Venusy okay, but when it does come on Freeview, I think it will be on one of Channel 4's MANY cable networks
Soz
"and whatnot"
I'm back you guys!

Bronysith: Oh yeah!

Charizard was the coolest back then, its still sorta is now
rawr?
hi VenHur
Seeds of Kindness 2
BraveLittlePyro: Sorry pressed enter too early, unintended ping :P
What was the name of the video of chrysalis and cadence ( the music video yesterday)
pony_66151: or the trolls, impersinating hasbro
No problem
How do most people pronounce others nicks?
OH SHIT
welcome back VenHur
Yeah, Venusy is right, FiM airs on Boomerang in the UK
GAME GRUMPS DEMONS SOULS
Was playing Zombies and suddenly PING
Lol
Wb VenHur
CCCP: See-See-See-Pee
It's a combined initiative between Your Siblings and BfG to raise money for an orphanage and chicken farm in Uganda!

chichichipi

xD
MaxTheBrony: give me a min:)
aight :)
MaxTheBrony: Dont know what youre talking 'bout :P
okay nevermind
noone say the g word
my question: tom or breaburn?
I got to admit, that's one heck of stylish animation loop there. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOi4527jlvY&feature=channel&list=UL
so what did you guys think of the episode today
XD
*
MaxTheBrony: fire hive knife party PMV
i believe :$
pinkie died
Answer: Read it backwards, it spelles Artist. I wanted a rememberable name...the 360, means I do all kinds of art. Realism, Cartoon...whatever
inb4 Sumica goes "REDLINE"
alexxm: Awesome, first Pinkie centric episode I thought was properly good
The characters have stopped acting like caricatures, I am happy.
Vordox: That's what eventually made me watch Redline.
Ty ty :D
I just came back...Did Tsitra finish my request?
Well I'm off
Yes Caramel_Colours
you're welcome :)
Goodbye!
bye TiaraWhy
I actually thought this was one of my favrtite eps
bye TiaraWhy :)
/me hugs TiaraWhy goodbye
coloured as well
bye!
bye TiaraWhy!
Is there a DropBox for it?
bye TiaraWhy
did AskTheCrusaders really draw every frame of that pinkie animation?
farewell
yes he does everything
well, Gnight everypony! *yawns*
my question: tom or breaburn?
Night Michael :)
It's easy not to like any bird pokemon. If you're favorite is a fighting type
night Michael
AskTheCrusaders animates and he does not have to "draw" every single frame. But he does it frame by frame.
Bye Michael
*hugs*
bye Michael
Im winning!
skiepz
Gak or Floam?
Hard as a rock...
Those socks on rarity in the last episode were cute, no doubt. But they're not a fan shoutout. They're just part of the outfit. The animators weren't thinking "Hey, let's put socks on rarity because socks are a thing in the fandom!" when they came up with the outfit.
damn. not breaburn. i mean bloomberg >___<
^
XD
Thanks for dropping by TiaraWhy

Hi CountDoofus :)
Sap CountDoofus
*ba dum shee*
Hai CountDoofus :)
/me wears socks :3
:$
Heya CountDoofus
/me who wants look at my socks?
QUESTION: how would you feel if MLP:FiM moved to the Lifetime network?
Is there a dropbox for my request from Tsitra?
General Question: Do you guys have any tricks on how to not get distracted by other stuff? (Jan doesn't have to answer, I already know his answer. xD)
/me steals pony 811008s socks
Question: If you were a robot and you found out you were a robot, what would you do?
Salahir. What was/is the favourite Race you play in Warhammer 40k.
Tom not that question again XD
Requst: Matrix crossover, one Neo - Twilight Sparkle against many Pinkie Pies - Agent Smiths
Its best question
what time life time?
back
lol
what is life time
next question: who would win in epic war between rocks and trees?
/me pokes AJIsAwesome
i love dark souls happy nigga face
its a show for little girls, its good on the current tchannel
thelonepony you know any similar music videos?
did you see the .MOV reference in the last episode?
All the requests done will be collected and uploaded in a folder. (Some will be uploaded when the event finished.)
Lifetime is a TV channel.
yes^
MaxTheBrony: nope :/
Was there a refrence?
Lifetime network = sitcoms and dramas where women are the lead characters
Ah okey :P
What was it?
oh god a MLP reality show would be awful XD
11:38
I feel this episode is just full of references
dotmahv
I tend to avoid the .mov things like the plague, so I suspect I missed it.
refrence to what?
also the fanfic reference
Pinkie watches paint dry
Request: Matrix crossover, one Neo - Twilight Sparkle against many Pinkie Pies - Agent Smiths
with watching paint dry
I don't think that one'd be a fanfic reference.
But rocks can prevent nutrient absorbance
oh yeah, i said that during that part
Hasbro's cool nuff
Fanfic reference?
"Think of the dullest thing imaginable" "Watching paint dry"
Trees make sounds when they fall and no ones around, rocks don't fall
Ninja Rocks!
I rather thing THAT one is a coincidence.
*think.
Trees can be reformed into pony shapes by Rarity! Epic win
A socks reference, which now makes it canon
That's actually a thing outside the fandom, you can't really say it's a reference
@pony_429860 added your request
Honestly I don't think watching paint dry is the most boring thing
No, but it's the standard answer.
Nice *-*
well the fic is about the philosophical musics of pinkie pie as she... well.. watches paint dry :)
MaxTheBrony: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6j5NW5xlfWA maybe you like queen?
raaah
"It's about as interesting as watching paint dry/grass grow"
*musings
The writers have repeatedly stated they don't read the fanfics, though.
watching grass grow would be so much mmore boring
yes
So I'll still stamp it with a "Bloody unlikely"
I got album title here today at 3PM. 9 hours later I've listened to professional grifers 45 times.
@pony_429860 mind to tell me a name to know who requested this? ;)
It's just a coincidence.
Aye.
eeyup
They do exist, you know.
:P
I aquired DoW II not to long ago
General question: whats your favorite MLP web series? stuff like friendship is witchcraft, two best sisters, moonstuck stuff like that
But everything must be done in dedication to US, GilDash.
no expansions though
and now mods yet
dotmahv
One trick pony is also an epic song O.o
(which seems to be an important aspect to finding patterns. :P)
wait, don't we have someone called OneTrickPony in chat?
I just wish they made expansions free.
Probably.
Occasionally, I think.
xD
It's a fairly obvious pun, after all.
Dave Polsky
is the stream down?
Have some Metroid Music
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=za05W9gtegc&feature=g-u-u
plot maker for too many pinkies
Anyway, I believe I'll go nod off to bed now.
you know
G'night all.
i dont pay attention that much tbh :3
Lasharus: G'night! :)
but really, would MLP:FiM fit in with the Lifetime network?
new face
Night Lasharus :)
it's good but i want MA Larson
bye Lasharus
It's all about time best episode i think
ATC request to draw or animate?
Could you draw a Tank (RD's tortoise) with a cane, monocle, and bow? :3
this debate about whether pinkie pie watching paint dry as either being a reference or a coincidence... I'll just chalk it up to pinkie pie being pinkie pie :)
Answer: I never get to watch them, I'm always drawing...however my favorite is the upcoming Double Rainboom episode that Flamingo1986 and 100 other bronys are working on! It may be completed next year!
crush kill destroy swag!
@AskTheCrusaders: Draw Sweetie Bell on Scootaloo's scooter!
REQUEST: Applejack!

Ryunosuke but you get my point
This is not a spoiler. Did anyone ells catch the animation mistake in the latest episode? Applejacks cousin (Apple Fritter) changes hair and eye color for a few moments.
:p
It does look a bit weird to see 1500 coming in every week via wire...
imho: Today's ep > Season beginning
genocide is now canon

Dashie_Dashie: this is what i call music

@Luna okay, someone else removed your Sherlock request xD

And I removed the request =P
@Snowflake that will be my game of the year for sure when fighting is magic comes out

@caramel_colours im doing good, still need to eat dinner but waiting for ponies XD

My MLP army is grooooowing

Ah yes, technical difficulties. They're so much fun.
:O
Yay! I finally got my Luna's Guard pony in the Android/iOS game :D
Oh noes Derpyculties
k-lined? Whats that?
TheArbiter264: well find thing s to talk about then
MakerDusk: shall you do the honors?
Aww nuts
You are lucky
Technical difficulties make the world go round.
What difference does it make if he proxies up and evades again anyway?
flesruoy ot klat syawla nac uoy
Dari, you should stream more Who.
nah, quieting them makes them suffer
I just only got Braeburn :F
cutie pie.

+q is a worse fate than +b imo
Beware the +q
lol
Hello IT have you tried turning it oof and on again>
@Yavos lucky, im still trying to get Fluttershy -_-
ello?
+q?
Hi IOS_6_maps
@snowflake That's what caused this!
what is the +Q
What is k-lined?
.-.
I'm actually still trying to get Applejack :U
but +q is so much more satisfying
00,02Rex_Mundi, its a network wide ban
Discord runs Skype.
lawl jaymoo is unbanned eh
I blame Di-
Joomay, go away
just imagine the lag he's getting behind the proxies too XD
well then
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I have a question. would the VA's count as canon stuff to draw?
tell us old wise ones, what is a q?
00,02+b bans you from this room, k-line is the whole network
Chav
Pls
@Thunderlane I'm getting now about 40000 bits a day. That's pretty much enough to not need to cheat anymore :D
way to beat me to the punch, snowflake
What's going in heeeeeeeeeerrrrrn
:O, network wide ban, that sounds pretty bad
Jaymoo~
>Chav pls
00,02CrystalPhoenix, talk of bans
Fluffeh <3
>Says the Aussie chav
i never want to get a ban like that
Le Gasp xD
Phase4: which potentially bans a ton of other people too, right?
SkunkTari: so is ban evading
Voy Cimos, we did it!
still nothig for the stream's feed
Phase4: Thats kind of a nuclkear option isnt it?
also dari, if im not mistaken, MakerDusk and IRCops can actually detect the pattern of their proxies and efficiently k-line them
The Q Continuum.

dosh*
That Derpy is such a sir.
Shoo Adam
Hi TheArbiter264 :)
its like how MakerDusk k-lined that admin dude
so we simply add them into a database that doesn't allow them to connect
Honestly, who reads the Tos?
ToS*
@Yavos i only get like close to 2000 bits a day i dont have that many shops yet but im close to getting her i got 46000 bits so far
Phase4: how big is said network that can be k-lined?
If there are repeating parts in their hostname, you can do that
Just ban the area
GigabitHarmonie: Get in contact on skype!
how are you doing thelonepony
But otherwise I don't think there's much you can do other than use a proxy blacklist?
GigabitHarmonie: Hurry!
GigabitHarmonie: Emergency!
TheArbiter264: great, still sick and you?
Like a sir.
Everyone just switch on the music stream until the audio is back.
@Thunderlane You've almost done it. Yay!
we can also ban by ip range
question to the viewers: Have you gone to a con? If so...which one...if not...do you want to?
00,02twilight_sprinkle, it bans individual hostnames or by pattern, so anywhere from one address to entire countrys
:'(
Vordox: I had a look at it
Phase4: dayum. also whats +q?
I went to EQLA... my lord it was terrifying
00,02twilight_sprinkle, MakerDusk knows more than me, he actually runs it
Wasn't working when I did though
i went to Galacon this year *g*
Any Europa Barbarorum players here?
Die4Ever: How was it?
It might just have been borked at the time
@Yavos eeyup i really want her too since she my 2nd favorite pony
I'll take another look
00,02twilight_sprinkle, blocks you from saying anything in a channel
It was Great *-*
Galacon (and non-Brony: AnimagiC and Leipziger Buchmesse, both in Germany)

Nom nom nom
I was at BUCK, but would like to go to GalaCon next year
TheArbiter264: everypony is best pony :)
4 hour sleep and wake up to the power knocked out.

Is there no stream right now?
i, for one, welcome our new pink coloured equines overlords
Nope
but yeah todays ep was pretty neat, although there was too much background music imo
What do you guys think of the idea of the MLP show ending with Season 3, but FIM continuing with hour long DVD/Blue ray specials similar to G3 MLP?
chuck testa
Pepperoni is always a good standby.
I didn't notice the bgm
pony_4908 correct, which is why I'm posting Whose Line :)
but I usually don't-
Rex_Mundi: no
cachi01: we must use them as Patapons >:3
Meh thats alright. A bit vanilla though
No discussion of the ep till 24 hours after it's aired guys
and plain cheese
^
Going good. Thank you again Tsitra for my Request! ^^ I Love it!
Not everyone has seen it

Perhaps the background music was too amazing and just stuck out in that regard. :P

MakerDusk: paypal is even being more idiotic about it recently...
I think I might of heard of it.
DRW just watch this http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&v=52UiquGeUBI&feature=endscreen
DashWithRainbows: Now can you tell why?
Rex_Mundi: It's the world's best fandom, of course. :)

<.<
>.>
<_< >_>
Mmm.
the pixelkitties trixie?
Never watched Tron, it doesn't seem computery enough to me
so what time would that happen?
or is it something John Joseco and miss Libman did again?
Canadian_Brony: cachi01 FEAR NOT! YOUR LARGE HAM HAS ARRIVED!
Where's Tron Guy?
YESH!!
Watch the original. It's about as computery as 1982 can get.
/me pokes AttackWithHugs
/me noms on large ham
YAAAAAAAAAY
So looking at the Twitter there will be no new Pixel Perfect Pony show tonight even after the move
...."Resource Hog"? There are GANGS in computers?
/me squeaks and pokes Jmo back

YOU KNOW
What the? Tron game?
greetings people :-)
CANADABRONY SUX
This should be fun
No pillows
Question: How many of you artists are going to be at next Galacon?
Hi DesertFOX.
greetings, DesertFOX
Dammit donate accept my money already :U
J_E_Smith71 then where the hell are they doing the show? Did they shut it down entirely?
i find hilarious how tron looks so awesome. but the entire movie is just stunts doin ridiculous things infront of a green screen
Not_A_Canada_Brony: even your name? damn
I saw the new James Bond movie "Skyfall" it was awesome! ^3^
I don't think I've heard of this Tron game...
A yottabyte is one septillion bytes. To save all those bytes you need a data center as big as the states of Delaware and Rhode Island. It doesn't seem like much, until they tell you the price tag: $100 trillion
British hospital drama.
Q*UI++-----------CANADABRONY SUX
Hi DesertFOX. ^^
I am throwing my master card at the monitor, please :V
IT'S A TRAP :[

Ponies47: really? i've heard its bad &_)
6_9

Canadian_Brony: It says on the Twitter they'll announce when it will begin airing there
question to all: internet hug? (yeah im being corny I know)
08,01aw man, now i wanna watch Tron Legacy
Don't believe everything you hear...
J_E_Smith71 ok, thx

08,01i *love* that film
Pew pew
/me Slaps cachi01 "Go see it yourself" :P
pony_4908: not bad but very unrealistic
Internet hug it is.
MakerDusk: Some just aren't deep enough.
This is EXACTLY what happens in your computer every day
yaay
General Question: Other than ponies, what is your favorite thing to draw?
Everlasting_Joy: that's horrible!
GalaCon for the win :D
/me likes it XD
CriticKitten: Reboot provides a better representation
>open program
>fight to deth
cachi01: If you're talking about the original, that's as realistic as the technology of the time could allow. And taking place inside a computer grid, what WOULD be 'realistic' anyhow? :P
seems legit
I still havent seen Tron Legacy - dont ask why
Perry, remember to drink :U
pony_4908: i mean skyfall the new 007 movie lol
This is more like a bad antivirus trying to eliminate the virus
>_>Corrupted applejack:nope.TOTALY not epic>_>
"To a machine, all reality is virtual." -From the Animatrix

Question: Who wants a flugelhorn?
y r we waching somepony play Tron
cachi01 be a hippie, which will never be cool..
was he just holding the gun SIDEWAYS? DAAYYYYUUM.
but being hipster is too mainstream D:
What's your guy's opinions on Fan Ponies?
It's like one of those modern military FPS games, except with color. So really it's better than an FPS.
Isnt it funny how the disk always come back to you?
eXe2001: I want a flugelhorn!
dont be a druggie, thats my thing cachi01
who else wang a flugelhorn?
mh
want*
This looks like a cross between the Halo series and the Metroid Prime series...
even sprunkls tell me that
CriticKitten: Sad...
Actually, this game makes me want to play Metroid Prime. XD
lol drugs
Kurra: :P
Kurra I wub dat game :)
I'm still waiting for a Metroid movie....
08,01DoctoDoctorWho: stop being so obsessive; if i'm not around, i'm not around
btw. looks like black ops 2 saved cod
Kurra, no.
Never.
Ever.
They said one would be made by 2008.
Jmo, yes.
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Custom Compilation #93
LOL
@Lunar added
that minecraft BG that is being drawn is looking real good
cachi01: How
tell me?
A few cycles!
If you want a Metroid movie, you want to ruin the franchise.
Jmo, the franchise is already ruined.
I can see hi on the stream?
Or have you blocked out memory of Other M?
Only cause of Other M
I KNOW! Disney should buy Nintendo. Then they could make a decent Metroid movie. :D
thelonepony: Campaign = awesome. Multiplayer = better than the old ones, Zombies=FAKIN GREAT
him*
So true
Dat nod
Dat logic

Quotable quote

grief is not so cool

Nyra, oh just taking a break from my studies
Flugelhorn is a real instrument
killerpony7733 it would make sense, seeing as how the games look astonishngly similar in graphics and gameplay.
Alright, I must be off to do some studying. One of my teachers is giving me an exam right before Thanksgiving break. I'll see everyone again in about three hours.

Cool. I'm just seein' if AlienWarhead was on. Been tryin' to get a hold of him for Skype conversation regarding the film I'm producing.
I don't think Disney would need to buy out Nintendo outright to make a Metroid movie. All Disney would need is an agreement between the two companies

metroid prime was 2003?
eeyup
Stylistically, I mean. Yeah, Metroid Prime was 2003 or 2004.

A computer can't find a prime number?

Just ask him to divide by zero...
The funny thing is I have a pre-order for H4, yet haven't yet picked it up. Whats wrong with me?
keyword is "even" prime number
the precioouuuuuus
every "even" number is divisible by 2... except 2
cachi01 whatev, I'm not much for FPS's

LYRA?
tron furry r34? lolwut
I've never tasted Nutella before. What's it taste like?
I should've known.
AttackWithHugs: AWESOMENESS
AttackWithHugs: like heaven
08,01AttackWithHugs: like chocolatey sex
Nyra Correction if they have anthromorphic abilties
ponies are optimus prime furries
Also, cachi01 someone mentioned about r34 pinkie x pinkie x pinkie
Still, Lyra.
Lyra wants to be a furry. Just sayin'
Bigcheese: Ponies are anthropomorphic, Furries like anthro stuff.
Nyra Or simply asid human abilities
08,01AttackWithHugs: chocolate and hazelnut
SickCanary: ooooh >_>
Rex_Mundi: indeed
:D Never a dull moment in Bronystate chat :)
08,01that's pretty much exactly what it tastes like
Honestly, you don't have to fear most furs or anything....
Ponies are like half feral half anthro
wait
Good night , good luck with the streams
Indeed to the second part.
/me is a furry
I don't know them
I'd get Nutella but I don't feel lik spending about 3-4 bucks on it
Nice analogy Vivix
/me is just kidding
/me is part of the feral fandom
i dont liek furry r34
AttackWithHugs: nutella and strawberries.
/me notes that being um... xeno... no... specio-phobic isn't an easy, fun, or good way to go about life D:
AttackWithHugs: beleave me. its worth the weight
I'm too shy to go on Brony sites
Bigcheese, oh gosh that sounds delicious
toy story R34?
LOL
They need Vinyl Scratch.
I'm a fur! :D
Ferals are more--animalistic than ponies, but ponies are more animalistic in design than most anthro's
Quick_Thinker, we're talking about Nutella now :3
Rex_Mundi, there's a fanfic
Rex_Mundi: I was about to say that.

waiting for the one person to be all track 1
medacris: but the fandom is great! You're missing out, mate.
Vordox: Internets*
Human like qualities like talking are anthropomorpsim. Ponies can talk.
AttackWithHugs: Not sure if Nazi or just opportunist
08,01Vivix: i *bet* you you're wrong
LunaMyDarling: yeah.
@medacris you don't really need to be shy on the internet

Kurra why you ping me?

Question: what are you guys taking in university?
No idea if it did, probably
hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii thelonepony
Southwestern Uni! I visited there! :D
I find Derpy offensive
What I wonder though, is if ponyness has made people want to rise above the sex stuff and fetishes of either fandom! 'Cuz that would be a great testimony :D
Hi TheArbiter264 :)
You are Crystal?
Yup
I hope, rather, that it has made people respect sex and fetishism
Minecraft?
Sweet, eh.
Question: how long is the stream going on tomorrow (well, today in my time zone)?

I can assume you are as well Nyra?
O_o
@medacris don't post too many links... it might be considered spam...
yeah.:D
Oh ya.
That was...quick and easy
So... what is Tsitra actually drawing?
Okay, that's the last one
....
Was that a Worm?
VIRUS!
thelonepony: give up, there is no escape. you must pull the trigger
eeyup
I can see Rarity studying that
major
I wonder, how many people here check FA for pony art?
Aaaa gotta sleep people. Even Pinkie can't go on eternally
XD
Goodnight MadSurge :P
/me grabs the gun ;^'

I remember my first year
i was just playing Mine Craft thelonepony
;^;*
MadSurge: goodnight
Otters indeed.
bye MadSurge
Night MadSurge
Bye MadSurge :)
not a member on FA, but I check e621 for safe-pony ocattionally
/me is a double major for math and physics
jeez, botched spelling
fear the capstone projects. *shudder*
All rhe pings <3
Funny thing is. Best Minecraft seed = Cloudsdale.
wazzup peeps!
/me gives the gun to twilight_sprinkle ;^; "you have to do it"
Hey guys, At 10:30 EST "Too Many Pinkie Pies" is airing on the hub, is that the new episode?
Nyra interesting
"What's wrong with your connection?" "I'm on dialup, son"
aw shit
Hi Deacon :)
thelonepony D:
At least I think it is.
@Venusy The stream is going from midnight to midnight (GMT+1), so about 20 hours left
Ohai Deacon
not dialup
bronychampp wh yyes it is, but no more streams of it now
furries are awesome
you got to do it sprunkls ;~;
NO I DONT
Its either Cloudsdale or Ponyville.
My major is animation and graphic arts/advertising!
Oh ok, its not airing here tonight
thelonepony: no, its your job :I
back online
no, shoot me pls;^;
Canada_Brony: More like... a lot of Furries are awesome, but some of the others are...
no, it's 2h
no
centeral is 2 hours ahead of pacific
@_@
1 hour ahead is mountain time
also bronychamp its like a good 10 hrs after it aired we air it at like 10 in the morining where i live
It ends at ^P.M. EST
pacific, mountain, central, eastern
*6P.M/
Rex_Mundi, you mean like Bronies?
/me wonders if that gak filter is still on
A nicely layed out map/world though is Equestria. Big zones and lots of iron.
10am EST
yup, still on
It looks great, Gabby.
i know one thing
So you guys do do OC's?
11,01Still wonder?
fight club
Also, it aired at 10:30am
its off :D
Sounds like Keith David.
thelonepony: hmm...neh
no OCs
i was making traps in MineCraft
twilight_sprinkle: why not ;^;
crossovers allowed, though
Aw okay, sorry
/me likes to use his ID
thelonepony: because then life wont torture you anymore :>
CrystalPhoenix: sort of, but I think the furries have it worse, by nature of them being around since the 80s
Shiz hasn't said much tonight, she must be really into this game.
oh u Sprunkls :D
Could we get a picture of Derpy sleeping on a cloud?
:3
/me is a brother of Z
I kinda wanted to see Muslim Human!Fluttershy and Jewish Human!Rarity being BFF's
Rex_Mundi, Proportionally probably not but in raw quantity maybe
And hiii Perry my dear
Dick_Clean.exe died by your disk
/me ate Z
I still think Tron was badass in KH.
/me smokes Z
Hey derp
poor Z
rah
/me is Z
Ffffs
XD
screw it im getting drunk on cider
epic!
What was the movie last night with racers. it was red something...
that is interesting XD
/me is a spider
/me uses undo spray
cant drink beer well cider is the next best thing
Quick_Thinker: add some tequila why don't you
I'd like more Mare-do-Well art to exist because
/me killed Z yesterday
It's based off an old...people had an argument about humanizations awhile back on Tumblr and that stemmed from it
That sounds like Worf, yo. o_o
#derpy_hooves is busted
I guarrentee it will be an extreamly controversial image though, medacris
/me wonders why so much /me today >_>
so did i:D
/me made out with Z
im not adding any thing becasue my parents dont know that most cider has a trace of alchoal in it thats why im allowed to drink it
but it does personify the spirit of the fandom well
/me is fun to use :3
CrystalPhoenix: Makes me wonder if the number of Bronies has surpassed the furries. The furry fandom has some people that have gone a little crazy.
Quick_Thinker you suave individual
/me uses undo spray
there. now 300 is broken
It does. But if it's controversial you don't have to do it
also it tastes pretty damn god
Rex_Mundi Theres no real number but it should be around 1-2 million
Rex_Mundi, remember that some Bronies are furries
all fandoms have people who are crazy
Well the furrie community was ruined thanks to CSI, right?
11,01Didn't think we watched a movie with racers.
how did CSI ruin them>
/me undid Z s undo spray
All humanity has some humans who are crazy as fluff.
Nyra That and really really bad reportage on them
If you know Cybersix, that's how I imagine Human!Mare Do Well
08,01and Vanity Fair
Look it's SerenaMidori's picture: tmblr.co/ZfOqpvXVExi1
the crystal fair
Nyra Most press has smeared them and ruined their reputation
Dont you remember the furry based episode, that made them look like all they wanted to do was get into their suits and yiff.
08,01most furries are awesome
^^
Quick_Thinker think it was that episode with second life
08,01it's the minority who give them the bad name
/me destroyd rarity chat.
play 20 questions
wait. furries? god i remember them. thank god i ditched em
Therefore, really looking within any group and comparing members to members is a really... very old has-been-done thing.
we used to do that earlier
/me is yiff.
Minority usually screams the loudest
well you know what they say about geniuses? all geneus have to have some form of intsanity
I spy a SNOWPONY
Nyra: That was do to Chewfox going on the Tyra banks show and giving the telivision viewing public the idea that Furries are all fursuit fetishists who believe they have animal souls.
its true
I spy
something something something
/me smokes yiff.
canada_brony is furry
08,01Vivix: aye; empty vessels make th emost noise
/me nods
http://t.co/xZ2TAPjL <----- Pinkie Pie Eating a Jelly Bean.
is that tentacle gun
Z is brother
Rex Mundi, that episode was before Chewfox.
Yeeears before.
yiff is some fucked up shit
Even so, its a shame how someone elses ignorance can lead to such desacration.
do it!
08,01jelonheoh: how?
true
But there were some great fursuits in that episode XD the 'roo was cute, with the ski goggles.
ya.
if you knew the things ive seen *Proccedes to cry in corner*
08,01personally, i have nothing against yiff or clop, and don't see how either is a bad thing
Are disk one shots?
ninja tron
question: does anyone of you know the band :"TOCOTRONIC"?
There are some really good fursuits out there, of course the best ones aren't really made for lovin'
6_9
True.
nice, my father's a vet
In moderation, it is a healthy expression of curiousity and sexuality
08,01jelonheoh: trust me, honey, i've certainly seen worse
/me is not a furry, but accepts them and yiff.
most likely
jelonheoh, I've ventured deep in place far beyond your imagination
FiK brown branch
Hello :/
/me doesnt think furries are that bad
Ohai CCCP
/me sighs, old talk is old ____--____
I read a book with a character named Filomena and I "wat'-ed hard
Hi CCCP :)
what game is this?
adventure music is adventurey
Yello CCCP
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Saturday Merchandise: "So Much Merch" Edition
Hi AdamTheDuck thelonepony and Vivix
The suits themselves though, can be really awesome, but stupid expensive.
i try to accept everyone for what they do and who they are. i wont judge. but i wonder why
/me boobs
^
The really goods are crazy expensive- but like- movie quality
Any idea how to make a pony name?
hi otakon
/me 08,01bums
jelonheoh: good attitude to have
I try not to judge, but I'm an idiot sometimes too
jelonheoh Really? what you said kinda goes against what you jsut said
CrystalPhoenix i've pretty much talked to myself like a crazy mother fucker. How? Auspurgers its a nerocrotic disorder in my brain
trallite sprinkle
canada brony is lying
Mihoshika: Personality
And there was another character named Appolonia which could totally be a relative of Applejack
...
08,01otakon: i'll bum you.
the only time I really "wat"-ed hard was when Twilight said she has a brother. xD
I can't think of anything good though.
Although, I can't say much. I've spent $1500 on a halloween costume.
/me cringes
what does what i said contradict
Zis yiff.
08,01yiff is gak.
^
Anyone notice the music is the original tron theme
Mihoshika: For who? Or what? Or when?=
jelonheoh About saying yiff is fucked up
That was a little out of nowhere, but I do like Shining Armor
Z is yiff.
08,01shizumobile: i did!
:P
Woot!!!!!
Mihoshika: You want a name for who? Your OC, someone else OC etc?
but i didnt say i didnt tolerate it
My OC.
You can probably think something is creepy and weird without looking down on someone though
Star_Gazer: he's a six foot Indian Scotsman...
I pimped the stream on Tumblr
Mihoshika: Link it
No thanks :P
jelonheoh You made it seem negative as you said it. Which is my point
/me asks canada_brony what yiffs are
otakon: i know that
Mihoshika: Link to me in PM then :P
Don't ask.
i should have been more specific
Fffffs
08,01it comes from the planet of bum
:[
Well, I actually just lost it.
hehe
08,01it flies through the region of trousers
/me wonders why we are talking about yiff :'(
lol
Still would like the guidelines for making one.
08,01emitting a terribel hum.

WUT?!?!?!
^BOOYA!
http://i.imgur.com/8q6g5.jpg

Mihoshika: Your OC is you or a part of your or a new character you wish to create?
Um...
08,01Deacon: unknown; more research is required. care to help science?
dat music
I don't know what even to say anymore so...uhm.....
Question: Can you tell us interesting details about your favourite bands?
Have some cookies?
but Rammstein is very popular in germany too
Supposed to be my...
/me blows g4k
eh...
why did I hear the song Wok & Roll from the old racing game Powerslide all of a sudden?
They are?
D=
/me takes a cookie from AttackWithHugs
Omg

/me gives AttackWithHugs a muffin in return
lol
well alright then
Dub wubwubwubwwub
Mihoshika: Okay, what do you enjoy? Your Hobby, your passion?
/me eats the muffin
perfect time for an interruption
/me grabs a cookie
/me does not do yiff
so that happened
You're looking at it >.<
/me is a cookie
thanks AttackWithHugs ^_^
:'(
may i please have a muffin :3
Mihoshika: Tron?
/me is insane
Question: How do you learn to nail down the poses so well? Looking at animation walk cycles?
08,01i was actually having a conversation about zoophilia in another channel today
08,01but that's not really a good topic for in here
No, I don't have the stream even playing.
/me destroys all other chats whith minecraft T.N.T
its very annoying not being able to tell people im a brony
Mihoshika: What do you find interesting that's NOT ponies?
Truth.
/me wants moar ponies
BronyState, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the USS Bronyprise. Their mission: to explore strange new fandoms. To seek out new life and new yiff. To boldly go where nopony has gone before. Sorry for really bad Star Trek reference.
Music, I suppose.
It's a flammable topic, yeah
Mihoshika: Create or listening?
Did someone reqest some ponies? .-.
I need to learn to shade too
ahhh shit
YAY NEW YIFF
Listening, a little bit of playing.
Hello guests!
ya
Mihoshika: Hmmm..
YIFFTASTIC!
08,01okay children, that's enough yiff for today.
Question to potentially fill some time: Have you ever watched Darkwing Duck and if so what do you remember about it.
I've also watch a ton of anime ^_^
No.
One of the reasons I wanted to explore psychology, ah well
I remember Launchpad and Gosalyn
oh yea darkwing duck
next time on: that weird chat! we discuss *insert topic here*
Mihoshika: If we had an image of your OC we could come up names easier :P
Perry~ Go make a pot of tea! You need the caffeine for the stream!
bronies are yiff>_>
can we talk about how awesome Cuba is?
I am out of tea
The Kernal
HA!
cubes are cool
now THAT is a pun
I'd rather make the OC after I get a name and cutiemark.
I can't be out of tea :U
Canada_Brony: /)_-
CCCP ah, something that's non-russian is catching your eye?
i wonder why almost every shooter has the enemy dipicted as russians
00,02oh
So since you guys can see the alerts
00,02Zacklego, redline
*looks at the 23 bags I bought recently*
And I hope to make the cutie mark based on the name.
Watch for marathon references
00,02Nittany_Discord, it was shown a few hours before the episode
08,01otakon: *Kernel
too many russianss
08,01as in core
Mihoshika: Try and draw it first then come up with names, much easier then other way around
11,01Oh OK.
It was a very good movie
Deacon well I mean Fidel Castro is an pretty awesome guy...
I don't trace. I need to study from life more though, I use google and anatomy studies
(chants saying "PONIES PONIES CIDER PONIES...")
bllllllllllllehhhhhahhhhhhhhhhauuuuuuuuuuu
I'm horrible with drawing though x_X
His name will be Squigles. He has an afro. He shoots pixie dust out of his bung-hole. RC reference. Lol

Ponies are very different than real horses sometimes tho
That's actually good, imo...

Ahhh I get it
08,01to ponies "bunghole in a barrel" must have a completely different meaning
tron
wahuh?
Mihoshika: Not even close...
out of his bang hole
Better than I could ever do ^_^
Mihoshika: But try it out. :P my Pony full name is Vortexual Paradox, or simply, Vordox.
I started that a bit
Mihoshika: Got it while drawing him

Okay!

Nyra: Create one
08,01Deacon: barrel is a part of a pony
BARRELS
How?
08,01don't make me play the song
Mihoshika: If you're unsure, use the pony creator as a first draft
Somebody needs earphones
(I am)
He caused a time loop
Nyra: Use Pony Creator as first draft
sonnova barrel
Mihoshika: Great! Keep looking!
Pony Creator?
uber
here's a question: what is the hardest piece of art have you ever done?
uber
i dont have an OC but it always seems like he will excist no matter what i mean come on its the name Quick Thinker it can be imagined what he looks like
creator*
/me says "there is to much g@k here
I had one made, but lost it due to accidently going back a page.
Quick_Thinker: Not really. :P
Theory: Most male ponies are pegusi
Mine are Polythemus
See, Mihoshika , find a name you REALLY like from things you enjoy
08,01Nyra: i've reared Polyphemus moths
who here is a bro
That's hard to do with English.
Really?
If you get Illustrator, it's worth it to vector
Canada_Brony does having sisters count?
yeah Quick Thinker...cause its always fun to think quickly
TOO MUCH GREEN STUFF HERE.
08,01i've reared POlyphemus, Cecropia, and Rothschild Atlas
Quick_Thinker: Sadly, don't get a proper image of you as Ponysona
f**k the police
08,01i looooove moths
i used to use so many nicknames on games and sites. i only go by jelonheoh and Atomic Tank now.
Just got here and DUBSTEP ALL UP IN THIS BITCH
F*** tron
Cool. I only found the Polyphemus on my doorstep. And I foolishly named her Poly.
/me can use /me
A-thank-ya
Moth's are probably the prettiest of the flying-insects
dubstep? where?
Mihoshika: Try to find something you REALLY like that describes you, and then use that, or go through it a few times and find a better nae
I would not have the patience for that
Dikdik
TIINY little bastards with anime eyes
I'd do that, but again, I can't find an English name that sounds appropriate.
/me is a pork
Mihoshika: Find your passion first. ;)
maggots are best insects

Can somepony link me Pony Creator?
i am skrillex
Vivix a doe?
i died
I was gone for a little bit because i had to restaert my computer. Anyways, I was going to say that after chewfox went on tv, her FA account was filled with so much hate mail it crashed the site, the power of hate essentially did an accidental DOS attack on Furaffinity.
Canada_Brony: then you suck ass
does are Cervines, it's--more related to antelopes and such
Question: What is your favorite mediums to draw with?
SKRELLEY DED

Someone I knew did a prank on someone, gave them stale juice and soda and said it was alcoholic- she got piss drunk on nothing
yiff.exe
sherry- I don't drink, but- if I do, I want it to taste nice
Question: How often do you use the undo function now and how often did you use it when you started drawing digitally?
Canada_Brony: ...
and some sherry-flavoured candy things have been kinda nice-
Vivix same here Vivix
Did you catch it

Effects of alcohol is more dammaging on a growing mind

how damaging is--hard to say
Hello then, RainbowSwag. :3
TheArbiter264: if you dont like stream, go watch some youtube videos for a bit
Hiya, Yavos. What's going on?
plus im running out of hard and will eventually have to go to apple
I don't think it is very damaging at all, but pscyhologically, your relationship with intoxication changes
08,01Drunk_jelonheoh: funny you should say that; i have once slept with a policeman
OH NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
double da ZZ
It's a 24 hour artist stream
Well, there are 5 artists drawing for charity right now.
Canada_Brony the "Theatres" don't make any difference in the mane chat. When Movie Night starts up, each theatre leads you to both the mane chat and pony-named siderooms so #bronystate doesn't get overwhelmed with a couple hundred users.
he got 4chand
BUCK
thelonepony:why
Awesome
TheArbiter264: not sure
I turned on monitoring in this channel, so stats will be generated for it now
the hell was that C brony?

Zacklego On the mane channel it's not allowed theres actually channels dedicated to it on the network
oh oka
cachi01 When was the last time you read how to play a game? Never
fun
I read the instruction manuals on games
I guess that makes sense
Zacklego but.... I like reading manuals :(
me and ZZZ live in the same house
Zacklego: yeah. but you need to read the rules of a community
i burn them for wood
Zacklego: if you want to stay in it
read the instruction manual for X-COM that shits hard to install
I wouldn't mind seeing MLP versions of famous horses, like Black Beauty, Ginger, National Velvet, Misty of Chincoteague, and Khartoum
Zacklego: so go read the bronystate rules
i know everything ZZZ is doing.
crepp
Canada_Brony is he being a silly pony?
Question: Can I dare one of you to make a drawing in MS Paint?
Hey everypony. I created my OC but how do I save it?

hi Nyra

Willkommen Gabby! :)
Lol, yaya
KK guys. I made the OC but how do I make its cutie mark
Canadian_Brony Neva.
Fun fact: apples contain a very weak poison. so eating lots of them but LOTSLOTSLOTS of them = ded
You will suffer from the pings.

Ponybean: NO NACHOS? RUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN
Canadian_Brony: Turns out I just performed a world premiere of a piece "Alien Jelly Monsters from the Depths of Uranus" at my All-County festival
Oh wait
Time Turner's name makes him not only a Whovian, but a Harry Potter fan
08,01DashWithRainbows: soemthing like that, aye

Tiny Tina could be a crazy Pinkie
Borderlands 2 in MLP?
Okay guys. I believe I am headin' off. Have to get up early and talk legal bs with Hasbro tomorrow morning.
the north won the war by promising to give chickens to the slaughter
Interesting
08,01Jelonheoh: i enjoyed it
Jelonheoh: its one of my fve fics :)
08,01i'm not really one for gluefics in general
i cant get the last part of it out of my head
08,01but i did like it
CCCP: You can if you want to... but its obviously a political mouthpice from a person that thinks Charity is bad, religion is bad, capitalism is good.
gotta love that you have beautiful eyes ending
Jelonheoh: i found it good :)
Sb!
08,01even though it's not really very well written either...
question: how did you get into My little pony?
neither was cupcakes
Canadian_Brony: It turns out it was a real deal (sort of): http://strangestuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/AJM_poster_art_v1_sm1.jpg
hasbro is attacking its fans?!
a wild Panda-2 has appeard :O
Ponybean: Hasbro is what now?
Question: If you were Santa. What would you bring to children besides toys?
Jelonheoh: cupcakes was meh. but its good to scare newbies in the fandom :D
08,01oh Ayn Rand...
Rex_Mundi well i think i might read it anyway even if i have conflicting views just because im really bored.
I guess it's same as how I thouht cupcakes was good, but was horrified by it
Ohai Panda-2! :)
No. I have been given the official sanctioned okay from Hasbro to produce the first full-length animated film for the series.
I was absoluteliy horrified, not by the gore, but the dialog and motivation
ABOARD THE FAUSTICORN!
ooh but not the thirs?
cachi01: when i got in the fandom, i read cupcakes at first. i found it meh
third*
Jelonheoh if you're talking about the fan-fic, it's surprisingly well done. I'm not saying all gore-fics are bad, but the author doesn't treat it like a gore fic made purely for gore, which is why I could read that and not "Cupcakes". I don't even consider that a story.
SerenaMidori: I'm adoring you for girlscout cookies. .~.
I love Thin Mints
08,01i found cupcakes an hilarious read
thelonepony: cupcakes and the movs introduced me to the fandom
cachi01: but the video :D
;__;
11,02Panda-2!
Thin mints! Yes! Yes yes yes!
:|+:'(=:[
08,01because it's just so over the top
Jelonheoh as for the song, well, it's Glaze. What do you expect?
I thought it was sad because it reminded me of so many real things
ABOARD THE FAUSTICORN!
i love the song
like how, even if RD had been let go, she would neer have been fine
Sb! Wanna play SSBB??
and the "sequel" awoken
ZALLL ABOURD THE DRUNK CIDER TRAIN CHUG CHUG
not when Pinke had gone that far- and it just rmeinded me of how--it can be
thelonepony: i love the cupcakes HD vid
11,02Panda: O3O Okies, but first I gotta walk mah doggeh o3o
SuperBrony64, i have a hug, and its aching to meet you
08,01DerpyMuffins: i didn't find the gore all that bad, to be honest. it could have been a lot worse
11,02D:
Lyra`!!!
/me hugs Lyra`
damn, the crazy-face was funny.
/me Huggles Panda-2 :3
/me huggles SuperBrony64
/me glomps Lyra`
Jelonheoh: which one of all? rocket to insanity?
oh hai panda
Cupcakes was a badly written story im afriad if there is going to become a populare dark fan fic then it should be at least well written.
DEEEAAUUUGH
CCCP: There are better things to do if you are bored. Heck, if you like History, then buy Rome Total War, then download the Europa Barbarorum mod for it.
i wonder if anyone tried to create pinkies cherry changa
Thin Mint would be a good theme for a fanpony
Ponies47! How is you!
08,01CCCP: example?
I have no idea if Jan has a dA account, but I'm sure eXe does. xD
Hai Ponies47
im drunk on cider Panda-2 how are u
08,01of a well-written gluefic
I've seen it online, the cherry changa
+know
looked good.
There you are Lyra` been wondering where you were
i only remember listening to rainbow factor and awoken. then i put them on loop
Panda-2: I is good! Also I bucked up with the date of my birthday! It's less then 3 weeks away. God I'm terrible at math! But, how are you? :3
ive been Roseluck` for about a month
08,01Cupcakes wasn't all that badly written
however, I'd rather someone make her cake
>says its bad
thelonepony::|+:'(=:[
he has an DA but he dosn't upload mlp stuff there

Do you guys watch MLP YTP's?
08,01Panda-2: allowed to mention it; not allowed to discuss the gore aspect of it

Oh you money?
Oh crap!
I don't get you The_Browncoat.

Night Nittany_Discord :)
I just realized that I have to still fax the liscense agreement back to Hasbro tonight.
The biggest problem with cupcakes is it tries to shock the veiwer in a time when people can see ten times more fucked up things if they really felt like it. Shock humor doesnt work anymore.
im thinking should i sleep orrrrrr play SSBB with SuperBrony64?
Only 14 people donated? I have to change that now, even if I wanted to wait until afternoon. :|
CCCP: yeah but its as overrated as MLD
night Nittany_Discord
orrrr drunk more cider and then play
cachi01 at least MLD had some redeeming qualities
08,01Jelonheoh: we post up the lotto on Monday
im to young for cider
unlike my speelewerfing
Been drinking Lyra`?
spelling*
08,01once it's up, go here: http://survey.bronystate.net/
I think the fanfic with Lyra and the human is far more disturbing than Cupcakes, because cupcakes tries too hard.
Jelonheoh: It's pretty straightforward: you're sent a link to a survey. You fill it out. The entries are chosen at random each week.
thelonepony:6_9+:P=:D
so am i Ponybean but i have parents that dont know hard cider has alchoal in it
08,01Rex_Mundi: yes

I like Small Horse Friends Are Good in terms of YTP
08,01cachi01: about 9
The Hasbro sanctioned movie I'm producing.
08,01it's just way OTT

08,01it's gore and shock for the sake of gore and shock
Nyra: what????
http://images.4chan.org/wsg/src/1352578827458.gif
cachi01 what's SAM?
Canadian_Brony: Yeah, "Good girl", thats the one. Even worse because the gif was on on Equestria Daily and most people found it "cute". I however, without knowing about the fanfic at the time knew what was happening.
08,01it's like a 12 year old writing
IKR
cachi01 wait, nevermind.
I'll type it in large print.
Ponybean Alcohol is pretty overrated, btw.

Jelonheoh: they changed the story a bit
Rex_Mundi: :3
they will*
08,01what do you mean by sanctioning?
Me and my brony friends tuned into your show all the time

Heyo
Currently everything will be helpful. The only thing that I can do myself is a pretty good Diamond Dog voice, thats about it. AlienWarhead is on board, hes gonna play Big Mac.
Nyra: Get Rina for Twilight?
I think the way magic works in MLP is that anypony can do potions, but only unicorns and alicorns can teleport and summon things, etc.
no
dont
not her
no
how long is the request list? o ,o
we need some new talent
^
someone else to try to sine

Bree for Fluttershy and Pinkie?
what exactly are you looking for?
Nyra: get alioopster!
Or the cast of FiW
hey, hangman
J_E for the last time give someone like a rising VA a chance
If anyone is interested in joining up, I will be creating a Casting Call video for both my Youtube account and have it posted by EQD, they've already agreed to do it.
I wish I could contribute something but I don't play any instruments and my singing has degraded over the years.
stop playing favorites in the fandom
Start with R S T L N E
I also plan on making a Blogger page, similar to Children of the Night, and a FB page.
Writing is defenitely not my thing, as much as I'd like it to be and I can't do an impression if my life depended on it.
Ponies are cuddly
Yay! Seems like it finally let me donate.

Nyra: I could possibly do some VA, but I've no idea how busy I'll be.
08,01not fantastic, but not bad either
cachi01: I play piano
TROctavia: /)
Question: What would you make for a MLP-themed meal?

08,01TROctavia: you're my white twin
Nyra: What exactly is your project going to be?
Tristra - Answer: No Sockes, let see them hooves!
a fan made mlp thing
Jelonheoh, the question is, what can everyone provide? .-.
The first ever fan-made Full length animated feature film.
not really any specifics were given to us
lol Tristra XD
well Adam can provide a duck
:3
i can provide trolling
^
Oh, I suppose I could do a bit of script writing as well. Again, not sure how busy I'd be.
well actually i have tried drawning but im not the greatest at it
08,01TROctavia: what's your favourite piece in your repertoire on the cello?
i could do possible VA
Tristra also said Answer: A haysandwich with Haybacon Strips

Nyra: So, 90 mins or thereabouts?

08,01TROctavia: oh awesome! you are certainly a person of good taste!
Jelonheoh: with a side of tequila and old whiskey

Did I just kick myself?

HAY GYUS
cachi01: hired!

What game?
I cans till hear you
hi Rustymeat :) call of honor: modern battlefield 39
08,01though i've only learned half of the Elgar so far
im bak...*hic*
I'd add chocolate milk, chimicherrychanga (cherry turnover?), apple pie, and cider.
cashioweone pls ur ar dolan
my favorite cello piece would probably be Ave Maria
Anyways, I truly need to sleep now
Hi Rustymeat :)
Peace

Nyra: Have you ever produced any animation?

Ohai Rustymeat

Perfect pitch, yes. haha
dat lightcycle
No animation, but I have produced a live-action film based on my published work.
ded
08,01TROctavia: i don't have reliable perfect pitch
08,01but i do have fairly good relative pitch
Nyra: Then please take some advice: start off by seeing if you can do a short before you try to do a movie.
what is defined as perfect pitch?
I followed you all on A
dA
Nyra: Find your animators and artists and then plan out some about 4 minutes long.
Request drawing: Draw a pony with Goggles
Quick_Thinker: Being able to distinguish notes and their names from hearing them
^
wait that
i am able to do taht
As am I.
^
same here
AJIsAwesome!!!!
08,01i can't really do the note names, but i can generally play them by ear on the piano and cello
so if you played an Ab 6, i'd tell you it's an Ab 6
What do you think about the shipping between Derpy and Dr Whooves?
AYJAY
In fact, I didn't know I had it until 8th grade. :D
oh gosh. we have all been spamming nyra.
cant remember all the names of notes but i know most of them
thelonepony!
cachi01
Nyra: Do you have an idea for the story?
08,01TROctavia: it's so fun!
that legion of doom
when that's done, it's going to look good
fission mailled
what happen man? you went full stone for like 8 hours?
woah, which game is this?
pime taradox
Yea. I have the entire screenplay written out. Though it is open to discussion for possible changes and tweaks. Also I need to find animators.
Oh, sorry thelonepony.
looks fun^^
That can wwork in Flash.
fuck it im going to try my hand at animating
thelonepony: I fell asleep for the past 8+ hours. :$
Nyra: i wonder if the guys of double rainboom would like to help.
By accident.
AJIsAwesome: :D
Nyra: what animators do you have in mind?
Anyone here watch fringe?
I want it to look identical to show.
08,01TROctavia: awesome! a few days ago i was really stressed, and unwound by figuring out Gangnam Style on the piano
08,01it's like doing a puzzle
......
Ive already e-mailed the guys over at DR, but no reply.
brb
tryind to do that
08,01TROctavia: are you in the UK? if so, we should meet up and jam
Nyra: Then try doing a test film, first. It can be a series of scenes set to music or one scene with dialogue and effects, but just see if you can do that.
Nyra do you have any old works?
wow i got the first part already o_o
08,01aw
and im in Indiana
the middle of freakn nowehre
08,01TROctavia: oh! does your cello have a name?
I'll try Doc. Its just that I cant really do anything. I'm just the director/idea guy type. I would need somepony to creat the short.
God the voice acting
Yes, Crystal.
08,01mine's called Dave
I have a live-action film based on my published novel.
Dave the cello
nice lol
Nyra: nice!
nyra: link to one of youe projects by chance?

go home Drunk_Jelonheoh you are drunkl
Man, y'all are STILL Tronning?? 6_9
Anyone know Twilight's favorite color?
hi
:P
08,01the type who would take up the cello / is doubtless a sensitive fellow / and much more refined / than brass who're inclined / to be boozers who banter and bellow
DerpyMuffins: Banana
Unfortunatley, the video was lost on a flash drive, which I cannot find. The film was made over 6 years ago.
cello and synth go well together
Nyra: I'm not trying to dissuade you, just trying to give you a reality check on just how huge this project is.
Banana?
Seriously
ATC does :p
I only had for personal enjoyment with my friends we never posted it.
cashioweone is always srs
Nyra: do a creepypast about that! lol no seriously i've read dozens of creepypastas like that lol
It was kinda lame, but good story.
Nyra: You essentially need to build a production team. And the problem is that few people want to devote that much work to something for free.
DerpyMuffins: yes srs
cool
I wouldn't be suprised if somebody had a recipe for all that stuff already
No one knows Twilight's favorite color?
DerpyMuffins: BANANA
pink
Nyra, DocSane, you should talk to Snapai, you guys made me think of him
??
Nyra: That guy who did the Picture Perfect Pony video took about 40 days to make that video.
im writing a project up right now as well actually. when i say project i mean it can be anything from a story to an animation. in this case a story
Let's crash a server!
Oh thats just it though Doc. I'm paying everyone involved with the project.
DerpyMuffins: nah im kidding. its mayonaise
08,01shizumobile: okay!

cachi01: :D
/me is waiting for server to crash :D
which server, the one in the game?
Nice thing about using Flash is that there are a TON of fan-made assets and vectors already available.
08,01thelonepony: i'm not really going to crash our server
i know :P
i cant believe i never bothered to ask how to put text in ittalic
Exactly, thats why I want to sue it.

I keep hoping Feasts of Fiction will do MLP eventually
Yes it Got Leaked
08,01weeping_pegasi82: i was logged into the wrong machine!
jezebel: well they lied to you
08,01rather, i had switched to the wrong terminal
:/
jezebel: i think they ment Episode 3 man
meant*
:$
The third episode leaked before it aired
on itunes
and its not called leaked if it was released after the premiere -_-'
just watch next friday episode 4 will be on itunes before tv
so it leaked or what? i'm getting mixed messages
I hope they add more green ponies in canon because I really like green and it isn't used enough
So yea, Doc. I know how daunting of a project this is, but even still though, your right. I should release a teaser before starting full production.
jezebel: which episode are you talking about?
Thanks for advice.
Question: what were your first thoughts when you found out about bronies?
I was just told that next episode
-_-'
!cd
Episode 4 of season 3 "One Bad Apple" airs in 6 days, 10 hours, 52 minutes, 16 seconds (Nov 24 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
Oh AJ episode is next :)
Nyra even there, very few people would be willing to join due to your lack of works
jezebel: I watched this episode at 9:30 local time (EST)
Rustymeat: nope
Rustymeat: actually nopé
Rustymeat: cmc
It's ok. You don't have to
Applebuck Season
not saying it's impossible but it'll be hard to assemble a team
Especially if you think it'll be offensiv-- oh
the suspense of what twilight is destined for it going to kill me!
True.
I have time, it's 11:30 here
Jelonheoh: use the pony destiny generator!
I think she's in europe
so it's horrible late there
I have to go to bed :(
Its a shame we live in such sceptical times and nopony is willing to take a leap of faith nowadays.
cachi01: that was a blast :D
that gadget is really amusing
On what Nyra?
its awesome lol
Lunar_Eclipsed: sleep is for the weak!
The film I'm producing.

It'd be How To Train Your Dragon minus the fear part
OOH.
I have been up for 20 hours so I have to
I wish I could Flash
I'm pretty sure thats what the show used right?
i think so
Well I can, at the most excruciatingly primitive level. v_v

Yes

Crystal does make a pretty good point though, this will be my first online released film I'm creating. People might be weary.
Also, Nyra, if you need a violist, my non-brony buddy is 1st chair philharmonic for the Manhattan school of music pre-college and im sure he's be willing to help in that regard :x
We love you perry
08,01Kurra: there's pretty much nothing up in there, except for a galerry full of anthro insect porn
08,01cachi01: yup

....
I think real-life icky muffins could work if you use gummi worms
Use the dovahkiin helmet!

Thank-you TROctavia. That would be great.

BRB
Meany.

oh man the new onies are in for a rough ride
13You should know better.
cachi01 what was that? hidden knife you say?
13That's fucking disgusting and you know it.
Is it over?
I should, but common sense doesn't really seem to set in.
13Then maybe I should just ban you now?
For what?
AJIsAwesome, touché
/me sighs
I haven't done anything.... yet...
Mihoshika: we saw what you did.
/me has a rape face
Mihoshika: you use that word
They made it work, if he's older of course he couldn't go to her first day of school
I didn't do anything other than say what I was pondering about.
Jelonheoh: you'll get the same too, using that word.
^
^^
:S
what happened? somebody piss off someone and call down the thunder?
Mihoshika: ever consider some words aren't worth pondering or mentioning?
13How old are you people, six?
Buytoast: seems like it
5 actually.
13On what planet is joking about that shit acceptable.
Not really.
let me guess
/me is 12 >_>
im 999 john madden
/me kicks AdamTheDuck out :I
AdamTheDuck, you seem to have a fascination with knives. Collector?
Shizu, I live in a screwed up community.
Ok, I'll be serious now. :/
if you are 999 them im john madden
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
probably should restore order in this cha room
Mihoshika: Did you read the rules when you came here?
13That doesn't make it okay.
the Moonbase alpha Anthem
Hoi!
"Is it all a joke to you"~JonTron
I've read the rules over twice, can't remember them.
Maybe it was more of a skimming, though.
13That's no excuse.
AdamTheDuck, I've never seen Alice before.
slipknot ftw :I
Mihoshika: Perhaps you should revisit them. They are the rules. They exist for a reason.
Although, chats are generally all following the same guidelines.
No.
every chat is diffrent
What you said, without question, was unacceptable.
Question: Do you think Crystal Ponies will play a bigger role in on coming episode? I mean thats an entire city with alot of history.
Nah some have different standards
No spamming, no cursing, no racism, no fun stuff.
tbh i dont remember no rape jokes being in the rules, i even remember saying that if its bannable then it should be
Funny context is funny context.
oh boy
No spoiling in this one for example
Mihoshika: implying this cht isnt fun
i didnt read the rules for months.
OMG, you are actually making animations?
Never said that.
13There is no context in which rape is funny. End of discussion.
I don't understand why they made Celestia pink as a toy
^
^^
^^^
I don't want spoilers
^^^^
What if it's a pineapple.
^^6
The mods keeps saying to cut out rape jokes everytime they are brought up Mihoshika
I haven't seen the premiere yet shhh
C-C-C-Combo BRAAAKEEEER
I know ^_^
I usually am the one who brings them up.
You know what I lack?
Mihoshika: So if you know, you make the joke anyway? Even knowing its wrong?
Gills?
blood?
......
A snack drawer
Well, it's not that it's wrong. It's that the moderator doesn't like it.
Like, I have no snacks stashed in my room
shit's nasty man
OK, i come back and now the topic is rape jokes?
AttackWithHugs, it broke my heart when I found out you couldn't buy replicas in Australia because of customs and laws. ;~; http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/17ivxp1caxjcbjpg/original.jpg
you gets crumbs in there
then you get ants
He blew up but sombra was also a shadow, and he could regenerate body parts (ie horn)
cool I can chat again.
Mihoshika: Its not wrong. You're kidding me. Please. Tell me you're kidding.
13Did you seriously just suggest that rape is not wrong?
and ants are nasty little buggers
Depends on the situation.
Hi Tsitra
:S
I must've missed that sent...pfffffffffft.
13No it doesn't.
Yeah it does.
Shizuka: I leave him to you. I'm done here.
Rex_Mundi: Sadly, but this ought to be cleared in a sec...hopefully
AttackWithHugs, and here's the knife in screenshots if you want to see it. http://nerdeux.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/alice-review-04.jpg
AdamTheDuck, that's a huge knife. It's nice, though.
inb4 ban
The one piece to reform thing is legit. His horn grew back from his head, so why not his everything from his horn?
would people please try to solve this in a calm orderl manner?
i believe he meant that the jokes arent wrong
Depends, what's an orderl.
I take girls getting raped seriously. Guys, not so much, unless by another guy.
but seriously, why is it not in the rules yet if its bannable
i messed up...orderly*
Too bad Octavia isn't a violin player or I'd make a fiddler on the roof joke
Mihoshika: double standard
Hmm?
wat.
cachi01, too bad the new one wasn't as good as I wanted it to be. /)
AdamTheDuck, what platform(s) is it for? Not like I have any money to buy it.
wat is happen now
Mihoshika Rape is rape it means forced sex which is hurting someone so no
Yeah this is going to be about as calm and orderly as a pub fight.
Actually
AdamTheDuck: ikr (\ it ws good anyway :)
AttackWithHugs, console and PC
13Not going to bother.
Mihoshika: that sounds a little feminist
anyway i still feel guilty so i appologize for all inappropriate behaviour on my part in the last 48 hours
I don't get that fiddler on the roof joke
Mihoshika Without consent means hurting them emotionally
/me facepalms hard
BlaxBlain: not so much feminist as ignorant, just not knowing the cases of homosexal rape
Shizuka: Dang it, hate when this happens
Not if they lack emotions.
Mihoshika: Only in the world of anime porn
Sometimes I feel like chat is boring nowadays, and then stuff like this happens.
....
tentacles
homosexal
My day is made.
The correct term is hentai.
Domo!
silly Mihoshika, your opinion is wrong and i hope that karma comes to bite you in the ass
that sounds like a Latin shape
cachi01: Ohai ouo~
Actually, I have no arse.
Ohai Domo :)
Midnight_Stormwing: so what, youre wishing it to him now? thats not right either
Mihoshika: how do you poop?
Well they said roof on the roof so I thought of Fiddler on The Roof
thelonepony: Hey there! ^^
No meat on my rear end.
howdy Domo
twilight_sprinkle, misping?
Season finae?
Question: Should we get more ponies with sideburns?
Ohai Domo
I have an anus, no arse.
/me waves ouo
*facepalms*
If you read the technical description, it is correct, that's why it's a broad term also used to describe animal behaviour
AttackWithHugs: no, im referring to the kara thing
:S
Flashback with new lines :|
twilight_sprinkle, ooh okay then
I hate those
*hugs AJIsAwesome*
welp gonna go afk for a bit
Well, I have an artificial arse.
/me hugs Rex_Mundi back

Don't argue Vivix, you'll be next.

AJIsAwesome nothing, just being silly :3
You may now appeal your ban, with THE POWER OF BRONYSTATE@GMAIL.COM!
Ok. :3
It's a done topic, whatever
Vivix you seem to be under the impression that your logic will save you.
NOW I know why I downloaded IE9
I'm 12 and what is this?
THE POWER OF THE MODS COMPELS YOU
I have no logic
¬_¬
logic is forbidden
im something and what is 12?
same with opinions
IE9... wut
logic?
For Tumblr, because Firefox won't let me log in
you people should know this by now
Hehe
Write that down in the rules.
......
Even with correct username/password and clearing cache
should i continue my corpse party adventure
or do another thing...
cachi01: you should
Whatever floats your boat.
but it is a bit, bitter
\:3/
Speaking of party, the Balloon Party bandcamp page seems like it's gone
finally beat halo 4 :$
So Shizuka is that it for you now then? Thanks for Tron if you're not going to continue
Great!
It suprises me how nice some things can look when done on paint
And After Party isn't on there, either. So I had to end up torrenting BP
now i need to buy halo 4
AttackWithHugs: its bad
AttackWithHugs: only 3 good songs in it
AttackWithHugs: Rejected, loco and this monster in me
BlaxBlain, it was good, playing co-op with friend made it moar enjoyable
I like Boooring! and Cawtion
I thought i was the only one who liked that one. :D
AJIsAwesome, sci is awesome isn't he?
AttackWithHugs: Eeyup.
so has anybody read a broken bond?

/me pulls out 50 different grey paint pallates and reads them "Am I doing it right, Meanwhile?"
it being narrated by gilbert gottfried is funnier

My sister was in a bookshop, and she saw some old guy wiht his daughter and he pointed to 50 shades of gray and said "How about this one? Looks ok"
Just refreshed and nothiing
Obviously, nothing can save it, but at the very least you can turn it into a comedy.
Vivix: ..........
