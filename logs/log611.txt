But anyways, since I didn't get to say this during the Ridiculously long credits and list of fan club members, I'd like to thank ypu mods for putting on a hell of a show this summer with all these trilogies. It's been a whole lot of fun.
I hate how they did this because they never show people in paintball goggles.
Why are they so old if they go to university?
they're getting along?
dat short ass message
donald glover
Is Ahbed the Dwight of this series?

Dari: a community college is normally a place for either people who plan on transfering to a better school, or people who never got a chance when they were young

did someone say panic?
it's because no one cares when you don't have color :P
^
omg no stream everypony PANIC!
:3
CrimsonPhoenix: Why is there a dead pony in the backround?
/me noms on Caramel
Mind you, the average schmuck doesn't care even if you do have colour.
Kawaii_icybeauti, she's exhausted?
and what Meanwhile
what Meanwhile said**
/me 4,12 You're all average schmucks.
Mmmm Caramel apples
CrimsonPhoenix: And there's a dude doing a backbend.....But it's funny
/me shrugpony.
See.
Kawaii_icybeauti, dude?
Meanwhile.. in the chat
CrimsonPhoenix: :D
hmmm
Meanwhile: not a bad color combo
What's this Caramel?
Oh

Spidertext.
It's SRW
...
YAY!
oh snap
SRW!
http://cheezburger.com/6475891200
Would, but you forget otakon, I'm magic.

But I kind of like it.
WUBA DUB DUB DUB MOTHER*SQUEE*

is frustrated by stream hiccups and damn kicks
what else is new
:P
I SEE TETSUJIN 28!
hi
wait...haven't you done this one already Caramel?
What was with that little colours shenanigan there, Meanwhile?
hiya LoGaN
Making a point.
LoGaN: I see your 24 hour ban is up, that's good.
*cough*exploit*cough*
otakon: nope
....
crap
And yeah that particular method is an exploit but the point was that people don't read.
Hiya LoGaN
Exploit?
Ohai
otakon: wat?
argh more lag
pew pew pew
nvm
Ordinarily I'd have triggered the "Colours are for mods" kick script.
I'm well familiar with that one.
otakon: i was only banned for 2 hours and that was 5 moths ago
So why didn't you?
Because I'm magic.
So I just saw the odd life of timothy green. AWESOME POSSUMS! U guys should check it out.
LoGaN: but what about the 24 hour ban you just got the other day?
...
kirz why didn't he trigger the kickscript?
Did any1 else see the movie?
Shizuka: how is that spamming?
current scripts being used don't check /me messages
Go ahead
..
Damn.....son.
pew peww pew
...Huh.
I'd tell you but I don't really want to be responsible for spreading How-to's on avoiding chat rules.
but if you do it and it's noticed you'll get kicked manually
Cute robots
the fuck am i looking at?
Seems kirz is fine with it though. ^^
Colt_magnum: I missed
Well, there's the manual fallback.
<--not a mod any more :P
Male?
That's kind of why we have mods to begin with.
Major: he's a smarmy brit that LOVES Matt Smith
:O DR WHOOF
What does that question even mean? :P
otakon aw thats too bad. :/ I just saw it today and its a pretty nice movie.
:P
I'm just explaining why it didn't kick
Dari: you sure about that? :P
sometimes I forget everyone here is a brony :p
Thanks kirz, you're very helpful.
Caramel: For you, I might reconsider. (;
6_9
well mostly everyone there may be a few exeptions
Colt_magnum: I own all of the LotR's on BR and they are the EC's
The reviews for it will just ruin it for you though, dont see any reviews until u see it.
Still, I didn't get manualled because no one was paying attention.
Colt_magnum: I saw ParaNorman today, good movie
That or the mods were amused by your shenanigans.
Dari: Oh? I'm such a man that you look like a woman in comparison? Yeah, I can believe that
And they knew you were just making a point.
......
Shizuka: i said hi to the mods and explaned to otakon that i was banned a while ago how is that spamming?
Caramel: dude we haven't even seen a pic of you have we?
Well I'm not a furry, but if you want to know about a couple of things that I like I could tell you?
Either way. That's the short story of colour shenanigans.
otakon: and you never will
LoGaN: it's a autokick, she's away
I almost burned my hushpuppies :P still good thought - especially when dipped in steak sauce :) some rice on the side and green beans would be ideal with this, but too lazy to go to the store
oh
Caramel: well phooey
LoGaN: you mass pinged the ops for no reason
Who in here is a furry?
....
pwny: me x3
And what a tasty story it was.
Spectrum_Rush: i said hi
pwny: that is a question better left pm'd
I got really confused for a minute there, I thought that desktop pony was on my computer :P
did tom finally beat that boss?
Spectrum_Rush: :D mass pinged
..
whoop wrong window
otakon: why?
http://cheezburger.com/6440696064
ooooo
shiny
it gets by because it's not being used often or abused, and most of the people on the channel don't know how to do colors in the first place
its sparkly
well
overkill
Well in terms of games I like the original Spyros on PS1, the PoP trilogy, RDR. I love parkour/freerunning.
GNIGHT everypony
MOKUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
I USED to like Doctor Who.
fluttershyFTW: no such thing
>_>
Exacta.
<_<
:P
night Bronysith sleep well
LoGaN: yes but there might be a kick script on that, maybe
test
Back :P
Goodnight Bronysith :3
Spectrum_Rush: there is no kickscript on emote spamming, just spamming 6 messages in 10 seconds
hiya Alister
its a plane
played tf2, i suck ass at it but its fun
superretroworld: same here
and my stream is DEAD
there it goes
otakon: I know that but i've noticed that sometimes whenever someone mass pings the ops they'll get kicked
otakon: Someone must have shot a couple of your carrier pigeons
DO HO HO
spectrum_rush: it's been a problem in the past
I swear to the internet gods
I almost CRIED during the Timothy Green movie. BUCK the critics, its a great movie! T_T
I WILL HAVE DECENT NET ONE DAY!
otakon's computer is made of his hopes and dreams.
AND THEN I WILL LAUGH!
IMMA FIRE MAH LAZAH
I WILL LAUGH LONG AND HARD!
Major, why wouldn't I? :P
Heh, long and hard.
inb4 someone massively abuses it in manechat and we lose the ability to sneakily colour every now and then
Meanwhile: and I KNEW someone was going to do that
..
When otakon does something, it's always long and hard.
^
and full of rage
^^
fyi:
and capslock
-___________-
best anime opening song ever incoming
He rages, long and hard.
GNIGHT everypony, see you tomorrow. if i survive my first day of college
Who stole my name?
..
FUUUUUUUUUCK!
Bronysith: you'll survive
>: [
Trust the Changeling to bring that up.
ITS OVER 9000
lol
13what was that? "i'm a bad pony and need a noodling"?
The name kind of implies.
Well they will if kirz feels the need to explain it in mane.
XD
Reikim: Ahahaha, yes
welp my download speed won't stop fluctuating
goddammit
:O IM PSHYCIC
Woah, Shizu, I don't think anyone needs a noodling in here.
I ctrl+f that sentence Shizu but yours is the only one that comes up. Wrong chat?
Amazing.
Major : iknow what a carrier Pidgeon is, apparently my grand dad used to train them :)
13hm
13could have sworn i heard it
Ugh, My computer bluescreened so i had to restart it
Did your pshycic abilities tell you how to spell psychic?
Now, some might /want/ a noodling, but that's none of our concern.
And they can PM you for it.
pwny: Look up the error code?
argh
Heh, "PM for a noodling".
I HAVE NO CLUE
what is this???
pwny: that is not good, run maintenence
/me snorts with laughter
13silly otakon thinks i'm ever idling
Indeed.
mature mode activate *boop*
...
But then he's been kicked by more spambot-scipts than anyone else ever.
lol
multiple times too
I wouldn't be surprised if by now he believes that God is a kickbot.
Shizuka: it was in bronystate, LoGan was pinging you
Meanwhile: har har
For spamming too many years on earth
What is this???
dari: No I usually shut my computer off
-_________-
Being kicked is otakon's hat.
IMMA FIRING MAH LAZAH
Megaman?
What is this???
MLP_Brovakiin: neat, I would love to meet him :)
it identifies him.
I will meet you in person one day Meanwhile
you damn midget
Is that the anime version of Peter Griffin?
this looks like eurika 7
What is this????!!!???
You can DL a program that digs up and displays the bluescreen dumps for you
And I will grin.
otakon, Meanwhile's just going to kick you. Physically. It's required.
and I will PUNT you across the yard of Buckingham Palace
HA!
Major: unfortunaly you would have to find a ghost whisperer :(
YOU CAN'T HIT THE CHEAPEST BOT IN THE GAME!
What happened to Mips?
Indeed, I'll boot you in the shin for the sake of the kickbots.
MASF123: it was being a dick
ill run maintenence first
oh
so is limeV too
I hope you bring steeltoe boots
MURDURIZE IT
your size 8's won't even crease my jeans
i g2g, ill be back when i fix my computer
8? I'm size 6.
no misssiles
11,01Hi LoGaN
goddam
Und than Meanwhile shall ascend to the level of Kickbot Avatar, and the Kickbot God shall come to Earth to punish otakon for his sins.
/me thinks limeV is running worse than MIPS was
hi
you're smaller than my mom in footwear
Hit: 0%
LETS DO THIS
hell you're SHORTER than her too
Bear in mind we have different shoe sizes.
okay
11,01Mini-feet Meanwhile?
11,01:p
I'm 5'4 Nitt.
Bear in mind, otakon, that you're STILL a dwarf.
HOW did he get Big-O to dodge?
MLP_Brovakiin: aye, I know that feeling, I lost me great grandfather who served in Korea
he's a tiny brit
that eat's tiny sammiches
no damage
the.. fuck?
what was point
?
made of cucumber with no crusts
That did a whole lot of nothing.
Ew, cucumber.
flouttershyftw: it doesn't deal damage, it gives buffs/debuffs
otakon, how tall are you? Exactly?
and he sips tiny cups of tea
5'10
Hey everypony!:)
pew pew missiles
I like the combat though. Dramatic, over the top and good music.
I'm a head taller than Meanwhile
Dj_Cyber-4G : hello
/me picks up otakon, hoists him over and punts him
I also weight 270lbs.
Jesus
hello DerpDash
You really ARE a dwarf.
I weigh 114.
/me watches as Reikim dislocates his back trying to punt him.
Meanwhile: and you're a fairy
or a gnome
Fairies are okay.
havent i seen this from somewhere vefore
Rei, height?
it's Super Robot Wars
Eh, hold one.
6_9
*on
fluttershyFTW - it's been played on here before
Last I checked I was six foot two, brushing three.
goddammit
I would be happier if I was 6 foot or so
YOU'D be happier?
ive seen games like these before
/me laughs and slaps his knee
so why are we comparing sizes now?
Major: Wow, I'l be honest I didn't know there was a war in Korea :P
Because otakon mentioned my height.
Because otakon started making fun of Meanwhile.
:o
wat
lol
WAT
korean war 2
We have established that Meanwhile is short and skinny, otakon is short and stout, and I'm trying and failing to make a phallic innuendo out of this.
MLP_Brovakiin - it's not really a "war" right now; it's more of an angry standoff with guns
-_____-
HORRY SHEEITT!!
lol
for the past... 60-years or so?
:[ call in da rangers
i forget what that code geass cannon is called
And Rei is tall and twitches awkwardly.
/me smacks Reikim with his +1 Axe of Pissed-Offness
Hadron Collider
in response to twilight_sprinkle
The funny part is, Meanwhile is completely correct.
Caramel ah right!
lol
while stream be awesome, my ability to stay awake isnt
^_^
hate shoe sizes, can never find any in my size >.<
G'night everyone
I have odd finger twitches at times
g'night
bye Chrysalis
What size feet are you kirz?
night Chrysalis
kirz|art: okay, how small/large are your feet?
Yeah, but otakon, that's just 'cuz you're insane.
and i apologise for those who watched it how awquard the BUCK stream was
11 1/2 wide
bye Chrysalis
that's it?
HA!
G'night Chrysalis
over kill
I take a 13 wide
playing mann vs machine with SRw as background...roboception
I might as well be a hobbit
lol
...New canon, otakon is a hobbit.
there was a BUCK stream? crap, i missed it
goddammit
^
WHY DID I SAYT HAT!?
Hobbit internet.
dat Orange-kun
GODDAMMIT!
He lives in a hole, that's why his connection sucks.
Hahahaha
welp that's it
It is literally a potato, with roots that are cables.
/me is laughing his ass off atm.
You brought this on yourself, so you ought to be.
/me yawns
You say you have trouble finding shoes. I wear size 6's. Half the shoes in my size have Spiderman on.
/me pokes otahobbit
and he shall be known as...
well if you can't laugh at yourself then you might have trouble in life
Meanwhile: lol
Otahobbit
no on
What is this?
I like the ring of Hobbitkon.
Hobbton
GUNDAM??
dat pink bot
Sounds like a gathering in the Shire.
this is too cliche
Hobbitkon
CrazyHippie1234: code geass
goddamit
aww
Shirekon? No, that sounds like a convention.
I like Gundam too
that just sounds like a bad convention, Hobbitkon
fluttershyFTW: giant pink mechas are cliche?O.o
dude... you just got owned by a girl in a pink bot
I'd go to Hobbitkon purely to say I've seen otakons house.
A convention of hobbits, where they all debate the best way to eat second breakfast.
wait what its pink :O
It looks like a mashup of a dozen different giant robot series.
indeed
my screen is just black here
it was fabulously pink
0_o
mass anonymous exodus?
refreshing
------Otakon is now the Hobbit of Bronystate---- Discuss :3
Speculate on the better points of elvish rope.
/me doesnt know anything about LOTR lore
and how much Lembas bread is too much
did i miss the pink one kicking *squee*
did i just see speed racer again
fluttershyFTW: ye, but itll be used again eventually
Hi, everypony!
hoi Pinkies4thWall
hulu
Special guest: otakon, the only-known real-life hobbit.
I'm having nothing to do with a LOTR convention, that's just a bit too much :P
hi Pinkies4thWall
Hello Pinkies4thWall :)
hi
hi Pinkies4thWall
hi
a bit of lotr lores
Why does the "Aye captain" guy sound immensely camp.
hey Pinkies4thWall
:O
/me archives this convo
thats one hell of bot
pew pew pew
lazahs
Definitely one of the more amusing ones.
i dont like robot designs with those floating minilazer things. why even have a mecha, why not just use the minilasers
-_____-
actually funny story
I saw a hobbit at Otacon one year
i preffer the fighters rather than mechas
very good costume, even was smoking a pipe.
They're remote controlled weapons by the newtype pilot piloting the mobile suit
bye y'all be back later
now for the attack that always causes an over-reaction from chat
And now I will forever have evidence that otakon is a hobbit.
thats the reason why
otakon's been hitting the pipeweed.
Kandarihu: obviously, im saying why even make a mecha if the minilasers are so powerful
Boob missiles?
ok a fighter that turns into a mecha
is it boob missiles?
hi
well I saw boobs
:O boob missiles
oh this game again
I think she shot her hair.
yes boob missiles
Aphrodite A has them
from Mazinger
Suddenly occured to me, LotR marked the end of the Trilogy event right?
:D AHAHAHA
So much overkill
also, that robot maid from that one series
"boob" pings otakon
yes it did
Someday, otakon, I swear I'm going to pull out this convo in manechat and make it official that you are a hobbit.
no it doesn't
fine go ahead
otakon is a hobbit for best Bronystate meme 2013.
I might be gone for the next week soe it doesn't matter really
Internet says it does so it must be true
ok i recovered from falling down from my chair
You say that now but when you get back and everyone says "Hi Hobbitkon" you know what you'll say?
Speaking of our favourite rage-machine...otakon is now a hobbit. This is now canon. No exceptions.
ARGHAHGAHGEHGHAG?
IM AN ENT
Close but no.
I second this canon change
lol
9 letters, one word.
Goddammit

It is now official. otakon is a hobbit
Caramel its coo.
:O ITS ON THE PSP
otakon is no longer a dwarf. He is now a hobbit.

Oh lookie here, it's official now.
Reikim: a hobbit that is french and on fire...for some reason
fluttershyFTW: no hes using an emulator i think
otakon saved Middle Earth.

otakon: No, you lost the rights to fire when you picked up the big hairy feet and the (literal) potato computer.
Oh god.
otakon I am disapoint. don't save it again.
twilight_sprinkle: noep, it's a PSP and some cables
Back in...ten minutes? Twenty?
otakon: i saw a browser pop up
See ya

Caramel: oh, cool

fluttershyFTW: japan only
Barbetos: It's displaying to a window on his computer, which is also running Desktop Ponies.

Overly complicated attack is GO
The overkill

DerpyMuffins: NO.SUCH.THING.
The only good kill IS overkill
Is there any other kill?
I remember getting the overkill notice in Final Fantasy 10. It always made me happy.

DerpyMuffins - "Nuke it from high orbit"
that's about it
BIG O!
SHOWTIME!
/me shoots derpymuffins in the face
Barbetos: same here

/me points to the hole in you face
HOW do Votom's compete with Super Robots and dimension ripping genetic monstrosities?
uh arent you supposed to be dead
they're only like 20 feet tall
otakon: they're evasive as fuck
like seriously, if someone ever manages to hit that damn thing
I will be impressed
penis grappler
Is this game video or is it being played by the stream host?
Caramel: They would have to be, Votoms aren't well armored kind of like Zaku's
pwny: played
:D lol
pwny: it's a video game being streamed by Caramel
it's got 6k health and little damage output, you tell me :P
He can read japanese?
MOKUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
pwny: not really, but he knows what skills are what through identifying characters

Caramel, I honestly wish you were using colors like the rest of the mods.
why is that picture green?
How should I know. It's your picture.

lol
I just remember the room I was in NOT being green
...
..................
green camera?
and yet I look like the goddamn jolly green jackass
The background of your picture is green.
hey its ryu
Saved for posterity.
kandarihu: I honestly wish you'd stop saying stuff like that. My machine that uses mirc is dead and I'm forced to use our website's embedded client. But thanks for reminding me of the multiple hundreds of dolors I need to spend just to recover the hard drive I need for school in a week
also, shouldn't he be the one on the far left?
Saved forever.
aww its not streamin
wait waht is?
O.O wi=ith a battle axe
Caramel, it's just a suggestion.
otakon doesn't have good enough to be Samwise.
okay chat, this is important:
Caramel: dude that sucks man
good enough connection*
I'm listening
I so know that feel, Caramel.
so he's Frodo because he's always fading in and out? :3
/me stares at Caramel expectantly
Exacta
...
goddammit
/me laughs
need to play some MvM right now, would you guys mind if I streamed it? In addition:
/me chortles and snickers
Dont bite the hand that feeds you
if the server isn't full, could I get some volunteers to play with us?
I've half a mind to throw this in manechat just for laughs.
I am SO glad you three are having a good time at my expense
i'll play with you
fine go ahead
/me glomps otakon
i could host it too if you wanted - bronystate was laggy earlier for some reason
Glomp pile on otakon!

Caramel: I'll join up, it's not like I'm doing anything else.
no no no!

Caramel: I would but my connection is being shitty atm
otakon the hobbit is now perpetually engraved in canon.
but you'll be back once your connection comes back up ^_^
to those who volunteered: PM me your name
otakon is best hobbit.
We won't know when you're gone because we'll just think your internet's playing up.
and I'll need 2 more
otakon: that you?
S'only 3AM...Yeah alright Caramel.
Also, good choice of superimposition, Meanwhile, since that means he ships with Sam now.
/me gettin his flank handed to him in MM10

I explained that, you ponce.
My custom dispenser HUD was causing Steam to freak out.

Oh wait, No Hello NocturnalBlade
lol MLP_Brovakiin hello to you as well
11,01Phase4: Are both your MvM servers up?
11,01Or just one?
what's up with the seal?
11,01Just a placeholder.
reasons
00,02Nittany_Discord, all three should be up
11,01Three?
00,02nyx applebloom and spitfire .ariscop.net
^
so uhh anything going to be streaming? you know, something that isnt a seal?
/me bows "Hello PillowPoni "
00,02Nittany_Discord, spitfire will be turned off at some point but its up untill the MvM hype dies down
11,01You should put MLP Heroes on one of those instead of MvM. Anyway, I can't get on the empty one.
11,01Phase4: K.
Yay to MLP heroes! :D
YA-HA
00,02Nittany_Discord, i wish, mlp heroes seems to be closed
00,02i plan to ask the ponyfortress guys at some point
00,02dislike their map rotations
11,01Well, the PF2 servers are down.
11,01I'd still love to play MLP Heroes even with MvM going on.
11,01I need to build up XP so I can play as a pony one time.
Nittany_Discord: Wait the PF2 servers are down!?! :O
SO......................EPIC!!!!!
00,02Nittany_Discord, password is ponies, not sure how busy my servers are right nowe
00,02i've got 1.2k exp
11,01Ponies47: I think so. They're not appearing on my favorites list.
who's streaming? :3
00,02rarity-spy is op
Derpy_Hooves a seal is
11,01Phase4: Agreed.
Nittany_Discord: Strange. I played on one last night and it seemed fine :/
00,02Nittany_Discord, also you should be able to play as a pony right off the bat, just need to opt-in
waiiit Nittany_Discord all sprays so you can't see others ?
time to start school tomorrow
11,01opt-in?
seriously who's streaming? :3
Whats up with the youtube video?
I have never played as a pony on a PF2 server but I have played as a pony 3 times on a Friendship is all talk server :P
00,02AJIsAwesome, ?
It was awesome :3
stream's been replaced with a embed of a youtube vid for now
11,01No-one's really streaming. This is a placeholder.
oh cool :4
Phase4: The video playing right now.
:3
11,01It's funny.
lol iv'e never seen a youtube video here before
?
00,02woah lag
Nittany_Discord: permission to link a video? :3
But still no video links correct?
11,01I can see default sprays in the TF2 file browser, but I can't see them in Windows explorer.
Ponies47: Yeah, I think.
11,01Derpy_Hooves: Sure.
no i mean you can see other people sprays ?
Ponies47: NVM.
00,02dat youtube embed
11,01Phase4: What do you mean opt in to be a pony? How do I do that?
00,02Nittany_Discord, !pf2
preferably i'd like this as a placeholder http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VazV36eWHLc :3
11,01I can see other people's sprays.
11,01Sometimes, they appear as those magenta and black checkered patterns.
this seal is cute :3
11,01Oh.
00,02Nittany_Discord, type that in the chat and then chose opt-in
XylemTube: More like epic!
11,01Ok.
nah those are normal when the people join and leave
Seal has been going on for about 2 mintues lol
00,02you also chose what pony you want from there
So yes video links?
00,02default its the team princess
yes
Right now?
Nittany_Discord: as you rank up you can choose difrent heros to play through
sure
Ponies47: Yes.
woot woot
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oBq-OU9Ibk&feature=g-all-lik Awwww yeah! I got top comment on this video! :D
11,01Still doesn't explain why I can't use sprays and why Windows explorer and TF2 show two different sets of content for the same folder.
11,01The only thing I can think of is that the sprays are hidden files.
Plus tis a good song as well :3
"Britney has accepted Berry Punch's "Our Eternal Reward""?
BerryPunch... is that you?
11,01Honestly, if we're just looping this on stream, video links should be OK.
Wait
The stream's a loop?
actually tf2 browser let's you see all tf2 stuff even the thing you should not mess with
11,01Phase4: Cool.
Reikim|TF2: Jah
I thought TF2 was being streamed.
normal browser does not show them
Reikim|TF2: It was
Ponies47: expect a message :D
MLP_Brovakiin: Sweet :3

Petrified_Discord: Will do...maybe
Nittany_Discord: speaking of EA http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8wsd1GQve1qey10fo3_1280.jpg
Nittany_Discord: may I suggest an other placeholder :3
Well, I guess doing the Excursion Funnel course tonight is out of the question.

Ponies47: Ok. I'm not one to post videos, but I comment a lot.:$
11,01There's a rumor that the EA leaders want to fire John R, but he'll be replaced be Peter Moore, so it's not like anything will change.

superretroworld: They say the new LOTR is better, because there is more character development, and it follows the book to a T, HE praised the animation of the old LOTR movie, it was ahead of it's time
I tried playing this. It was hard.
/me Is confused by sonicandmario85 now
Dat lag
BRB.
sonicandmario85: Ok :P
Moo
I'm back.
Dark92Enigma: yeah good point
JRP: Wait let me guess! Was that a duck?
its absurd this one guy I was playing with last night upgraded his Beggers Bazooka so it could load 9 rockets at like the speed of light
superretroworld: btw, though i never saw the Old LOTR, i kinda regret not seeing it, because of the animation, and take on the story. But The New LOTR is better.
PaladinDrakkenwolf: Sheesh.:O
he looks like a badass
You have seen Lotr Old vs Lotr New video, right?
PaladinDrakkenwolf: You can upgrade up that far?
flutter_spin: Yeah.
DAT LAG
totally :P
I hate it
AJIsAwesome: well the guy last night did it
flutter_spin: You bet i did!
First time I found out there WAS another lotr movie
PaladinDrakkenwolf: WHAT IT WAS STREAMED YESTERDAY?
i really want that as my wallpaper
heh, didn't know that
Dark92Enigma: It wasn't.
Dark92Enigma: well its always good to give a chance, but peter jackson may had some luck getting a few ideas from the animated ones
SHIBARU
Hi.
I tried playing this as a new guy with no special items. It didn't like me.
Every time I came here, noone else was :(
sorry :P
Lol
flutter_spin: IKR? How they could've fuck that up!.... Why Bashki's wasn't the director again? It was too dumb to be an LOTR movie
What trilogy do you think we should watch next for next year's summer?
have u ever seen prince dari here?
I have married Mike on the sims and we have a beautiful baby boy c:
Nope
LOL
So much funny shit has happened on there lol
AJIsAwesome: indiana jones maybe
i dont buy items i find them on TF2 i ave lots including the sandvich XD
have*
superretroworld: True.
taaaaaaaannnnkkkk!!!
Joining in a round and losing each wave was very discouraging
KILL IT WITH FIRE
superretroworld: And some of them were improved by him. But the battle in the animated one was a classic (according to what i saw in NC's review)
i remember one time somebody died and this one girl couldnt stop whining haha i wanted to kill her
hey shibaru
...what the
one time in TF2 before mann vs machine i ate a sandvich infront of a guy and he was like:Wtf?
seriously you did that?
XD
what?
he was also new LOL
Dat Ed :P
Like I was on a date with Mike and I thought that the food was taking a really long time to get to the table so I looked over at the kitchen and the chef was trying to walk through the counter but it was in his way for some reason and he kept doing that until I left and I could see flies around the plate XD
"have a bonus"
Well, I don't like pvp. It's the only reason why I tried MvM
But it is so hard.
XD
AJIsAwesome: or to make things worse, g1 through g3 of mlp
sims ai
I know that
flutter_spin:even in mvm the bots troll you
AJIsAwesome: Besides STAR WARS, INDIANA JONES, TOY STORY, and NAKED GUN and ALL OF THE REST?.....all of them
I just realized, Austin powers has three movies
AJIsAwesome: I would like to see Neverending Story again, though
I don't care if a bot trolls me. As long as it isn't versus other players.
why?
And then the butler kept picking up the garbage, walking two steps, dropping the garbage, picking the garbage up, walking two steps back, dropping it... XD
Dken2021: OMG! Make that for next year
its the same as it exept with bots
Dark92Enigma: It was good until 3.
people who beat me tend to rub it in
lol
bots can't do that.
also 34 mins until square unveils a world ends with you sequel or something
Mike grabbed a plate of food, walked in the direction of the table, put the plate down, and grabbed another plate
haha
a whipping crowbar, only in TF2
Dark92Enigma: when did you guys watch the neverending story?
Dken2021: eeyup :P
awhile back
SuperBrony64: hjfjhjdjdjdhdjhdjjddh stands for apple
Oh and every time Mike is in downtown, someone always seems to get stuck somewhere XD
pony up?
pony up
PONY UP?
AJIsAwesome: N.S. 1 = Classic. N.S. 2 = Not as good as the original, but it has it's moments N.S.= EPIC FAIL
yup
yea, you heard him
There ain't nothing quite like a bowl of cereal and a pint of milkshake at half five in the morning :D

sonicandmario85: Spongebob reference.
OK, brb bathroom break
MvM was fun, I admit. I just hated losing.
Yea, a long time ago
You definitely need 6 people who know what they are doing.
Sorry i dont speak applesnese i speak Japanese
And you definitely need a variety of classes
that was pretty fun
sonicandmario85 wah wah waaah
Dken2021:ALRIGHT WHO IS THE ONE CRYING?1

/me Ties ShadowQuill to a chair "CALM THE BUCK DOWN!" :[
Well, there didn't seem to be a goal for me in MvM. Losing every round just made it all feel kind of futile.
Ponies47: THE BUCKING DOWNLOAD
ShadowQuill: Dat sucks :<
IT TAKES TOO LONG!
:<
when i get my new laptop and play TF2 on it im probaly gonna find one of those rainbow trumpets that are actually flame throwers by killing someone and then dying as usal XD

ShadowQuill: I don't think I added you on Steam :$
sonicandmario85: Me to :3
Ponies47: That means it went all the way from one hour twenty nine minutes to one hour twenty SEVEN minutes IN 20 MINUTES?! What form of discord is this?!
Ponies47:i found it i didnt buy it i have no bought items i just collected some by killing other people and then dying XD
I feel like crazy Twilight...
ShadowQuill: That sucks. What's your Steam name so I can add you?
Ponies47: Shadow Surge. It's a mix of my OC (this screen name) and my hero, Surge.
moopy says hi to everypony...
WE DONT CARE

LoGaN: Hi, Moopy!
allo moopy, whoever you are
sonicandmario85: I care.......
Moopy is fun to say.
sonicandmario85: I traded the guy who sang the Film Flam brothers song drunk (Look it up on Youtbe if you don't know) I also traded him for 3 other things. Get this I traded him 2 name tags and 2 buckets of paint for this stuff! XD
i was talking about the updated network thing XD
I glanced over a guide on how to win MvM. I read "You must have X" where X is an unlockable tool
Ponies47: LOL AWESOME
Ponies47: Have you heard him sing "Winter Wrap Up"
just wondering, can your internet connection make the stream bad quality? Or is it for everyone.
Simply put, it's stupid for new players
ah nevermind, not funny anymore :P
Ponies47: Just to let you know, his name is Baconhair.
"DOMINATED! But you're a good man and I love ya"
i wonder what would happen if someone hacked TF2 and made everyones weapons overpowerd XD
One hour fourteen minutes. It's speeding up! (I would put crazy Twilight face here! IF WE HAD ONE!)
AJIsAwesome: I know! I found him and friended him on Steam! :D
Wolfmane: Yup, it can. But sometimes it's like it for everyone.
and make rockets explode into nukes
Ponies47: Sweet!

SuperBrony64: moopy says waz up?
Ponies47: I love his drunken stupor so much. I wish I could sing those songs with him.......

All right, we survived Mannworks on Advanced. I am proud.

LoGaN: How did you find him? O.O
Reikim|TF2 we made up the dream team
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We-sCBmi8hY&feature=related
Ponies47: Someone sho's been on here more than once.
AJIsAwesome: Old bronystater who got the ban hammer
Barbetos: /)
he on xbox
Ponies47: What did he do?
Reikim|TF2 we should do it again sometime (\
What did Moopy get the banhammer for?
MirrorImage: /)
moopy? I think I mremeber him
for mooing?
Reikim|TF2: and AJIsAwesome he keept picking fights with the mods. Most of the time being Wrek :|
theres a handmade discord plush on ebay for $70
whaaaaaa...
One does not simply moop into Mordor.
how is that even possible?
/me is feasting on cottage cheese and potato chips, *yum* :P
also people can probaly use other computers to get on here if their banned
Ponies
a computer programmer can do this
Ponies47: I know this is dragging on, but how would he pick fights?
you just have to know how
/me Has Pringles :3
i dont have another computer
Ponies47: who?
oh wow, this seal video is still going on?
sonicandmario85: The mods will just reban them.
Barbetos: One does not simply MOOP in Bronystate.
Buytoast: hit refresh
AJIsAwesome: By being a jerk whining and complaining trash talking Ect :|
Reikim|TF2:what if they have undreds of computers?
ah
i guess
Ponies47: Ok. Thanks for letting me know.
superretroworld: Old bronystater who got banned by the name of xxMoopyxx
sonicandmario85: It's easy to change an IP. You don't even have to change computers. But it's hard to regain the mods' trust. They'll just keep banning you.
I had it running for an hour before I realized
AJIsAwesome indubitably.
sonicandmario85: For more details, ask an actual mod. Like Shizu.
advanced difficulty is so very very painful
But fun.
oh yes
sonicandmario85: Losing a mod's trust is the fastest way to lose a mod.........FOREEEEEEEEEVER!
We got the perfect team combination.
Ponies47: oh, i may remember him
Reikm|TF2:and you can just keep on changing ips untill they decide to give up because youll just keep doing it and doing it
sonicandmario85: Again, I think the mods have their ways around that. Ask them if you must.
superretroworld: He was a jerk. Never really liked him :|
thats probaly what a troll would do XD
Aaaaaa
I remember Moopy...vaguely.
Do what you want cuz a pirate is free. You are a pirate
Reikm|TF2:what if they think your a new user?
sonicandmario85: They're mods. You think they're gonna give up? This is bronystate. He shouldn't have been trash talking here anyways.
Moopy...I don't remember much about him.
13and phlog shizu for the massively OP
Barbetos: lol, that sums up the reddit review post I just read
But yes, a Shizu on any team is OP.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOb6Z5Tja68&feature=related
skip to 8:15
AJIsAwesome:you could probaly just make the mods think your a new user with a new ip and yyouve been banned
DAT FLAME RAINBOW.
but dont tell them you were banned
sonicandmario85: Let's stop talking about this.
OKEY DOKEY LOKEY
sonicandmario85 and we call that ban evasion
Shizuka: How's it going over on Nyx?
What about Nyx now?

Nittany_Discord: might actually have some use for my strange natasha then lol
I'm new. What use would I be in MvM?
I get the same thing...8:00 shift? stay up to three!
flutter_spin - if you can keep a sentry alive, you could pass as engineer
Reikim|TF2 - the nice thing for me is that i work second shift
Lots of youtube
so i don't work until 1pm
but still
flutter_spin: You would be taking heavy with rage, fire speed, and penetration.

Need server info and all that
Reikim|TF2: what do you mean by experienced?
NocturnalBlade: Good with airblast, not dying, etc.
NocturnalBlade - can you properly identify priority targets?

who is the bad spy not using a Big Earner?
looks like Nit
Nittany_Discord
don't use a regular knife
11,01What should I use?
use the big earner - gets you cloak AND health once you apply that upgrade
ShadowQuill: Paste what?
ideally, you'd use a dead ringer as well
AJIsAwesome: I just pasted what I had copied lol
ShadowQuill: Ok.
11,01I don't have a dead ringer.
Nittany_Discord: ?
the TF2 keyboard XD
eh, good enough thern
AJIsAwesome: I'm gonna try again. Hold on.
Nittany_Discord: Cloak n Dagger and Big Earner.
Tb. Tb. :$$b. $$$b. :$$$$b. :$$$$b. :$$$$$$b :$$$$$$b $$$$$$$b $$$$$$$b $$$$$$$$b :$$$$$$$b :$$$$$$$
so long as pyros don't get you, you have a great escape route
O_O
stab stab stab to recharge your cloak, then cloak to run like a little screaming girl
13....
WTF WAS THAT
11,01I don't have Cloak and Dagger
DAMMIT SLENDER
whenever i think pyro, i think gyro
dang it Nittany_Discord... one sec
11,01ShadowQuill: Please don't spam.
ShadowQuill: Be careful. You could get kicked for spam. I know you didn't mean it.
Nittany_Discord: I just pasted what I had copied...
13why
11,01It's spam.
13under what circumstances would you think that's a good idea?
gimme a bit Reikim|TF2 and i'll be on
Nittany_Discord:he accidently did it
idk...
Sorry.
11,01Oh.
13nitt can have my big earner, but dun have extra watches
Must... wait... longer...
11,01I have a Big Earner.
i have an extra cloak and dagger if you'd like that Nittany_Discord
44 mins
11,01Just no extra watches.
Whatever you do though, Nitt, don't take the Eternal Reward.
though dead ringer is much more effective if you can get it
11,01MirrorImage: Sure.
Cloak and sap like hell. Max sapper first.
Reikim|TF2 - i actually do one point of Health/Kill on the first wave
then waves 2 and 3, i dump into sapper
11,01I might not stick with Spy. I find I die too often.
I dunno, I've never played spy.
ShadowQuill: Hey, me! How am I doing?
I played a game with Meanwhile once, though, and he destroyed with maxed sapper.
11,01I don't like Scout and Spy because they're so fragile.
ShadowQuill: I'm not doing too good, me. I'm going crazy
the first wave, you can get away with no sapper
so Reikim|TF2 whats the server info...cause when i start tf2 i gotta leave here
second wave is ehh...
third wave is stupid easy once you get the sapper upgraded
for some reason when i extent my left leg my knee cap cracks but its no big deal i dont feel it crack
extend*
/me gives ShadowQuill a persim berry
For some reason when I hear this I think Winter Wrap Up
AJIsAwesome: What are those
sonicandmario85: You mean it pops?
Dun dun dun dun dun
ShadowQuill: Pokemon reference. THey heal confusion.
AJIsAwesome:yes
AJIsAwesome: lol
ShadowQuill: i dont see any similarity at all
Gotta sleep. Bai everypony!
superretroworld: Then I am crazy.
nite lowfn
night lowfn
lowfn: Night!
Nighty night lowfn :)
Just a little bit of it
my legs pop alot so do my arms sometimes
11,01How do you play Spy? You can't backstab until your cloak is gone.
when i extend them
sonicandmario85: You are telling us this why? Same happens with my knees
disguse
Nittany_Discord - you can uncloak at any point
sappper is more useful for MvM
you don't have to wait for your cloak to expire
ShadowQuill:im not asking why it must because im putting it in a awkward positsion also
11,01But it takes a while for cloak to deactivate.
29 minutes
Phlog is possibly the Best MvM weapon
39 I mean
what is this dubstep or techno?
as long as you're diguised and not on fire, the bots don't pay attention to you
all you have to do is break line of sight and you can rush back in to backstab
and if they don't "see" you backstab someone else, they don't turn around to see you undiguised
This music is hurting me.
SPEAK
/me Ooh, italics!
/me is easily amused
ShadowQuill: how do you switch to italic?
superretroworld: Use /me
/me is showing superretroworld how it works
/me derp derp derp
superretroworld: You don't. That's a command option. You type "/me"
ShadowQuill: like this?
ShadowQuill: You can get kicked for spamming italics.
/me HELLO
/me No, like this you silly noodle
AJIsAwesome: OH because role play?
ShadowQuill: Yes.
did the grey man get you guys?
AJIsAwesome: I see...
heading to bed
night peoples :P
/me testing
alright cya
Everyone hug sb64
someone go give Nittany_Discord a Dead Ringer
got it
superretroworld: It works. But stop for now. You can get kicked for that.
AJIsAwesome: okay
wonder if there will ever be a green team on TF2
never
then it will be red vs green vs blue
it would be nice to have 3 teams XD
sonicandmario85: They could team up after one team.
sonicandmario85: That would kill the point of 3 teams.
Wrek I have a challenge for you
AJIsAwesome:what if some noob on blu kills green XD
sonicandmario85: That would be cool O.O
AJIsAwesome: is role play banned on here or something?
i mean on roblox in a war game on it there was 3 teams they didnt team up on 1 team
superretroworld: It isn't, but if you spam it too much you'll get kicked.
Question: What's TF2 Boot Camp?
oh
Boot Camp is pretty much normal mode mvm if i'm not mistaken
They made it sound like a completely different game :P
BANANA POWER
Did you guys want me to join in?
oh, nevermind
mann mode is an entirely new game
well
severely more difficult
is the mode with just the blu and red team still on there?
but I need sleep. Alright, later. I need to throw some things away tomorrow with my mom away anyways
yYeah
inkBot: are you made of ink and are you a bot?
JRP:LOL

Boltasar: Hi!

Sabershy:saberspark related name much?
Yep, though honestly, I don't know who is Saberspark. From what poeple tell me, he is an important brony documentarist?
sonicandmario85: What's wrong with that?
Sabershy: Mostly yes.
Sabershy:hes on youtube
Oh.
WHAT SICK MAN SEND BABIES TO FIGHT
Sabershy: Check him out on Youtube. He does livestreams and episode reviews as well sometimes.
My name consists of two references: Saber belongs to Saber from Fate/zero and Fate/stay night and shy belongs to the last name of Fluttershy.
Sabershy:he also does some brony music
if only he knew about bronystate..
im sure lots of bronys will visit this site when they find it XD
sonicandmario85: i wonder if there are any celeb bronys in digusie
Nittany_Discord: Is your YouTube by any change NittanyTiger1?

My class is usually Heavy
POOTIS

ShadowQuill:same
demoman is fantastic
alot of times though i use medic XD
sonicandmario85: :|
cool spy play
Ringo: WALRUS Paul: Bloody ringo, lets make a cd
i guess gaben didnt add ponies to TF2 so brony haters dont hate on him for it XD
smart idea
but other people put it in with mods
XD
can you sap robots on there since they are electrical?
yeah
fuck yea
sonicandmario85: yea
it's either disables them temp. or slows them if they're giants
if they make it past wave five with no trouble... they have a small chance of winning
wait
this has been easy so far grooviebones
nvrmind thought it was mann up, nah this is scrub stuff
Good morning Bronystate!
how to win TF2:play as spy and disguise as a robot and then hangout with the robots XD
simple
Jim: morning

Four bleeding hours on TF2

BAN YOURSELF NOW
Shizuka! We are watching...
Sketch_Toku_Brony, Boredom mayber

Thanks Shizuka for the music :3
And the stream is gone
Now what will i do
I don't know really?
try this http://funnyjunk.com/text/4024206/Say+you+re+under+21/
How about this? Anyone got a problem I can try to help? :)
yes
Sabershy I have one.
That didn't help me
Sure. How can I help you, thegt90 and Kuma?
i cannot find a dual monitor mlp screen saver
all i keep getting is wallpapers
Sabershy hm... well... I need pony but I cant wait till season 3 comes, build me a time machine? :P
thegt90: Have you tried having two screen savers for each monitor?
nope, that page you posted didnt even load
Sooooo
i dont think there is a free program that does that
Kuma: Try reading fanfiction. It helps a bit in keeping "it" at bay. Just remember that none of the stories are canon. Some where so good, I ended up believing they were canon till I remembered they are fiction.
Computer derp
Sabershy I was kidding though, I just need inspiration for art, nothing more ^^
i'm bored and lonely still, oh well, such is life
man i wish i had insperation to draw again but i have bad case of ADHD every time
thegt90: Well you got me then. I don't have much software/hardware experience in computers.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnPzEOSoK7Q&feature=related <- Dat Ed :P
yeah same here all i know is hardware
Kuma: Oh... Um? Try drawing something from a past experience? Maybe drawing a pony going through something that you have once?
Ponies47: Wow, that is kinda... addicting.
Sabershy: How so? O.O
all i can draw is cars
/me Can't draw at all :P

The_Doctor: :'(

AdamTheDuck: Why. You just wrentched my heart pretty good. :(
I HATE MANN UP MODE SO MUCH
It's sooooooooooo haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaard'
Eulshy: That's what she said
Sabershy: Don't worry, even I cried the second time :;(
I spent just 5 hours on one and quir after the 16 wave 8 of 8
:'( *
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Personally, I would say xBox 360, but only for the fact that Halo 4 and Call of Duty has zombies.
Sabershy sorry for the late response ^^ hehe thats a good idea :D
Really AdamTheDuck, I mean really?
Eulshy its not hard ^^ you just need to right people with you~
Jmo4267: Yeah... After My Little Dashie... I've become a big softy :3
Not that, I mean response to Eulshy.
the^
idk Sabershy i had a 360 but not even 5 months passed and it got RROD and support didnt give a flying feather so 360 i dont really trust anymore,some of the game I like but sigh idk :$
You couldn't resist >__>
Jmo4267: But it was so tempting :D
Kuma, we tried so many times...
I got 3 tickets and a voucher and haven't made it through once
Kuma: Oh thats good. I can't draw, sing, or write, but for some reason I can give ideas and build on what people have. A sorta freak ability.
I feel like I've talked with you before, sabershy
I was under the nick "Doctor_Whooves
m, The_Doctor long time no typed too

Storm chaser
Still gotta learn the background pony names.
ah, deflector heavies
one of the biggest assholes of the mode
All spies on the scout :P
?
Excellent, I've got a new phone.
Jim: Sweet. I need a new phone and a new computer. But mostley a new computer
I need someting to do
Decided it was time to upgrade from my old junkphone to a smartphone, because I will probably need something to browse the net on when I go into the army
Jim: Lucky you got a Smartphone. I want a Smartphone. Forget Iphone's :P
Nokia N9, it's quite decent
My dad use to have this really awesome Smartphone I forget the model was but it was awesome until he left it on his trunk and drove off with out it inside the car. Now he's got a crappy Smartphone that he hopes to get rid of before the end of the year.
we sure are taking our time with preparations
I need someting to do, im boooooorrrreeed
Bang your head in a wall
That always helps for me
Time flies when you bang your head into a wall
Mostly because you knock yourself unconcious and wake up hours later
Jim: XD
Jim, i've tried that, and have given myself concussions and im not allowed to do it anymore
time is for the weak
00,02Sumica, back
You'll never be bored if you have a TARDIS
00,10yeah it kick you due to inactivity
Tardis? Where?
Somewhere wibbly wobbly
Stream over :(
Timey Wimey?
Well until you flip your table
/me Flips 2 tables
/me snaps his fingers; the doors to the tardis open
Alright, I believe I can fit almost everyone into the Police Box, just don't press any buttons until I can get the right coordinates set on this thing
Barcelona, yes, we should all go to Barcelona; the Planet, not the country, very different the two, well, the food's quite the same
AdamTheDuck, beat it already, just do criss cross
Eulshy: :S
?
/me Yawns
Jah
Bed time.
Goood ngiht everypony :)

The_Doctor: and back in time by a few days at least? Still gotta work tomorrow.
Good night Ponies47
Goodnight Ponies47. Sweet dreams. :)
night Ponies47
Sabershy: Heh, Homework. Indeed
/me Hugs AdamTheDuck Sabershy and Jim :)
:$
Alos Sabershy I never ahve dreams when I sleep anymore ;~;
*Also
*have
/me Goes to bed
A trick for me is to get really warm. Maybe because of more bloodflow, but I sorta have more dreams that way. Plus, geting an constant 7 to 9 hours of sleep everyday helps.
Sleep is for the weak :P
Yes, why would we sleep if not for us being weak from not sleeping?
http://goo.gl/CLCGc
Not sure if the image will load though
it loaded
Jim: So I heard you like riddles... :P
I want to print an a2 poster of that
and pin it up on my wall so I can stay awake to finish the never ending maths homework
Sabershy, So you put a riddle inside a riddle?
Well, some of us would love being asleep, but are pretty much natural night owls.
what is this sleep thou art speakest of
Jim: Didn't feel like finishing it, but I thought you would have gotten the idea. :)
So just sleep during the day, no biggie
Yay we sparked a conversation!
annnnnnnnnnnd then chat died
But it is kinda awkward to wake up at 5:30 pm
Like I did yesterday
that's almost a bit late.. kinda
I hate waking up at night, seeing the sunset and thinking "damn, is it the morning?"
Oh! You should experience that in Northern Norway during July!
Because the sun never sets then, so you would have NO idea what time of day it is when you wake up
since it's light out constantly
That is different. I honestly can't sleep until I snuff any and all lights in my room.
That and for some reason, my body wants a nap at 1 pm everyday, Sunday.
*every Sunday.
Dropdown curtains is a must
I could not survive without them
Ahahaha, omfg http://i.imgur.com/pd6FK.png Worth the read
00,10got room for a 6th in MvM
I'm in
Phase4: ?
Or Jim
I wish I can play TF2. It looks interesting.
You haven't played TF2 before?
lol Jim maybe that guy was messin w/ Iron Will :D
So quiet...
indeed
Nope. I never play any of that. Quite bluntly, I never heard of it reallt ill I came to Bronystate and saw a stream of people playing it.
Hmm
My heart felt like it stopped for a sec
Well, it's free to play, so you should check it out when you got time:)
JRP, oh?
Cool. Well, everypony. I think it is time for me to sleep.
Night Sabershy
6_9 just microwaved a slice pizza and a piece of pepperoni was gonna fall off so i pushed it back on to the pizza and it sounded like the pizza squeed for a sec lol
bye Sabershy
cya Sabershy

Goodnight to you too sketc- oh well...
g'mornin' Bronystate
morning
Wow, dead chat AND no stream? Odd.
yeah
I guess alot of people have started school/working now
I guess so.
Or the zombieponies got to them first:o
Though if I remember right, it's nighttime right now in Europe.
not really
I could be wrong. =P
11am in central europe now
Yay talking for once
:P
AdamTheDuck: wohoo
I live in Florida, so I really have no idea what time it is in other places. XD
Other than other time zones in the US
Maybe I'm thinking of Austrailia. It's nighttime there, right?
I know that the US is behind europe, so it's probably early morning there now?
It's 5am over here
Gold_Demona: Lol no, it's 1907 hours
1907=nighttime ;)
or.. maybe not:P
1907 = 7:07
pm
Well considering it's winter, sun does go down earlier than summer
it's still night time.. for some people.. around the world.. somewhere
So I guess it is night :3
lol
you're from australia, AdamTheDuck?
Eeyup
I've wondered that myself
AdamTheDuck: hehe true that
Considering I haven't even been in snow in my life yet :3
AdamTheDuck: Im from Norway, so I can send you some snow in the mail if you want some:P
(but it's nothing here right now tho)
Agrold: Haha :D
mostly because Australian summer gets really hot...
how how then?
can get up to 40 degrees celcius
oh my
:P
Not sure what that is in farenheit
Could easily convert it real quick in google
But yeah, I think there was a heat wave of 3 days in a row of having a temperature of 40+
summers here only get to 30C.. if we're lucky:P
around last year
Let's see. 40 C is about 104 F... Holy CRAP that's hot. O_o
My point exactly...

Well, that was weird. Chat plug-in broke on me
get an IRC client
What's a good one for mac?
00,10could check and see if mirc has a mac version
iunno google it
Dear god
00,02xchat, the one i use, has a mac version
I just saw the most horrible video game commercial ever
00,02theres a fork called hexchat that is actively maintained
Spell-of-Gaming do tell
It was that Gameboy Micro commercial
Oh god.
00,02i think i've figured out whats wrong with modern gaming/music/movies/television
CoDfags. :3
What is it phase?
00,02originally it was 'give me money to perform my craft and you get the rights to sell it', or things were self funded and so on. creative projects were popular and made money
Ohey! I just noticed there are mods in the chat. Hi mods.
They're one of the reasons why some Japanese games aren't being released/localized :3
00,10oh hi
00,02somewhere along the line it got flipped, investors pay to have a game/movie/song/show made, like its any other comodity
00,02that simply doesnt work in a creative industry
Phase4: Well said
I wonder what would happen if we still have punch cards these days
00,02zynga (i think, the guys who make farmvile) are a perfect example of this
^
00,02reducing the entire creative pipeline to a science
JAGUAR JAGUAR JAGUAAAAAAAAAAAAR
00,10you know when ever tf2 has a new patch, I wish they would up the items per week limit
00,02i'm not AGAINST using psychology or any other science to produce art, but just the science can only get you so far
00,02Sumica, that would be nice
00,02would throw the economy out of wack though
yeah 7 drops every 2 weeks aint enough
00,02Spectrum_Rush, its 10 a week iirc
00,1010 a week
00,10ueasly at least 4 of them boxes
00,02http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Item_drop_system
so is it 10 items per person or something
close enough, always half are crates
00,02its a fancy bit of statistics, you CAN get 12 but its unlikely
00,10new version of theme song, I like it
im out guys night
00,02no ones streaming?
00,10feel like playing more MvM?
Night thegt90 :)
bye thegt90
00,02Sumica, why not
00,02i'll reboot
00,10oki
Ok, how do I find this chat in a client?
i just use bots like tom to get to differant chats
Ok what you need to is join the server irc.ponychat.net
*do
then type /join #bronystate
Hey, I got it. =D
Woohoo stream!
00,02hurry up windows
00,02theres robots to kill
Thanks for the help everyone. I've got XChat Azure going now on my mac. =)
00,02^_^
00,10any one want to trade a strange somthing i dont have for a strange market gardner?
HE-HE-HELLO MAH SEXY BLAUWKS
The Big Bang is a lie.
00,02havent figured out how these rocket jump weapons work yet
Phase
00,02oh interesting
00,02ofna01, yeah?
They are easy, Phase4.
if my Dell was working i would teach you lol
00,10what are you doing Phase4?
sticky jumper its easy though
00,02Sumica, looking at how to use the market gardener while tf2 loads
00,10ah
00,02there we go
PLAY MVM
00,10you have to be jumping or some shit no?
00,02yeah
Just hit the person you land on.
00,02Sumica, any server prefference?
Sinple as that.
00,10nah
Phase, i know the secret to finding an MvM server quicl
*simple
quickly*
00,02i still want to try a mann up game
00,02ofna01, use mine :P
Just make your own server.
00,02i've got 3 running, probably all empty right now
since when do you have one
D:
00,02since for a while now
my dell
00,02applebloom.ariscop.net nyx.ariscop.net and spitfire.ariscop.net
my dells video card may have died, and it had a virus
so yeah
00,02spitfire seems to have the fewest problems, it has a bit more ram
00,02password on all those servers is 'ponies', feel free to use them ^_^
how much RAM you got on those?
00,02spitfire is 512MB, others are 256
my computer would explode if i tried to host
00,02litterally doing nothing else so the servers squeeze into 256 nicely
hm
00,02load faster tf2
LOL
00,02Sumica, i'm connecting to spitfire
00,10ok
Phase4 i bet you're all haxor leet and run things from prompt
Phase, you got some graphical glitches it appears.
00,10now if only phase would kill his game sounds and leave on his music =p
BALLOOOOOONICOOOOOOOOOOOOOORN
00,02Mutterguy, theres ways to run things without the prompt?
why is bronystate ded
I have no idea! I'm using words and don't their meanings!
Had to turn the client off. Chat froze on me and I couldn't figure out how to "refresh" it. =/
i actually beat a MvM map on hard on my first try....
well, Advanced, but you know what i mean
00,02we needs players
Phase4 , if you have a huntsman, USE IT
that thing kicks complete and utter ass in MvM
00,02because i suck
Phase4: on me way
huntsman isnt really hard though
and if your not good you can easily switch
phase makes me feel hat and wep poor....
:~:
Phase4: You can't be that bad.
Everyone can at least hit a body shot
00,02i cant headshot
00,02all i can do is throw piss
00,02and i manage to fail at that
headshot isnt important with snoipah
i mean Huntsman
:<
MAGIC
Huntsman + fire rate upgrade + ammo capacity upgrade = lulz
Yes.
SMG+ Fire Rate+ Health on kill + damage per shot = lulz
ofna01: I actually won Mannworks with that weapon
same
Mannworks is fairly simple
I got the pre-order AWP from CS:GO on TF2 :D
00,02XAX, i did see you have fun with that
god damnit XAX
00,02the hunstman i mee
00,02meen'
Phase4: Infinite arrows. Need dem knees.
00,02^
i used to be a robot like you then i took an arrow in the knee
^ pretty much
HAAAAAAAAX

Smack 'em on the head with his wrench and suddenly they do his bidding.

FLVS
Florida Virtual School
damn mate
im sorry for ya
i have anxienty issues, so regular school is often counter-produtive for me
i see
wonder if i can get all of my steam games saved...
man
im going to need my TF2, there's no doubt about that
you live in beutiful world right now
trust me
it will come
when shit will be real
as when you will need to sit on your own ass
my IL2-Sturmovik, i payed 9.99 for it, Teamspeak, my brothers MX Simulator,
you payed?
yeah
how you earned that money
got it during the steam summer sale, IL2 Sturmovik 1946
okey mate
i do chores, mow lawns, etc etc
i get it you bought it
shit
;]]]]]]]]]
CRIT PYROS
oh god
regulars are bad enough
ofna01: Backburner pyro with maxed ammo cap and damage and what else with uber or crit canteens is pure destruction
why is there no share money feature in MvM?
that needs to be implemented
ofna01: Because money IS shared
ofna01: Ummm money is shared in the way everyone earns the shame amount of money. Though some may have a little left after getting a upgrade
In terms of picking up dosh, everyone gets a bit
DOSH
LOAAAAAADSA MONEY
Dosh here grab it while it's hot lads
MUNNAY MUNNAY MUNNAY
/me toshes dosh into fire
now it really IS hot :D
You're all fur coat no nickers bitches!

Uhh what other horrible British accent qotes are from Killing Floor?...
tf2 is srs bsns people
quotes*
srs bsns
ofna01, it sure is
SPAH
wanna know what sucks?
my first MvM game, beat it, DIDNT GET CANTEEN
ofna01: Yeah same, got mine the next day though
BOINK
appeared out of nowhere in my inventory
i like robo-scouts
whats a canteen?
Daily wtf's, I already like the sound of that site
d3rb: You buy powerups like 5 seconds of uber or crits
CRIIIIIIIIIIIITS
ah...clearly the first time i have played mann vs machine
and tf2 in a long time
MvM is ossum
ossum possum
From my experience playing this as Engineer, one of the best possible ugrades is Melee speed. It lets me repair my sentry at high speeds.
i know, im gonna get back into tf2 just for this
KAnda
best possible upgrade combo IMO is mini sentry and sentry firing rate upgrade
Yes?
I wonder how many hours of tf2 Phase has played in the past half week :D
Well, the one time I did MvM, Sentry Firing Rate is one of the earlier upgrades I got.
DAT BOT TAUNTED U
lol
Dude, can you imagine a regular TF2 match in which everymerc has ALL of their MvM upgrades fully upgraded?
every person would be gpd
god
except medic
ofna01, but up against each other, though.
fully upgraded heavy
MEGUSTA
Upgrading pointless shit to annoy Shamroc is fun.
eeeeyup
Sure it's making me not be credit to team at all, but...
Steam LAUNCH HOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
*TF2 LAUNCH HOOOOOOOOOOO!
ENGINEER EES CREDIT TO TEAM
Mutterguy: SERVER FULL HOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
my first game i played engie
and the loadout server was down
still kicked ass
Yes.
Hmm, according to Steam, Phase4 has 54.1 hrs last two weeks / 344.0 hrs on record for TF2
27 hours per week?
Dayum
Damn
It's worknig ^^

It would be best lulz. :(

If anyone wanted to know what fifty shades of grey is like, check out this video by Nostalgia Critic. May have offensive language. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2ekM3IvIvI
fifty shades of grey is glorified twilight fanfic, and not even decent smut
It's disturbing and stupid at the same time how Fifty Shades of Grey came to be.
I don't even know why it should be popular.
alot of stupid things are popular

So it turns out my phon has been deactivated. And I don't have the money for a card
Ouch
why?
Card expired today when I thought it was tomorrow and I loaned my sister some money for gas so now I can't call or text anyone
PillowPoni: oh man that sucks
PillowPoni: That seriously sucks.
And I have to take my niece to get her shots but I don't have her car seat which is taking a HUGE FUCKING RISK
PillowPoni: How old is your niece?
Because the law in my state says that small kids have to sit in a car or booster seat until the age od siz I believe
Six*
Good afternoon bronies :)
Afternoon MaxTheBrony
AJIsAwesome she's four and a tall four year old too
Hello MaxTheBrony :)
I thought they just had to be a particular height to be able to sit without a booster seat
If I get stopped by the police I'm in deep.shit
PillowPoni: Wow. I don't now what to say except I hope your day goes much better than it already is.
Hello MaxTheBrony
MaxTheBrony: Hello!:)

MaxTheBrony: Oi
Gold_Demina it used to be that way but.they changed it. Niw they're thinking about having kids in a car seat until theyre ten years old
hi MaxTheBrony
Heya killerpony7733 and ponies_8989 :D
AJIsAwesome its just those two things thag are pissinf me off.
PillowPoni: Do you have a home phone? You could call your sister and have her take your niece to the doctor.

killerpony7733: Sounds delicious.:)
I only have a cellk phone and my sister is at school atm and she has work 3-11pm tonight so she'll be gone all day

*Hugs*
:d
AJIsAwesome I'm gonna need it. The doctors offife is downtown and police roam downtown. *sigh*
As I was saying, does anyone here have Animal Crossing: City Folk? :3
AJIsAwesome: Hate shrimp so yeah not the type or ramen i woule eat
PillowPoni that really sucks
looking out for the law and stuff
ponies_8989 tell me about it
my dad does that when he drives
No one?
Okay then
:)
Spell-of-Gaming: Sorry, no. Never liked Animal Crossing.
if I had the wii i'll buy animal crossing
Ponies_8989 I HAVE to watch out for them and I HAVE to geg my niece to tbe doctor for theese shots.
Kids in a car seat until the age of 10? That's quite excessive - and very rediculous. 10 years olds are large enough to fit in the seat without
Cypresswork I know right? And my niece is very tall for her age. By age ten kids wont fit into a car seat
Cypresswork only South Carolina =_(\
no doubt that concept was thought up by the same folk who think dodgeball is too violent or no one can ride a bike without 15 pieces of safety equipment
well that sucks
Dodgeball is too violent? ROfl
Good morning, everypony! :)
Mornin' RaveBrony
/me waves to Jmo4267
Morning RaveBrony
I couldn't agree more. I mean these same lawmakers played and roughhoused as kids and theh survived. Hell, we did as kids and we're fine.
RaveBrony: Morning!
Hello RaveBrony
at age 10 I had my own motorcycle and ran it into a thornbush once without a helmet
Morning RaveBrony
Mornin RaveBrony
Who won Cypresswork?
/me waves to Barbetos|AtWork, AJIsAwesome, MLP_Brovakiin, PillowPoni, and ponies_8989 as well :$
Me, I came out with a really cool scar to show for it :)
hi RaveBrony
And now the ladies won't leave you alone.
Hi Cypresswork
OH HAI CCCP!
Hello CCCP how's your day going
Hiya CCCP! :)
good :3
hi Barbetos|AtWork
Cypresswork good :)
Barbetos|AtWork ladies love scars
:D
for all the "good ideas" I had growing up, I'm a walking wreck :D
:)
:3 like the idea to have a jumping contest
Any Harry Potter fans here? You might find this hilarious: http://fuckyeahneville.tumblr.com/post/973414149/reasons-neville-is-a-bamf
...from a tree
Cypresswork all the awesome stories
Neville the bawss
he gets all the b****s
Bitches.
Not that hard.
ikr
Barbetos|AtWork soook following that blog
That is the only funny thing on that blog
All the rest of it is pics of the actor mostly..
And you can tell its for fan girls
true that
mostly
1. The Sorting Hat is no longer used at Hogwarts; students are sorted based on how long it takes them to cry in the presence of Neville Longbottom. < favorite
Barbetos|AtWork: Roflmao, that was great! :D
note to self, put spaces between sentences O_o
ouch!
Well at least it was not 20 feet
wasnt the first time I fell out of a tree, but one of the worst - knocked the wind out of me
Voldemort can't really fly. He only falls after Neville kicks him lololol
Okay. This is te last one I will post. 24. When Neville is in a duel, he doesn’t need to use Expelliarmus; he just walks up and takes his opponent’s wand.
Cypresswork: Wow.:O
Barbetos|AtWork: Thats my fav :D
lol really?
I also really like 11 :D
Good read, haha
:) another good idea - I got into a roman candle fight with the son of a friend of my dad's - kids name was Adam - fight got out of control and I got burned in the chest, got a scar in its place
well, that audiosurf demo didnt last long
Cypresswork: Well damn o_o
It seemed like a good idea at the time :P
Cypresswork: Shit, you had one helluva childhood :D
Cypresswork: Your childhood was awesome.:O
I once samcked a pointy hammer on my skull once >_<
smacked*
Allos all
heya Unnr :)
olla Unnr
/me waves.
Unnr: Hi!
/me wishes steam would fix their proken price policy
Hello Unnr
broken*
ponies_8989: get a nick :D it will become much easier for us to remember you :D
My parents weren't gonna hold my hand - they just let me do whatever, as long as I didnt burn the house down - so you want to stick a penny in the outlet? Try it out! ....yeah, hurt like hell, didn't it :) Don't do that no more
how should i do that?
/me is geeking out, squeenix has a teaser site up hinting at a sequel to TWEWY.
./nick [redacted]
Cypresswork: all the best stories end with 'It seemed like a good idea at the time:
Learned the hard way :D
./nick[redacted]
damn it
LOL
:P
Without the . and [redacted]
yeah
For example; /nick MaxTheBrony
he did that on purpose...
exactly
:p
sometimes I wish I lived in Russia, so my steam games would be 1/3th the price or something the like...
O.O
meh, i think il stay in sweden and wait for the steam sale every year
honestly, in europe you pay 10 for a $10 game, 50 for a $50 game
:)
yes in japan you do not pay 10 yen for a $10 game...
yet*
>_>
better
change my nick
still dont see why you dont know how to use /nick
Using yen as an comparison is poor >.>
a^
I learned not to play around cement birdbaths, how long to hold blackcats & M60's before they explode in your hand ( I wouldn't recomment it)...what else...
Cypresswork: M60´s aren´t so bad if you have your hand angled right
many evil tricks in a water war (that have nothing to do with water)
ok Jmo4267, a 10us$ game is still not 10 rupiah
Still a poor comparison.
Oh god 18+ ad
HAY Vivix!
Whut?
HI!
Heya Vivix ! :D
steam still need to fix thier policy
I just got a "I AM HORNY" ad with naked girls- on mips
Morning Vivix
dont throw fireworks in the pond >_>
Vivix lol
/me shudders
Nothing wrong with their policy. Just gotta suck it up.
Vivix: Could have been worse. Could have been an Evony ad.
hehehe
Thy words hold truth
How're you doing Vivix?
I'm good, you?
I'm great :3
Ghostery <3
What's going on in here?
Nothing really :s
^
Aww
its kinda ded.
All the mods are away at buck-
:) Where the best entrances to the storm drains were - good times there
but with you here i think we can make this more alive :)
looks like the mods are asleep, post humans
well only chat isn't dead
Being a pillow :3
/me rests on pillow
Boltasar eww, humans
o.o
those storm drains were a great hiding place when the heat got turned up
Stormdrains
?
/me is rested on
Oh
Those things
O.o
We talking about a game?
Nop
>_> i'm not sure whats going
You never will. :>
Stormdrains is where all the runoff rainwater goes, pipes under the streets, some were big enough to walk in
^
yeah
on* :P
thelonepony randomness. That's whats going on now
i knew that>_>
I live on along a creek, so the pipe have to be huge to accomadate all the water, all the runoff flows to the creek
:P
Cool- I've never seen a storm drain, I think-
you have trust me
:)
closest city aint big enough to need them, I think
Go outside damn you Vivix >.>
haha
;__;
I've seen those small water drains, but not you know- those big ones you can get into
Jmo4267 outside? But the sun is out there
And only going outside at night makes you look scary
I know, but it is a risk you must take.
Ah
I dont know the big ones either
I've seen them in movies- looks nice to have in hot weather and such, for curious kids
Jmo4267 can't we jusy open a window and let it count?
Alright you can.
08,01hi all
I know where a huge one still is, but quite hard to get there with all the overgrowth - pipe is at least 10' in dianmeter - as a kid with my brother and both our friends, we never went to far into that pipe - might head down there to find out if I can still get back there
back
08,01i. am. knackred.
:P
:D
08,01but i fee; FANTASTIC
Cypresswork: that's so cool- it reminds me of all sorts of 90s movies
Didicrash?
Nope
o.O
Suddenly silent
Pfft silent.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDF2xfcbv8 CIVILIZATION!!!
08,01buck was, and i say this wih absolute sincerity without a hint of hyperbole, the most wonderful, wonderful weekend of my life
Took several trips down there looking for it :)
Cypresswork: Hehehe- ah childhood
My most nostalgic memory is hanging out outside the gasstation buying cheap gum with powerrangers stickers- the smell of asphalt dust and spring
there was only one bit which i wouldnt describe as fantastic
and that bit was embarassing
:P what happend?
we always got in trouble when we got back - mainly for crossing the street :P - there was an entrance right across the street, was the closest one
and then streamed it
while wrek drew
D: i missed it :s
Indeed you did MaxTheBrony.
I saw that, I think
was it today?
MaxTheBrony it was this sat/sun
:D and then the city came and put bars on several of the larger entrances
I missed that part. I was at church when it happened
Aw man :s
Chrysalis: Eh it was fun seeing you guys though. I know eggwhite and gildash well so it was quite interesting to see them
anyone got a video of it?
how come you guys never responded to my textws
*texts*
You were here on irc then?
We didn't see any texts
o.O
Chrysalis: you were ufb here i think, But i'm not sure if you sen't any messages
I can't recall seeing any either-
the ones ending along the creek are still open, if you can get back there. I'd need a rope, its a sheer cliff on this side
i sent out texts to everyone who gave me there number for the meet on sat
Oh. Right.
Oh SMS
xD
Chrysalis: Oh right that, But i had no way to get called and all. Plus not being able to make it to B.U.C.K
Cypresswork: bring a few friends and try, safely, for old times sake
theres always next year
also, i got myself the swagest piece of armour ever made
hi Chrysalis
Eh?
Vivix : hi i remmbere a chara in FF9 called vivi
Chrysalis: Yep next year is most likely with a high chance when i can attend
that'd be awesome :) Don't have any friends that want to follow me on my crazy whims
Vivi da black mage. :<
Maid_RainBow: Oh? I haven't played that- actually. More of WRPG guy- I was named after Vixen, mivivivex vivex etc
My Brother Kevin might
It would be a mini adventure!
Chrysalis: you mean you got a reproduction of http://www.lightlink.com/armory/specs.jpeg
lol
lemme upload a shot
:O
That's a cool helmet
a bit silly
http://i.imgur.com/yURxp.jpg
haa , thats an awesome patch
:D
http://i.imgur.com/yURxp.jpg
Chrysalis: Haha awesome
hello :3
heya sonicandmario85
You can go Larpa with that!
http://i.imgur.com/LdmL8.jpg
hello sonicandmario85 :)
:O speaking of crazy whims - I have an old local magazine issue that mentions a few ghost stories around Cypress, I've gone to a few of the reported places, however...
oops mis paste in the middle there
It was given to Henry VIII by Emperor Maximilian I in 1514, its funny because the horns and specticals look like those on traditional german punishment masks... and implies that Max though Henry was a bit of an adulter.......
I saw Wreks name on that sheild your lucky basterd :3
Nice Chrysalis
MaxTheBrony i know :D
i might get the strap replaced for one bigger, and use it in a brittania cosplay
heh
:)
http://i.imgur.com/g1Qn2.jpg
speaking of brittannia
that plushie
sold for £1000
Hot damn.
Dat plushie o_o
O.o 1000?
WOW
There's one that talks about a hidden treasure somewhere along Cypress Creek, When Sam Houston was retreating from the Mexican Army, after the loss of the Alamo, it's rumored they buried some treaure
http://i.imgur.com/LWABQ.jpg
GIANT pinkie
haha
dat pinkie
Chrysalis: Isn't that sketchy sounds?
yup
no one's ever reported of its finding
He seems happy
that is sketchy sounds
Holy crap that's huge
petting a giant pinkie pie plushy
i need a Pinkie pie Plushie
I'll look it up so ya'll can get the whole story
Chrysalis: No wonder why he is smiling
Dat Pinkie plushie
I don't think our town has any cool stories- there's this old abandoned house on the mountain side, but that's about it
NOW!!:[
http://i.imgur.com/xnWEM.jpg
Have a picture of the gang you went with?
Chrysalis whats that?
:D
Chrysalis: Dat guy in the black hoody looking at you
Daaaaaamn
id just taken alot of photos
Chrysalis do you have a pic of the Bronystaters?
'fraid not
i was dragged onto the stage at this point
i have one of wrek
Post it :3
not without his consent
Chrysalis: Were there any other bronystaters there that didn't go up to the stage with you guys?
BronyInstrumental was at the event
Chrysalis allright :) sounds resonable
but didnt go into the state event
also, who is best dragon?
Chrysalis: You know a interesting idea for next year is a bronystate panel where all bronystaters go up there
Did All the Bronystaters meet up?
killerpony7733 thats what happened
That's cool Cypresswork , almost noone ever finds those things though- but imagine finding it, even if it's not full of goold it would be awesome
but we had no warning
i didnt because i wasnt there
Chrysalis: Ah well it should be more planned then. And if possible we should get a way to have more time there and just talk and all
MaxTheBrony i was the one trying to organise said meet up, but there was a massive communications breakdown
oh yeah, had i known i could of actually tried to talk about something
WE DONT CARE!
Chrysalis aw :s i would have loved to see all the Bronystaters together :s
but that stage is damn scary
i beleive you
So that way we can all meet too
Cypresswork: hm- I don't really know any local stories, the town I lived in before was.. 3-400 years old, so there should be some. The closest city is -1020 years old or something
There is said to be buried viking kings under the streets near the river, and they want to dig there to check-
...why does it say currently offline when i try to connect to bronystate?
O.o
http://i.imgur.com/SbcsD.jpg
view from the stage
doesnt look scary at all
definately dead. good thing i didnt refresh chat yet
Chrysalis it doesn't look that bad
I see a guy in safar helmet
:D
they queued up
safari*
Dem lights though
for about a quarter hour to get in
Seems like a good bunch
and then it was just 3 people
awquard on stage
xD
what were you talking about?
Wait
Is that who I think it is
A hidden cemetary along Skinner road - now mostly developed, its rumored now that one of the buildings is build over that cemetary, since it has not yet been found
how little we had to talk about
aaand there i said it and suddenly the chat bucks around
Jmo4267 who do you think it is?
aw i would like to have that filmed :D atleast hearing the panel
For a second I thought that was Jeno
that was funny
i only realised this morning
Just my imagination
i should of shipped otakon
:P
which con was that?
buck=
?
Yep
...THERE IS A BAR IN THAT ROOM!
why is it closed?
:s
Dark_Horst there was a bar in most rooms
only one was open at a time though
still, plenty of drink
but we missed a MASSIVE oportunity at the pinkie pie party
they ran out of cider early on
now i'm even more sad i wasnt ther
Maaan
no one chanted
:s
Chrysails:you ended up like rainbow dash XD
no cider
by the end of the pinkie pie party
there were no people
just smooze
soooo, any mods in here? there seems to be a problm with the site
I can't remember anymore involving Cypress, but know a few about Houston & Galveston
What problem?
well their user names are showing
whoever thought a 200 person strong group hug was a good idea thought wrong
oh yeah, that was me that shouted that...
haha

Hi Mlp_Brovakiin

http://youtu.be/KppTmsNFneg Cryengine 3 softbody physics demo, best car destruction ever in a game
Bye DoctoDoctorWho
Ij ust wonder what game will use that physics engine-
Isn't that abit obvious Vivix|Semiway?
It might be farcry3 but this isn't BY crytek, so I don't know
:P
this module is by BEAM NG or something
And I don't know who is using this-
Damn good work by whomever did it though.
I have returned. Did I miss anything?
You missed everything.
Gold_Demona, a lot of buffer time
and hi
Jmo4267: yeahh- Cryengine 3 is looking to be amazing on physics
Tis indeed.
and with modern games- physics > more graphics
On the down-side, it'll be looking to destroy your hardawre.
hardware^
but i meat almost the howl game one team... (a famous show about vid games...)
Hi Invi
that was great :D:D:D
((in germany))
Yeah, but nVidia and ATI are trying to make GPU run Ageia PhysX etc, to make it less CPU intensive and such
some day we might have phsyics cards, PPU as well as GPU
Mm, we'll have to wait and see though.
Jmo4267, it destroys your hardware in HD and in perfectly accurate physics
:P
Hehehe
Ageia was a standalone physics card when it first came out, and the tech demos were crazyyy- then nVidia bought it and made it integrated into their cards
Yerp

Oh, the wonders and horrors of modern food science. I just took out a package of tortillas that's been sitting in the fridge for a while. According to the expiration date, they expired three months ago, but they looked, smelled and felt just like normal. I made a wrap. Tasted fine.
is the stream actually happening cause mine seems to still be loading or is it not happening
Anyone here has played MvM?
Me!
i use the muffin cannon
:D
So much hype over MvM x_x
Gold_Demona, that has nothing to with the fringe, more with the conservation chemicals
*fridge
I didn't say it had anything to do with the fridge, other than that's where I keep my tortillas. =P
Hype? I'm not hyped
yo is the stream on or not XD
There is no stream SaveDitzy
Gold_Demona: It's kinda creepy- but hey, food is food
Stream is a goner!
good
not on right now
/me glomps Vivix|Semiway
i was wondering if my computer muffined out
We are all food
Anotherguy, everything is food
except non food
that is poison
Invi is a genius. :>
Poison is food
slow day...4 hours into a 40+ hour week with 4.5 hours to go before closing time
In the food chain i am a MUFFIN! or atleast thats what my mommy calls me her muffin Lol if you get that reference you epic
Anotherguy, yeah but special food that is posonous, so it's called poison istead of food
Invi: This is very true
i need my serving of poisons *noms on the piosons
nomnomnom
Anotherguy: It is not food if it kills you
Oh yeah?
your the food then
:D
Eat a murderer
lol
but he murdered you
Anotherguy, if you ate it, it can't kill you
except piranhas
take a bite out of his leg before he shoots you :D
Thus if I eat poison, he can't kill me.
they'll eat u in seconds
that is how you eat what kills you
Still no stream?
Nope
nope
when is the stream coming?
im new :)
December 25
Whenever a mod gets around and picks up
When it comes to food, It's eat or be eaten - I've seen enough of Attack of Killer Tomatoes to know about the latter
Yeah, but that's assuming the murderer had any intention to kill you specifically. =P
SaveDitzy: Ah read the rules and FAQ yet then?
*runs*
Holla everypony! :)
Hey GilDash
Hello GilDash

I know I did! :D
Rules? We don't need no stinkin rules (except that lovely list on the rules page *halo* :) )
GilDash i did :P
I didn't :'(
Chrysalis: Yes, I remember. :p
Oh anotheguy sorry
:(
I'll make my own convention!
One that doesn't need my moneh
i probably met some of you there :D
GilDash do you find yourself thinking of LOADS of awesome things that we could of said when we got put on the panel
i wanted to go to buck but i have school soon
:?
cause i keep thinking of things and ending up damn, should of said that when the cameras and people were watching
6_9
oh yeah, if he does it again next year
ill go up willingly
6_9
oh cool
I DID IT!
as long as i get more than 0seconds notice
Rofl
you can have half a secound
sound good?
Lawl
i got a part in Derpy Cardcaptor!
its good to have you back, GilDash :)
Hey guys
Dj_Cyber-4G NICe
Chrysalis: Exactly! I thought he might make me say *something* but not actually *sit on stage and be part of the panel!* XD
I'm talking here from Scotland
Hey Serenity
Hi Serenity
im in wales
Currently in an Internet Cafe
HI!
i play as a Teen version of Doctor Whooves
Was there a dealer's room at BUCK? what kind of swag was there? :)
I'm in a ice cube
Sylandest: Sylly! Did you see me?
how you doing Serenity
GilDash we could of said literally ANYTHING we wanted
Congratulations Dj_Cyber-4G :o
how much otashipping could we have done
GilDash: I did :)
Chrysalis: Well, as long as it was PC.
*PG
all the rules we could of broken
Fine, getting used to the constant accent
i''m in uranes
all the shipping :)
i bought ALL THE SWAGS for BUCK i walked in just dressed in Derpy!
all my clothes derpy
Serenity, everywhere has a accent. :P
we should of just talked about what we actually do
GilDash: I imagine you must be quite tired, hehe, or worn out at the least
Sylandest: I honestly don't know what to think of that. My voice was terrible too from all the shouting at the party the night before.
rather than about how little we had to say
Paper bag wizard is best wizard!
WallDives|Busy: Where I live has no accent
I forget the name
Post something
GilDash: don't worry, I didn't hear you, hehe. If anything, i only got a glimpse. I was terribly busy at the time
Why can't I enjoy things outside of my country? Why?
Sylandest: I've got a feeling it'll either be on Everfree or YouTube at some point...
I'm looking forward to BFF, If there's a dealers room, I'm hitting that first
Anyway
Forever searching
GilDash: either way *shrugs*. I missed ya, hehe
Serenity, everywhere has a accent. Midwest, Mid-atlantic, London, etc.
the lack of a noticable accent is STILL a accent.
is a stream happening today
?
Chrysalis: I wanted to try and turn it into a Q&A session, just so something happened, but no one has any questions. XD
A stream allways happens Sav
kk
SaveDitzy
GilDash entitled, 3 people make absolute fols of themselves
oh, I got a new gem in my email - Zecora preorder has been shipped out - if you preordered a Zecora through Toys R Us, the delay seems to be over and their sending them out
and... crud forgot the name
there was a 3rd up with us and wrek
Also, one last question before I bugger off
Chrysalis: Eggwhite?
Has Wrek played Darksiders II yet?
um do i need to download iLivid
?
No
good
Tell him
If you do you're playing right into their trap
Play. It. NOW
GilDash THATS the one
Anyway
I must leave
Cya in a week or so.
bye
bye Serenity
BYE
Chrysalis: We needed more people up there. Your well known, I'm more infamous than well known...
Hm?
well im gunna go troll Omegle
People? What?
:D
i think we just needed something to talk about
GilDash, sure >.>
a question or 2 would of really helped
even down to "what do you do"
Chrysalis: Exactly. There was just *no* direction at all... I laughed when the brought Denegoth or whatever his name was. He's *never* heard of BronyState. XD
he just didnt want to go up
that was obvious
What are we talking about, hm?
The bronystate stream from BUCK this weekend
Chrysalis: Yeah, because he had as much idea as we did about what was going on.
good evening bronystate! :)
where me, gildash, eggwhite and wrek got put on the panel
Hay DaringDerpy
how've things been DaringDerpy
as planned, alexxm :)
how are you?
i'm good DaringDerpy
overall though
i aint even mad
I swear, I am going to kill the Scottish guy who shouted my name out. XD
was interesting to see what its like on that stage
i have a HUGE amount more respect for all the Q+A panels now
Chrysalis: Oh, I knew what it was going to be like up there. That's exactly why I was anxious about being in the room at the time. XD
the internet forgets nothing :)
do you have a video of it?
i think EFR has one
but we will see
hello everypony :)
I'm not sure I want to see...
Heya BronyInstrumental
Hi everypony :)
Chrysalis: Could you even see the crowd from the light? :S
GilDash yup
hi MegaMoonShine :)
Hey BronyInstrumental :$
iv worked on stages alot so i find it easy to adjust
bye bye everypony i have to leave

Chrysalis: I was really struggling. I love being on stage, but I like a sense of direction too. XD

Hello
No stream? O_o
Nope
alexxm IKR? Finally the US title has recovered some prestige
Aww :(
alexxm OK, so my man, Y2J defeated Dolph Ziggler
Dark92Enigma but given the previous holder has the rematch clause we have to put up with a feud with santio for the us title
wait, we talking Summerslam?
O_o
also, Santino, iirc, has no rematch clause.
alexxm and lemme say, Ziggler was a worthy opponent. No wonder he's gonna become World champion
*CAUSE he will
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzClkMxdsgI some random music
WallDives i thought the rematch thing was for all championships
WallDives he lost to Cesaro three times IIRC
Dark92Enigma, none of which were for the title.
Oh

Just when I got that song out of my head
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Friendship is Magic Comic Covers
Hey Prince
Uhh...
DitzyDerpyHooves, he's just supporting the rules.
We had that link already?
ikr MegaMoonShine
the rules dont say no RP
eqd is derping it up today
Deja Vu! :O
didn't that link turn up a hour ago
DitzyDerpyHooves: Oh and you totally know theres a rule here that says no excessive RP and seriously, A brony? stop assuming something you don't know about me
The matrix is glitching up!
DitzyDerpyHooves, the rules say no excessive RP in this channel, you need to keep that to other channels such as Dashiesauce or such.
I know you more than you know yous
Dashiescauce Nice LOL
DitzyDerpyHooves: And now your a ass hat
Congratz
DitzyDerpyHooves: you feel better now?
I always wanted to be like you!
freakin N00B
And it begins.
Incoming bad trolling
^
i dont plan on trolling
oh come on! i come back to an argument? srsly guise? SRSLY!? :S
Unintentional trolling is still trolling.
Love And Tolerate somthing you havent done calling me a ass hat heh
good one though nice insult
DitzyDerpyHooves: Yep totally not being a ass hat are you?
Love and Tolerate is just a troll thing in of it self, to troll other trolls, and if you really believe in that garbage you really are niave.
^
no shit
I love how those discussions lack so much grammar
ikr Boltasar
Barbetos|AtWork: naive*
BronyInstrumental: I know right? I turned my head away for five minutes...
what?
i might as well get started on that BS drawing now, i don't think i'll be getting many more OCs
BronyInstrumental: Good luck on that
Good Luck
:(
Have fun BronyInstrumental :)
would it really work with only 12 OCs though? it doesn't seem like a very accurate personiffication
BronyInstrumental: Best of luck!:)
still no stream?!
Nope, still no stream
ugh, my neck still hurst from the pinkie pie party at buck :$
hurts*
nemnemnemnem
Is there a new trilogy double feature this week?
BronyInstrumental: I actually use, and when I do I mean it. Definitions of words AND mantras have changed over time in society. I say that mantra to all people, not just trolls, and I mean it. It isn't countertrolling to me. I WANT people to love and tolerate each other, because if we can't accept each other's differences then there is no hope for humanity.
BronyInstrumental: Sorry. Wasn't for you.:$
>.>
dude i just read the rules again where is the RP one
?
DitzyDerpyHooves, under spam.
kk
Ignore my text wall, guys.:$
BronyInstrumental: It was a *great* party though. :)
DitzyDerpyHooves: it includes not acting and generally being something like a MLP FIM character if you really want to be like that, Theres channels dedicated for it
GilDash: yeah, i spent most of it headbanging and/or raving :D
yeh i know lemme do somthing for a sec
BronyInstrumental: Same here. I was right besides Emerald and Denegoth for most of it. :)
meh, i just sorta blended into the crowd :$
are we going to have a stream this evening?
anything=
?
hello
Dark92Enigma: most likely
BronyInstrumental: Did you attend the Bronystate meeting thing?
hello Cameh :)
GilDash: yeah
hi Cameh

I was curious if we were having a trilogy this week myself
Hi Cameh
BronyInstrumental: Did you see me? :$
Dark92Enigma: OI! dont steal my pings!
mitamaking you were talking to Dark_H
Dark_Horst:

BronyInstrumental: Eh, you'd be freer that way. :)
I think Ill take a look on whats on the news :P
Anyone read Fallout Equestria?
Kakumy Its good. Its my second favorite fan fic
It has to be so freakin long though
I've read it
Barbetos|AtWork: fav part ?
It was damn cool
i went to read Fo:E. TL;DR
Probably when Lil Pip gets to Ten Penny tower (or whatever it is called) and meets homage for the first time
LOL BronyInstrumental
Favourite parts of F:E?
I love the relationship they have so much =P
Same here BronyInstrumental. That's why I opted for the audiobook version on youtube. =P
Hmmm...
My favourite was all the parts where Homage embrasses Lil Pip
I never made it past the first couple chapters tho... Hm...
I liked when they were in Canterlot
Y Canterlot?
With the memories of the mane 6
Oh...
Oh wow, they're making a golf course over water :O
I'm back!
That chapter was freakin long though :$
I know that your multi-orgasmic, so I'm gonna make you come till you fall a sleep, after that I'm gonna make you come till you wake up
The sad part is finding out what happens to Twilights parents, specifically her mother. =\
Major: Seriously? WOw.:O
Kakumy: Wut?
What?
That were sad Barbetos|AtWork :'(
Ever read Fallout Equestria Anotherguy and AJIsAwesome ?
AJIsAwesome thats in Fo:E
Yeah
=P
Ok.
AJIsAwesome: aye, some guy is spending $520 Million to build an entire golf course over water
Ya you would understand what I mean't :P
What genre is Fallout: Equestria?
Action, Romantic
Kakumy that isn't there
Other stuff
Crossover/Grimdark/Adventure
Anotherguy: yes it is... It's after Velvet tells Homage that she likes bondages and spanking
that Lil Pip like bondages and spanking
Mmmm...don't recall
D:
I recall the spanking
:D
But just that
Oh, and there's the part where Steelhooves gets killed by the hellhounds
who got spanked
Lil pip alexxm
Lil Pip get spanked by Homage :P
I was like "Dude... the FUCK!? WHY?!?!"
That was the worst part among the story
He just died just like that..
Don't talk about him MegaMoonShine I liked him
"Are we on a date?"
ROFL!!!

How long is Fallout: Equestria in words?
Written by PACCE
600 000 something
I read that chapter as well :$
640k+ words?
wat
slightly longer than Lotr
Pinkies4thWall: 600k over words
MOTHER OF CELESTIA...
but it takes about--3 weeks to read if you read A LOT?
:O
bo bob obo bo
FE PH has I think 700k or 900k
It's soo fuckign worth it if you're into those kind of things
PH is what I'll read next I think- I'm reading Heroes atm
Damn Vivix, soap.
Kakumy: Should be careful cause that is very very borderline NSFW
D;
Sorry ;__;
im going to punch you all in the FACE
FE PH has 945k~ words.
MY GOD.
Project Horizons sound really cool
but I want to finish Heroes and New Beginings first
foe is actually better than lots of other books i've read. books thatwerent available for free
I never got around to reading Project Horizons
Pink Eyes sound cool too
I do not have the patience nor time for reading that many words.
Pink Eyes is dang short
Dark_Horst: Yeah, not everyone agrees wiht that, but it's the best book I've read in years- it just hits all my likes
100k words only
Jmo: i kinda supect thats due to the fact that the author just cant decide on an ending
Hello everone
hai CCCP
Something like that.
Really? Maybe I should read Pink Eyes while waiting for updates
FE PH is long than original
/me hugs Jim

What do if already insane <_>
00,03One moment
MegaMoonShine: Forget santiy, INSANITY is where it's at!
I really want FOE for F1 style game- I just imagine it would be easier to make that into a compelling story
how you doing Scoot-Scootaloo
http://www.redbubble.com/people/sirhcx/works/8873513-steel-ranger-insignia?p=t-shirt
Sanity? In my Bronystate?
gogoling steelranger leads to itneresting results
Vivix It exists
Really?
Oo I want to see
Well, not yet, but it will
Vivix: what'S an f1 style game?
Ah nice, in like F1 2 style? Neaaat
back
Fallout 1 and 2 engine
oooooooh
that WOULD be neat
the insanity!!! http://i3.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/007/260/Twipsycho1.png
No, no Vivix
I love how some steam groups are just killing themselves by kicking bronies...
pinkie pie is best pony
although i never touched fallout before 3
I started playing Fallout ages ago- in 1999 or something?
Insanity is plaguing us now!! :O
but yeah F3 really revived the series, great game
thelonepony: Indeed http://derpy.me/MXj95
/me slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
Apparently FOE by KKat has references to Wasteland, the very very first Fallou game
FO:E the game is a Fallout 3 mod
!! I don't like fish!
1997
Aah
/me hugs Vivix
/me brushes Scoot-Scootaloo's mane
that is quite some old thing to happen in this chat Jmo
Well, F3 mod would be cool too, but so so much more work-
:D Heya CCCP :)
Anotherguy: they did that alrady? does it use pony models?
Yes
Gimme a sec
Jmo yeah F1 came out in 1997? I think I bought it in 1999
/me hugs CCCP. Everypony join in!
I played the demo though, and THAT might have been 1997
I think I'm seeing this...
GROUP HUG

Vivix: well, they did replace skyrim horses with ponies, it should be possible to replace dogmeat with a littlepip
00,03No pings please, I'm baby sitting and this little one is sleeping...

Ok, scoots.

00,03:|

WHAT WAS THAT SCOOTS?!
Pinkies4thWall: That pings him actually
Dark_Horst: Oh yeah, but a full FoE styled story game, you know? Much harder on F3 engine than--well on F1 and F2 engine that's crazy amount of work, but a modern equivalent of those engines
What? oops.

MadSurge: But you weren't on stage with the othe bronystaters
Roid Rage would make a great babysitter

You are so evil xD
OH YEAH, I DID IT

Scoot-SCOOTALOO:AGAIN

Hey CCCP! <3
sonicandmario85, please stop pinging him.
The ping! IT HURTS! D:
MadSurge!!! :D:D *huggies* <3
it doesnt hurt my ears
XD
Well think about us :s
turn down your sound if you hate it so much
Is it me or is the volume really muffled?
do you like hurting your fellow bronies
:(
sonicandmario85: We need to have it loud to here the ponies. :(
i can here them just fine
sonicandmario85, it's hurting the ears of other people. My ears are sensitive to treble, which this ping has a lot of. Besides that, there are always going to be people using headphones.
besides everybody can see when it is imminent.
MadSurge: That's why you need to turn it up and then when the ping happens. EAR RAPE! D:
I don't hear the ping...
im using headphones i have the volume on them perfect
00,03I f I turn it up louder, my pings wil be louder...
But I do hear It's bacon time!!!
ALL the floaty things!
MaxTheBrony: metal kinda makes you more resistant to volume!
I'm using Headphones D:
So MacOS can't discriminate volume levels between applications like Windows 7 can?
Scoots, probably it's just me. I'm trying another pair of old headphones
MadSurge But not against High vollume Ponies :s
diaper wiper....
Dat visible stink
00,03Ma's are okay, but when it comes to streaming... they're meh
XD
Stealth increased to 26
Scoot-Scootaloo:OH YEAH ITS BACON TIME!!
Still a Novice rank
00,03For some raisin, my Scoot pings don't work
I request a kick :3
00,03sonicandmario85: Now you're just playing
lol
He playing with Firee
ban him
maybe because there is an s after scoot or something else, what irc are you using?
slam him into the fire
Toast Him!!
00,03One more peep out of you and I will kick you so hard, you're teeth will have toes
:3
O.O
haha
That was exactly what i wanted to hear
is it normal that the stream is zoomed
seatsea noope streamer is just evil at the moment
:D
seatsea: It's called a EXTREME close up :P
I can't decide who to like Twilight or Pinkie..
seatsea, no. This is what the streamer (who has an obnoxious ping) is doing.
Kakumy like both?
:3
/me Likes all da ponies :3
MaxTheBrony: don't know..
"MY WIDE ANFGLE LENS IS ABOUT TO BURST"
pinkie used stare, it wasnt very effective
*angle
:D
so many eye closeups
Pinkie all serious for the first time in this episode
Okay, calling it obnoxious is probably not the right word. RETALIATORY, that's it.
Kakumy: Why not both *fiesta*
xD
SirGanjalf: I only want to like 1 pony
CREEPY PART INCOMING!
We should watch every episode like this!!!1!!
Kakumy: One does not simply like only ONE pony.

'MURRICA!
LETS PAAAAARTY

GilDash: and hang around with them and talk about ponies and have fun!
Scoot-Scootaloo: What was it?
08,01Ponies47: words cannot even describe how fun it was

*well hope that happens
make a movie of this
Dark_Horst: He was the Chairman.
I don't want to see his "presidental johnson"............:S
oh boy
GilDash: YES!
that sounds stressfull
Making a statues of himself, has a secret underground buker.
08,01Dark_Horst: founder and chairman
MadSurge oh boy, thje party cannon was brilliant
xD
Air Force Wing is best Mazinger
08,01Chrysalis: they were gone by then
That sounds suspiciously familiar...
MadSurge: Nice
This game is ridiculous
Air Force One
YEAH!
for the entire event i thought they were speakers :S
what is this i dont even
then they exploded
MARCO!
Sylandest: Metal Wolf Chaos, youtube it :D
SirGanjalf: POLO!
Caed!
Chrysalis: Oh, I spotted them very quickly, but got so caught up in partying I completely forgot about them until they went off. Needless to say, they were bloody awesome. :)
Rofl who made this game xD
MadSurge: I'm still broken. my head's full of dafaq
I wish I could've gone............:'(
how did that even happen
What's the name of that game again?
/me Burst of laughter
yes SirGanjalf ?
and developed in JAPAN!
Marco: Oh, nothing i meant the guy on the video
MadSurge, second word: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Okay.jpg
SirGanjalf: Metal Wolf Chaos :D
xD
hahahahaah
XD
DNN :D
I give up
08,01so how was EFNW?
this dialouge
xD
i sense a slight undertone of sarcasm in the development of thsi game
08,01i hope it was as good as BUCK
08,01you had so many VAs there, it better have been!
BECAUSE YOUR A DICK
MadSurge: Is that some sort of MGS ripoff?
sonicandmario85: You're
did EFNW take place simultaneously with buck?
Dat code name
sonicandmario85: What are you talking about?
08,01MaxTheBrony: unfortunately not, but we did have a *ton* of musicians
Oh noes
Heck who knows? Maybe I'll make it to BUCK next year :P
SirGanjalf: nope, iit's the game in the stream :D
:P
XD
08,01RainbowCrash88 and his band headlined, and they were AMAZING
MaxTheBrony: Unfortunately not, no.
Dark_Horst, Air Force One launched out of the Reflection Pool in the style of Mazinger Z. This isn't sarcasm. It's just pure Japanese imagination at the expense of any attempt at accuracy.
D:
aw
08,01honestly, you haven't lived until you've heard the Fighting is Magic music performed LIVE
MadSurge: I know, i mean the title sounds kinda familiar.
Holy shit overkill!!
so were the pits
AJIsAwesome: It was one of the best parties I've even been to. Hell, perhaps *the* best.
Kandarihu: that'S hwat i said, wasnt it?
00,03Twilight Sparkle theme live? Holy. Shit.

GilDash|Gaming: Maybe I'll make it next year. Words can not express how much I wanted to go. :/
Ponies47: Next year is hopefully only going to be bigger and better. :)
08,01MadSurge: aye; i just didn't have time to, and me and wrek were the only ones there

There's also the fact that for the sake of recycling the engine from their successful Armored Core games about a single robot blowing up everything, they're characterizing the president as the last line of defense of freedom. In reality, the people itself are the last line.

08,01none of you got to see the main auditorium, did you?
08,01it was closed off to the public

then suddenly i had to run for money
08,01next year, we'll be using that as well, if we're in the Bridgewater Hall again
00,03In fact, forget the con :D

hmmm boobers
xD

08,01everything was so light, because the whole building is basically made of glass
that was such a great place
08,01and has MASSIVE windows for walls, pretty much
Aw man , There was not alot of kids there i have noticed
Chrysalis: I saw your whole person and heard your voice :D
00,03This is so... MLG
Thats a good thing but yeah :p
08,01so it was such a birght, happy, and fun place to be, and i think that really added a *lot* to the con
yes i know MadSurge
Is this a cover of something?
that was such an embarrasing event
is that a xylophone or a keyboard with a xylophone sample?
08,01sonicandmario85: not at all; everywhere was air conditioned
yeah a glance at me bouncing on the right :D
Dken2021: a keyboard.
00,03if someone can find me a Twilight theme, that'd be great~

AJIsAwesome: I'll be taking plenty of video
FillyFlam: At BUCK, of all places.
MadSurge: OH, yeah. Is it a remix or something?

00,03And I have already said enough about EFNW.
Ism
Scoot-Scootaloo: Okay.
EFNW?
Scoot-Scootaloo, this is a warcrime. It's no more funnier than rape jokes. It's even worse than rapejokes.
Isn't there convention that forbid that?
Chrysalis: that's how luck works I'm afraid :(
Only a cartoon can take that much nutbuse and live.
oh everfree
wait, people broke into tears because they didn't win a raffle?

Buytoast they spent 200 pounds on tickets for said raffle
the character behind huey is reffered to as the 'White Ghost"
Dats a lot of crumpets!

08,01Buytoast: well, it's not pathetic; they just didn't realise how statistics works

08,01see you Ponies47

00,03Yeah well, some people are crazy :P
Wayne Industries?
Hey, what're we talking about?
Scoot-Scootaloo, I don't want it to be offensive, it just is.
when they played freind in deed for the odeon
seeya MegaMoonShine
i like those guys
that was a MAZING
what is it with being offended, nothing happened
I'll be back later. I always come back :P
Who's offensive?
derpy scene, then flimflam song then derpy scene again
MURIKA
08,01Chrysalis: i missed that
Oh.
00,03Just turn off your brain, let yourself loose, and go with the flow~
Derpy is offensive only for REAL dumb people
The Flim-Flam Brothers are offensive?
00,03Or you can just mute the stream and chat with the others~
/me sits on Scoot-Scootaloo's head :3
I'll be back later :3
Scoot-Scootaloo, I am NOT going to turn off my brain for something like this.
Derpy is not Offensive at all :s
the whole run went word for word through the entire derpy scene
twice
derpy is awesome
08,01GilDash|Gaming: awesome
room*
Scoot-Scootaloo: which is waht I did :D
dat "fit"
08,01Chrysalis: haha! that's epic!
RD and derpy parts
08,01oh nice, there's someone else on this train tethering with a phone
00,03Whether you like it or not, I'll continue to stream this series, because I want to, and several people like it too.
08,01i'm gonna see if i can hack it
x
hell they restarted it from the beginning
seems legit
^-^
haha
and people bood
MadSurge: No. She isn't. One definition of "Derp" is clumsy. If you watch the episode, she's clumsy not retarted. I know what you meant, but you didn't phrase it well.
Chrysalis: we just don't know what went wroooooong~
cause they wanted derpy not AJ
00,03Don't like it? Complaining about it won't do anything~
boondocks is great
isnt this the season 3 finale? "Its goin down"
It weill bring is Seaponies wont it?
Then i will complain
:D
08,01just for fun! i'm not goin to do anythign nasty!
I like black people doing black people things.
its the ball cracker
Previously on 24...
AJIsAwesome: that's I'm saying, only dumb people find Derpy offensive
SSH sometimes turns itself on on my ipod
Scoot-Scootaloo, being silent about this will only affirm complicity in this.
3 times this happens :D
O_O
this is Scoot-Scootaloo http://gifsoup.com/webroot/animatedgifs1/3573902_o.gif
And some guy hacked it when I was at school once
MadSurge: You mean dumb as in ignorant, right?
xD
O_O
00,03mmhmm Chrysallis
AJIsAwesome: yep
lol
boom
lol
then...
O_________O
what a crappy love life
seems to have bad luck with women
MadSurge: Okay. Wish you specified what you meant by "dumb".
What's SSH?
XXXXXXXXXXXXDDDDDDDDDD
So many white people in this episode.
:D
00,03also, with all due respect, I won't listen to any complaints about what I stream... unless it invovles buffering :|
dat lack of buffer
lol
Scoot-Scootaloo: keep on trucking!
Heuy Freeman is a misanthropic, cynical 10 year old
Then I have to take responsibility, because you won't.
PillowPoni: a secure connection protocoll
he is very intelligent for his young age, and very skilled in mutliple forms of hand to hand combat
Can we calm down about the stream? You don't have to watch it if you don't want to.
dat cow
moo?
08,01GilDash|Gaming: rest assured, my hat is firmly white
Dark_Horst ok
08,01hehehe, i'm a pink hat hacker!
08,01i just do it for fun!

AJIsAwesome, if it were something personally offensive, just ignoring it would be a perfectly valid option.
XD
08,01GilDash|Gaming: i'm to nice a person to do malicious thigns
house wives STRAIGHT OUTA COMPTON!
crikey. there be a thunderstorm drawing near
Buffers - now that IS offensive:P
/me sigh
There's alrady a thunderstorm here.
08,01i smell really bad
Kandarihu: Look, I don't like this show either. This show is purely satire. The characters are based solely on stereotypes, so even though it's not the right profile to represent people it's not supposed to be offensive.
hiya guys
what's up?
hai otakon
It's like I said before. If you have a problem with the stream, don't bother watching it. I'm not yalking about this anymore.
hi otakon

Heya SuperBrony64 :)
If there were were a new season of Boondocks, and one episode were to spout the common anti-Brony stereotypes in the same way this show is spouting all the other stereotypes, would I still be the only one to have a problem with it?

otakon: yes.
twilight_sprinkle: enope
otakon: and why not

twilight_sprinkle: well we'll see in 30 years
Scoot-Scootaloo: I got a set of Munchkin-like cards illustrated by the RainbowDashPresents guy :$
Scoot-Scootaloo:i saw it before
twilight_sprinkle: dry acting, too much CGI
So...close...
Just alittle bit more mechanics,...
Soooooon
00,03sonicandmario85: good for you
I think I am gonna go off to bed, ttyl guurlzz.
00,03MadSurge: I didn't knw they made cards :O
The thing is, I have stuff I want to go do, but I have to be on guard whenever you're streaming SPECIFICALLY because of stuff like this.
00,03know*
Er, that.
Night Boltasar
Bye Boltasar
otakon: not all of the acting was dry, hamill was for from perfect too. and the Cgi was good, so it doesnt mateer how much of it there is
then after an hour of this, lets get an infinite loop of the starting screen for Pokemon mystery dungeon: explorers of time
nite Boltazr
Boltasar: Night!
Scoot-Scootaloo: it was apparently a BUCK exclusive
even though blue/red rescue team was better
00,03oooh!
Goodbye Boltasar
It also makes it hard to enjoy other mods' streams, because I have to make up for lost time.
twilight_sprinkle: there were two good scenes, the tandem fight and the wookie combat...the second being WAY too short
otakon: i know what buck is :) i said buck because i wasn't there :P
Scoot-Scootaloo: I'll have to scan them it seems! :D
00,03I'd love to see them!
otakon: im they were all good scenes. the only things i didnt like was anakins acting and and high ground thing
*imo
Scoot-Scootaloo: don't expect anything quick though, I'm galactically lazy
SMILE
Didn't you say you were going to stream a How it Should have Ended?

twilight_sprinkle: in a SEA of horrible dry acting and a shoehorned love story that made Twilight look authentic
hai fluttershyftw
smile smile smile
fluttershyFTW: a collection of pony music
o
00,03minor lag incoming...
awesome remix
get to the anti lag bunker
It is Tombstone ofcourse its awesome
:d
/me dusts Nittany_Discord "hello there!"
otakon: seemed like a perfectly fine love story, and for once, love isnt the ultimate good and its demonstrated how it can be evil, which is rarely done
/me 11,01fluffs PillowPoni. Hi.
>it's Tombstone of course it's awesome
yeah no
...
im in canterlot jail and im smiling :)
again?
Heya Nittany_Discord :)
hai Nittany_Discord
hiya Nittany_Discord
so, does ANYONE know what movies we're watching this Friday?
huh, Phyllis Diller died
Hiya Nittany_Discord
Buytoast: really?
CrimsonPhoenix: ya know its funny tomb has the same sentiment there
twilight_sprinkle: I'd say the intention was OK. Execution on the other hand...
11,01Hi MaxTheBrony, twilight_sprinkle, otakon, MLP_Brovakiin, and everyone else.
well hi there Nittany_Discord
Nittany_Discord: Holla! :)
00,03I personally don't like any remix of the Smile song. It's already good on its own...
also guys guess what? dj pon3s eyes arent red they are pink like rainbow dashes eyes are
SirGanjalf: what was wrong with the execution
Spectrum_Rush|Sad, I'll give him a point for acknowledging that
11,01Hi NocturnalBlade and GilDash|Gaming
Scoot-Scootaloo, now you're talking
Hello Nittany_Discord! You wanna hear me gushing about BUCK too? :D
yes otakon
my stream froze
huh?
Enough with Vinyl Scratch eyes debate. Take it somewhere else.
11,01What about BUCK MaidSurge?
they are red
period
o hey Nittany_Discord didnt notice ya for a sec
ANY shade of red
00,03It's a hat.
but it's red
GODDAMMIT Wrek BOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Nittany_Discord: best weekend ever! :$
twilight_sprinkle: acting, for example. There was just no chemistry between Anakin & Padme imho.
why is it just a wite screen on mine
nvm
11,01Awesome.
MadSurge: i could have gone to BUCK too... but well, istead I had a PARTY!
ash ketchum hats
EW POKEMON!
otakon:proof:i saw her eyes in the season finale of season 2 she had her shades off and i saw them
we're looking at pokemon hats
I guess I agree about remixes of Smile, at least as far as it being fine on it's own.
hey pokemon hats
Eli: that's awesome too, you know
sonicandmario85: yh and they were red right?
pokemon?
otakon:nope
00,03:3
otakon: Kinda magenta.
heya XAX :)
XAX: THAT IS A VARIATION OF RED
Scoot-Scootaloo: i agree
Hi MaxTheBrony
RED IS ONE OF THE BASIC COLORS
Eli: We had a party too. With cannons and everything! ^_^
THEREFORE IT IS THE BASE
HER EYES ARE BASICALLY RED
otakon:they were pink like RDS eyes dont believe me? watch bronies react to seaosn 2 finale
MadSurge: yeah, it was awesome. I had fun, lot's of old friends i haven't seen in a while
Then again, in my love for that song, it seems to have gone the way of all earworms.
Scoot-Scootaloo: So you've seen the manga I take it
otakon: OKAY LETS NOT GET TOO TECHNICAL
otakon: They were magenta in the show. People are getting into big debates about what her eyes SHOULD be.
sonicandmario85: PINK IS A VARIATION OF RED
otakon: if that makes you happy then yes, they're all kinds of red :D
XAX: that's what I'm TRYING to do
11,01Scoot-Scootalooshack.
NO OTAKON, ITS A VARIATION OF BLUE
:p
11,011-hr?
:I
Red>magenta
WOW, it really IS an hour from now.
RD eyes are magenta ¬_¬
otakon:THEY LOOKED LIKE RAINBOW DASHES EYES
Red>pink
00,03I read the manga during my pokemon battling days. It was meh
11,01I guess no more Boondocks :<
Lol'd Soupjuice
Nittany_Discord: Eeyup
Er, an hour
sonicandmario85: okay yay
WHY ARE WE ARGUING ABOUT RED
xD
>:I
fluttershyFTW Vinyls eyes
Scoot-Scootaloo: which manga there was many
i thinks
oh
Eli: I met people from the chat and Ponygoons, it was great talking about ponies <3
inb4 otakick again
ok that makes sense
fluttershyFTW: we aren't I'm trying to explain that ALL the variations what people think Vinyl's eyes are, they are basically red
stop with the color of the eyes discussion really
00,03I read all of them, up to Gen 4. The Issuh one was stupid >: (
08,01teehee
08,01hello from stolen wifi
SirGanjalf: i already said that anaking acting was one of the two main problems of the movie
Scoot-Scootaloo: Sinnoh :S
Scoot-Scootaloo: Really? You thought the manga was meh? I thought it was awesome. The first few arcs were amazing.
if we are going to watch any more boondocks (probably not) it has to be about stinkmeaner
11,01Did you have fun at the convention?
red or magenta hmmm 6_9
08,01i'm not sure if i should tell this lass she has a really insecure password
00,03Oh I read the sinnoh ones,
I CHOOSE ORANGE
08,01i think i will
00,03the first few were awesome! I loved the Johto one!
08,01and hoepfully i won't come off as a creep
favorite regions in the pokemon universe guys?
Avoid the slap
just lean back when you tell her
:P
00,03My favorite series, by far, was the electric Tale
Isn't the manga what the original creator of Pokemon wanted Pokemon to be?
MadSurge: real party canon?
Scoot-Scootaloo: I haven't even seen the 5th as I quit about halfway though the 4th gen
DOIT
haha
Scoot-Scootaloo: ah yes the one thats borderline eroge :S
DO IT
XAX: :D
Eli: 4 of them. They were brilliant. :)
08,01XAX: ha! but no.
xD
Damn.
almost xax almost :)
00,03That's the one! And Gen 4 had an interesting story, miles better than Issuh
Eli: *BANG* *confetti everywhere* :D
08,01i'm about to get off my train
Scoot-Scootaloo: Issuh is gen 4
08,01i'll speak later
08,01see you all!
Allright
"No im not, im a chicken" lol love that line
Cya Samsa
see ya
MadSurge: i'm gonna skim some vids of BUCK until i find it. i wanna see that canon
00,03Uh, no, Issuh is Gen 5
You know what? I've been thinking about wanting to recreate Chitti in the Phantasy Star Online 2 Character Creator.
One of my favorite Pinkie Pie remixes.
Scoot-Scootaloo: Gen 5 is Unova
twilight_sprinkle: And i agree. I just wanted to point out that it affected the overall reception.
11,01People will download a car once 3D printer technology catches up. :p
AJIsAwesome agreed
00,03Unova and Issuh are the same thing, silly :D
Nittany_Discord: I would download a car.
Scoot-Scootaloo: woops nvm my mind derped
Spectrum_Rush|Sad: Issuh in Japan, Unova in NA
11,01And 3D printers become cheap enough for the general public.
:p
we can only afford ponies
00,03there was Kanto. Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh, and Issuh (Unova)
not cars
Nittany_Discord: Personally, I think JDL not turning up was the only downside to the entire thing, and it was vastly overshadowed by the quality of the con. :)
^
see ya
SirGanjalf: imo it wasnt that bad, and minus his acting and the high ground thing, imo the movie as excellent. it had a good mix of character development, politics, action, philosophy
JDL ?:)
Bye fluttershyFTW
Bye fluttershyFTW :)
11,01MaxTheBrony: John De Lancie.
BYE
11,01VA of Discord.
Ahhh
yes yes I know i just forgot for a sec Scoot-Scootaloo havent heard unova called issuh since before gen 5 even started
I'm torn between him being a Mar (human male) or a Cast (robot male). The Casts can have almost humanlike faces, but the bodies are nowhere close to being human. Maybe I should just make him Mar, and just figure that magnetism = photons.
MaxTheBrony: You know? "God of Chaos?" XD
GilDash|Gaming: the only shameful thing is that there were no show guests, as opposed to Evertree and the CMC panel :|
Q
GilDash|Gaming: xD ye ye i get it :p
I have 2 autographs from John de Lancie :S ya'll jelly
Spectrum_Rush|Sad: O.o
Spectrum_Rush|Sad: Very. :|
GilDash|Gaming: lots of music, yeah <3
