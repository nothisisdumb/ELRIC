London ain't all that grand :P
:) OK, I trust you - I'm off
I hate mornings -.-
can i bring pokemon to work ith me?
Its a beautiful day in the barracks.
Bronysith: I'm not sure why he hates London exactly.
I personally like it, it's not the best city in the world but it's fun.
And the public transport system is awesome.
must be nice not having to drive
If you live in London, it's honestly easier not having a car.
Personally enjoy driving
There's so much traffic and so few parking spaces that you might as well just take the bus/tube everywhere.
Placebo: i dont like the quick time events
NewSuperBronyU go to bread
/me glomps NewSuperBronyU
i hate the small bus
Although Bronysith, I do have to ask, why exactly did you link something from my tumblr in here whilst I wasn't even around?

Bronysith: Don't worry about it, I'm not too fussed or anything, just seemed a bit strange.
Plus I don't like coming off as an attention whore or anything.
ScootaChicken: i was linking cosplays i thought were good
ScootaChicken: speaking of which, are you gonna do kaworu?
Phase4 iddqd

Bronysith: I'm completely broke right now, but if I had enough money to get the wig I could, seeing as I have all the components of it clothing-wise.
i had to refresh my page
ScootaChicken: yea, just not the plugsuit part >.>
Phase4 you has consoleSS?
But I'm not too keen on doing cosplays of things I don't actually like that much, seeing as I never really got into NGE.
ScootaChicken: then do that haruhi cosplay
If I do it I'll just wear a short sleeved dress shirt and black trousers.
Bronysith: LEL.
Still haven't got the uniform :P

05untill its sweet but not icky sweet
05then eat with strawberry or blueberry soup
Dear Princess Celestia. Exactly 24 hours ago, I realized (although I guess I already knew) that people's chatbuffers still last more than the 30 seconds that The HUB used to display spoilers of the upcoming season. When that ad comes up, it's best to just ignore the ad altogether.
and then SUGAR RUSH
how about a vanilla pudding filled chocolate cupcake?
or bacadi with red pfanner ice tea
05hmm
052 bits of ice
05milk
pfanner?
05vodka and lkaluha
pfanner is a brand
oh
or
I only drank bacardi mixed with coke
tasted terrible
05rum n coke is the only thing that works
05but even then its meh
05and you get sick of it easely
Im not a fan of it either
peach schnaps then bailys and blu curacao and a shot of grenadine
looks crazy
when it comes to long drinks, but not cocktails, I prefer metaxa with carbonated ginger (like kinley)
00,02time for sleep
or plainly just beer
or hot met with bluberry and cherry

dub*
sorry, lame keyboard
oh well she'll always be derpy for us
^
yes! :P
:)
wait let me get one of my comic strips
She also got the "fixed" eyes
but hell...i like the voice and its fine
Her eyes are not always misaligned :D
they put much more effort into s2
And S3 so far is even better :D
there even is a german twilightlicios video
i think
lol
http://i.minus.com/icDF8DD4XpQzm.gif Still the cutest thing of the show yet :D

/me bonks Socks's head.

Jake LOOOOOOOOL
holland
test test test
nowait wrong
how did they even manage to do that?!
ah now
much better
hi SirWrathy
<--- former RivaLz , hi Lil_B again :P
i use my TF2 nick from now on xD
well, cue wrtong Language for the Intro, like the kids notice.
NIck manages to f*ck up a lot of stuff
they aired hearts warming eve instead of last roundup
their schedule is always wrong... etc
and they started S2 with EP 25 - 26 instead of EP1 Return of the Harmony.... xD
they did this on purpose
kinda weird
But the Translation is slightly wrong again, Cider=|=Apfelsaft, Cider=Apfelmost, but most kids wouldn't know what "Most"´is anyway
... what?
SirWrathy: When was this?
Yeah, they started with Ep 25/26 of S2 everywhere in europe
Socks when S2 aired in Europe
they had to start with ep 25 because of the new toy line
Wow!
That is silly.
royal wedding ponies and stuff
Did they then air eps 1+2 after?
at least that wave had good blind bags
Socks: yup
Or go in backwards order?
Jake: Wow
That is.... WORDS ARE NOT ENOUGH!
it was 25+26 the 1 then 2 and so on
and today it was ep 15
5 eps per week
O.o
wut...
back when s1 aired it was 9 eps per week (5 new ones)
Jake wow, the younger looking Flim Flam Brother sounds like a Hetz-Redner at one point xD
dun dun dun :O
Jake: So let me get this straight, in europe, they aired 5 new episodes a week?
indeed
For series 1 only?
Socks yes
Good morning everypony :)
Wow...
My mind is blown
Socks they also have all the eps of S1 to watch on their site
mo-fr 9:45 or something
Lil_B: Which site? *frantically grabs at keyboard*
Good morning BladedWings :)
nick.de?
darn it i have to go now be back in 1 - 2 hours :D bb everypony:)
Socks if you want to watch it in german that is :|
Damn it'll be in german :(
i think it was nick.de
Jake yes
Bye SirWrathyAFK :)
bye SirWrathyAFK
Socks: good chance to learn it
Well... Mind is blown, not sure why but it is blown notheless

Jake I just found another fail in the ep
pinkies double layer voice?

wtf happened? Quality Controll! WHERE ARE YOU?!
the quality control is only beating the vo's to talk faster
05hit play

ohey, Gangam Style has now more Views than Justin Bieber's "Baby", good, I guess
ok ill go now and probably be back later
see ya
Lil_B: anything is better than Bieber :D
Lil_B: i'll take GANGNAM STYLE anyday......HAPPILY

MadSurge I know, but I dfon't really care for both :P well, of coursae Gangnam > Bieber if I really had to decide :)
Wrek: Veemi streaming looks pretty good :)

05hello?
Wrek: hello!
05the stream workin o?
05r
Wrek: perfectly
MadSurge Its a good and catchy song, and it doesn't take itself seriously if you know whats the lyrics about
To be honest, I have the money for the Complete Edition in my Steam Wallet, but I'm putting myself on probation. Truth be told, the money SHOULDN'T be there.
Lil_B: the video itself doesn't take itself seriously :D
Yes, Wrek. The stream is working fine, although it kinda looks like you've got low-res textures.
I cancelled my WiiU Preorder for a new PC... maybe I should actually finally order it >.<
finally wanna play my PC Games on maxed out setting :P
like ANNO 2070, Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams and Dark Souls

Hey HavokOC!

samurai jack yeah
So
I just watched a good movie
did he say shit nobi?
05NDA for free work? i think not
And the dress comes off
Samurai, Light Mode!
shinobi
Oh this is awesome :).
its just the regular "don't talk" agreement

08,01any audio nerds in tonight?
Possibly me :P
08,01HavokOC: know about mics?
I know some things
oh right we also need people for background music
Jake what do you wanna do?!
we are going to make a game
08,01okay, i have 2x STC-2 large diaphragm condensors, and 2x STC-1S small diaphragm condensors
08,01both are cardioid pattern
i have one with trust logo...
08,01though the STC-2s can be switched to omnis
You can tell the art department wsa having fun with this episode.
08,01most of what i do is orchestral recording, but i'm considering getting into video sound engineering
Jake I'd almost say I'd make some music, but I got no time, and I'm porobably not good enough quality wise
08,01i have the offer of a Beyerdynamic MCE86 shotgun
08,01i'd also be getting 2x beyerdynamic Opus 53s out of the deal
08,01but i don't really have a use for those
once our forum is ready you can "apply" for our project if you want to
08,01i'm just wondering whether it's worth me getting the MCE86
08,01i'd essentially be getting these for free, as a swap for my bass guitar
/me claps.
08,01should i do it?
I tried applying for the MLP Zelda game, but theyx never wrote back, that's just rude
05amy keating rogers :)
EEEEEEPPPPIIIICCCC :D
I LOVE IT!

That's beyond my knowledge, sorry >.<

well we have 2 programmers 1 musician 1 modeler and 1 2d artist (me) so far
"Welcome to the Salty Spatoon..."

SuperBrony64: Seeing how Nintendo is usually a family friendly company, you used the word B******, even though you centered it.

Yeeees, more
Dat FIREBENDER
... I love this show...
did they ever make a final episode for this?
naturesfury: Not sure
Wasn't this show on toonami for a long time?
Pokecolt: One of th ebest ones
05i was there when it first aired on CN
05good times
no, i dont think it had a proper finale
and it probably wont
DBZ in the original days was the best thing toonami ever had ever.
Agreedm Wrek.
Wrek: back when Cartoon Network was Cartoons.
*Agreed
seeing as how aku's VA is dead
Hmm, shetting VEEMI's aspect ratio to 16:10 seems to make the time portal actually circular.
Cow and Chicken, Dexter's Lab...
What more Wrek ?
05i am weasel
XD
What more..
052 stupid dogs
Oh yeah PPG :P
05droopy the master detective
Yeah. I also fondly remember Cartoon Cartoon
Ed Edd and Eddy is still the hands down best cartoon of the old days.
Wrek: Gawd...old... XD
so many good ones
all gone now
Swat KATS.
Buytoast: ;_;
And Ed Edd and Eddy was the most short lived of all the cartoos as well.
dat inner peace
i didnt care for Ed Edd and Eddy
05top cat
Thunder Cats.
Wrek: Flintstones/Jetsones if that's your cup of tea.
hmm...
Swat Kats was cool
Yogi Bear,
i didnt like dbz or ed edd and eddy
SuperBrony64: hi
twilight_sprinkle: THat's understandable.
DBZ got old quick
No one forces samurai jack into slavery.
D:<
05dbz never aired on CN when i had it
Ryunosuke: And we all know why. :P
hell, dbz is probably the worst anime ive seen imo. it wouldve been fine if it were 6-7 times shorter
Yeah, CN did not use DBZ I think
I remember when adult swim had futurama on at 10pm.
Those were good days.
DBZ was on Toonami for a long time.
DBZ was aired on Toonami, IIRC.
twilight_sprinkle: watch dbz kia
yeah, Toonami had DBZ
05i recall ozzy n drix
Two Stupid dogs...
05not the best but it was watchable
oh shit
my favs shows were <--that one, jimmy neutron, dexters lab, and ppg
ozzy and drix was... interesting
Wrek: Oggy and the Cockroaches? :P
Ozzy and Drix
Meh
I could watch it, lol
i still remember some of that theme song
naturesfury: whats that?
I am surprised no one said rocko's modern life yet. xD
loved Oggy and the Cickroaches as a kid
twilight_sprinkle: an updated shortend dbz
I remember Ozzy & Drix on Kids WB.
oh and courage ofc
05yeah ozzy n drix was onyl good through nostalgia atm
rocko's was nick though, wasnt it
05yeah courage
Pokecolt: That was Nickeledeon
COURAGE
<3
Yeah. But regardless. x3
Also, Samurai Pizza Cats.
i didnt care for courage either for some reason
SPC was awesom

Hooray, overrated song just beat an overrated song.
Heyo browniestate
Hi, Hoody|Skool.
AJIsAwesome: What overrated song?
Gangnam Style.
Don't tell me your on the spriggle side
-_-
hi Hoody|Skool
Hi Bladed
I was fine with the song at first, but now it's just plain annoying.
hey, PSY deserves that spot
AJIsAwesome, Gangnam Style isn't overrated
Kandarihu: it is overplayed
Alright, amybe not overrated. Overplayed, yes.
*maybe
It is still awesome
AJIsAwesome: I think you mean overused then, not overrated
When Gangnam Style is combined with an ICP song, you know its overused :D
It's an "okay" song to me, but it gets more acclaim than it really needs.
AJIsAwesome: well at least you arent insulting people who like it
Bronysith: Of course not. That's their opinion, and they're entitled to it.
In that case I agree with you, I've seen this song waaaaay too many times
Vordox I have a question... or rather a Problem
Lil_B: Yeah?
AJIsAwesome: yes, you know how you can have an opinion, it is when you start insulting other peoples opinions is when you are now an asshole
Rrg
This chat gets along too well
Hoody|Skool: eeyup, we sure do lol
Hoody|Skool: Why would we be each other throats?
Anger blinds.
*be at
Anger is fleeting
Anger is pinged
hi there; no stream? :)
Hoody|Skool: But it is a strong force.
nope anon
No stream at the moment, pony_5205.
no stream
hi pony_5205 and nope stream just ended
AJIsAwesome: well earlier today i linked a pic of my friend cosplaying and then some asshole said that cosplay is bad and all cosplayers are disgraceful
Bronysith: Who?
Bronysith: Well then that's not the right thing to do. He shouldn't insult their interests, regardless if he doesn't like it.
I haven't slept in 25 hours~
Hoody|Skool: You should sleep. :S
AJIsAwesome: FUCK THAT SHIT
Hoody|Skool: go to bread
I have bread
Hoody|Skool: Go to bed?
Hoody|Skool: Try to beat 38+ hours, that is my record :3
No bed at school ;~;
MLP_Brovakiin: Mah record be 37, yo
yes there is, its called a desk lol
Not good enough
Hoody|Skool: I win! \:D/
Yeah, if you stay up too long, you start hallucinating. You don't want that to happen, my friend.
MLP_Brovakiin: I can beat you
AJIsAwesome: and then he was all, Oh now im being insulted for having an opinion, cause me and another guy were defending our friend and cosplayers...but he said he was insulted, after insulting all cosplayers, which is an assholish move
Hoody|Skool: Try it >:3
AJIsAwesome: Oh hey slendy, watchu doin here?
Hoody|Skool: ?
/me hugs AJIsAwesome
Do we really have that many idlers? >.>
maaaybe <_<
sorry, i was stuffing my face
Hoody|Skool: Yes. :D
wait a second there boy
wait a darn second
/me waits
Someone needs to put the clip of Scootaloo's drum solo to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlhLaNClgw
seconds over
if you're going tor ecount events from earlier, at least recount them correctly
instead of flat out lying
What's going on?
Bronysith spun a false tale there
Eddmario: Best.
i'm the asshole he's referring to
Scene
Evah
never said cosplay itself is bad and that all cosplayers are disgraceful
i said it's disgraceful if they start doing it and such and acting like the character in a setting that doesn't call for it
Buytoast: So it's not cosplay, it's bad acting you don't like?
attention whoring more or less
no wonder these guys live in celibacy :D http://derpy.me/CcztZ
also, I like how you shut up once Bronysith came in
cosplay all you want at a convention or party or what not
have at it
I think what he's saying is that there's a time and place for everything.
jsut don't do it in an area where you have no buisiness doing it
pretty much
I agree with that
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo-tWlETq8w
Can I cosplay as a naked man at home?
if that's how they were interpreting it, no wonder they were flipping their shit over what i said
same for ponies really *ducks*
But L is just standard dress wear, a shirt, and pants
pony_5205: Nah, it's cool. I understand what you mean.
/me munches on his popcorn
well he had that eyeliner on with the messed up hair and the barefeet
it is cosplay
and he was sitting all scrunched up like an egg
Was it GOOD cosplay?
never watched death note so i cant say
but according to him it is
Ah
Do we have a photo of this cosplay in question?
for perspective
I would pay money to see a guy walk to school in a gundam suit
^
Im already planning on that actually Hoody|Skool
Sometimes, you gotta make entertainment for yourself
aha, i know what pic this is about
that shit's nasty
Eat fresh
Well i'm off to class, see you guys later tonight ^_^
bye BladedWings
Bye, BladedWings. :)
latas BladedWings
my programming teach is wtf
bye BladedWings
he said he doesnt care about the logic as long as it works, then he takes 10% off because i wrote a function to normalize 3 vectors at the same time, instead of 1 and calling three times
was a pretty important assignment too
got the results of one of my exams, and I paseed. yay :)
you want wtf programming moments?
/me has programming to the fullest extent
*Hates
i'll give you one
Grammar help, An eagle or A eagle?
Congratulations, Alchemist! :)
An
i had no clue what to do for any of my assignments nor my final
Should be an
i handed in garbage
Metronome: A eagle
i got a B- in the class
er
depends on the context of the sentence
Metronome, an eagle
Buytoast: well isnt that your fault?
Metronome: can you give us the sentence?
Metronome: fail
Buytoast: HAX
I saw a/an Eagle
yeah, i'm not much of a programmer
an
Metronome: Ah, that would be "an"
ITS FUCKING AN
Thx guys
it wasnt my fault my teacher cant decide on how to grade
Where would you use "A" eagle?
although it didn't help that he doesn't really teach you, so much as makes you take his code and plug shit in like a mr potato head doll
How about Uniform?
and if you dunno what to read his stuff like you won't know what to do
Metronome: A uniform.
^
Metronome: were you not taught before on when to use An or A?
Just to be sure, thx guys
Just say it out loud, and whichever one sounds better works
^
An if the next word starts with a vowel or sounds like the beginning of a vowel like you would say An hour because the H is silent
twilight_sprinkle: What's with the square box?
I believe it is an hour...
Yeah, an hour
Bronysith: Yep.
AJIsAwesome: idk, its some random encoding error i occasionally get. it meses up my / commands too
twilight_sprinkle: Ah, I see.
god hats u spriggles
i kno ;~;
but i hat him 2.
and i wil keel him
found a pen, should I steal it?
eat it
of course
Hoody|Skool: Depends on your morals.
AJIsAwesome: Whats a moral?
fish?
as i thought
eyjey pls,hoodis have no morals
\:3/
Hoody|Skool: Concerned with principles of right and wrong or conforming to standards of behaviour and character based on those principles.
god suks :I
i hope he doesnt exist, or ill kick his ass
AJIsAwesome: PFFT I have no morals
and now religious crap
Yay religion!
I'll start
Discuss Dusks Dawn
So, how's the weather?
Or how about what you ate recently?
Hoody|Skool: lets talk about or god gaк
ok, that word still works, good :>
Who would win in a fight, Bruce Campbell or "god"
twilight_sprinkle, that's got to be one heck of an ego you got there to be willing to judge God, AND think you could hurt him.
Judaism is the only religion I can name that hasn't done anything harmful to any outside group or person
Hoody|Skool: ...
Bronysith: I'm not very edumakatid
Kandarihu: i was joking for the most
Thank God I'm an atheist. :)
Kandarihu: but i will judge him same as everyone else if he exists
NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERDS
Bronysith: We're talking about religious practices, not bible stories
So, seen any any good movies lately?
anyone i need to get to my class, bye
*anyway
The Dictator sucked
Hoody|Skool, but they did
latas twilight_sprinkle
How's Wreck-It Ralph?
fashionably late as always~
does anyone know if it was G Major or G Minor which is often used to extremly detune music?
Lil_B: G Major.
Lil_B, G Magor, I think
Kandarihu: K. They killed one of their own. Not harming an outside group or entity
If I remember correct.
AJIsAwesome: Kandarihu thanks, I'm currently listening to something in G Minor and thought "wasn't this this tune most of this creepy Videos have?" thanks for the Answer :)
Hoody|Skool: I think you meant Bronysith in your messaging, right?
AJIsAwesome: Either or
pretty quiet
/me rolls in on a tumbleweed
<---
pony_5205: You know you can change your nick with /nick, right? :)
:D
AJIsAwesome: Thanks, I did. :)
You should change your nick to HoodyIsTheBest
^
Please ;~;
:3
:D
Oh, you guys! :D
So, as it turns out, it's illegal to throw shovels at people in Arkansas
Question: Would you guys consider Mario Party 9 a good Mario Party game based on what you've seen? :)
Who knew :I
pony_5206, lol. It's annoyingly hard to use autocomplete to ping guys with pony_#### nicks
AJIsAwesome: Yups
I like almost all the mario parties
AJIsAwesome: i ahvent played a marioparty sense like 2
I have all of them except 6 and 9 (No pun intended).
What pun?
60....
69*
69 is a number, grow the fuck up
I didn't know 6 existed until MUCH later, and I'm considering getting 9.
Ohh, it was a math j^-^
*joke
:3
3:
MLP_Brovakiin, no, it's a dirty joke
Hoody|Skool: I meant that for people who saw it as a sexual joke. I'm not that immature to make that kind of a joke.
AJIsAwesome: You acknowledged it as a sex joke, therefore, you are as much to blame
I'm to short to 69 :(
*too
/me pulls pony_5206's legs longer
Hoody|Skool: I acknowledged it as one so that people who initially would make an immature joke as that would understand that I wasn't trying to make one.
there always somr1 out there for you
AJIsAwesome: Okay okay, I can't troll you, gosh >.>
Howdy y'all!
Hi, Everlasting_Joy. :)

No clue
Wait wait wait wait wait; there's an item... in TF2... that isn't a hat?
AdamTheDuck: Ah.....
DarkColt: BLASPHEMY
What is this
Everything I know is a lie T_T
;~;
AJIsAwesome, no different from the normal bat other than showing how many hits you get
AdamTheDuck: Okay, So it's just a cosmetic weapon?
I don't even play scout :3
AJIsAwesome, pretty much, that and Jaymoo can now slap people with a giant fish
This is getting annoying :/
I'm considering playing the class when I get the game.
Regardless; I intend to watch the full series tonight & tomorrow

Eddmario Eeeyup prepare for bans
inb4 banhammer
Hey, I did a warning. Plus, you don't HAVE to click that link.
Oh but you linked it
it is still against the rules :I
And that's against rules numbty
Eddmario: doesnt matter, rule is no linking whatsoever

Hello everypony.
Hai Nyra :)
Hi, Nyra. :)
How've you been, Nyra? :)
killerpony7733: On accident. I meant to link to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37gZjFrFRaw but my stupid clipboard didn't replace the ED link with the YouTube one.
hai Nyra
Well, got some good news and some bad news.
oh great
drama
lol
Which is why afterwards I warned that it contained spoilers, while the YouTube link is a random MLP vid
Eddmario: You posted the link and then said spoiler, don't try and wing it off :I you know what you did...
Eddmario: http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/24675690.jpg
Eddmario: doesnt matter, no spoilers link whatsover, no fucking excuses
Good news = Crew for Film is growing, slowly, but surely. Bad News = Hasbro is trying to cover their ass, by asking me to place on my info sites, that they are in no way affiliated with the project. I guess they figure if the film tanks they wont be brought down with it.
For everyone that was looking at Wrek stream during Black Lagoon
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKisi3jJhKQ
dat trixe
Funny how legal works, huh?
what film?
someone linked a spoiler eh?
It bugs me because now, I dont have the added benefit of saying its a team-up with Hasbro, but whatevs.
Whatcha gonna do, right.
Yeah
oh, he left
Buytoast nah link is fine, people still don't get the spoilers rule
Boodfire: "what film?". I recently payd for the legal right (copyrights) to use MLP as the base for the first ever fan-made full length feature film for our fandom.
Nyra: what's it going to be about?
Ponies , presumably
nope, do not want spoilers
Nopony wants spoilers on here? Do I have to private chat?
never mind didn't know it was something that big
Do you still want to know what it is 'generally' about?
As long as it doesn't have to do with spoilers regarding later season, sure.
*later season

http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&v=nn1ehKAo3ak&feature=endscreen So who wants to see this Anime?

Bronysith: I'm talking about it in general. Not about the video specifically.
AJIsAwesome: i know, but people still get it confused all the time
people look for racism too much nowadays
Isnt racism a type of stereotyping by any chance?
PinkieDash: i dont get it :/
black guy got arrested? ohp, definitely racism
Alchemist: no
its all dem white cops fault
Bronysith: how so?
Alchemist: racism is the false assumption of one race being surperior to another
7quick on the uptake there Stormles.
7... Stormbles?
Alchemist: stereotyping is "all blacks eat fried chicken"
7English is a fucking stupid language.
Bronysith: i thought that was nationalism, the firs ti mean
twilight_sprinkle: no
Bronysith: I always thought its just assumptions based on race.
twilight_sprinkle: that would be one nation being surperior
Metronome: Y U No think before you spoiled!
hiya guys what's up?
Bronysith: but thats what you said
Hi otakon :)
so dead stream?
Bronysith: and what you are talking about was racial supremism

Vordox: no we didnt :D

Also woot AskPeachy|Drawing
part of the reason Razz pissed me off so much was because she called everyone names like that. Ugh.
wtf is that
7It's a condescending term of address. The point is that it's terrible: the aim is to make the object feel inferior.
so did anyone else try the Shoot thing?
alexxm: ok then, i was afraid there was something wrong with my connection again

4chan isn't nico
Shizuka: I think my brain melted....

dat Trixie CrystalPhoenix
yeah
my brain melted
if anything it would be 4chan that's nico and not the oposite

I haven't found it yet
Or anyone else here who likes anime know which it is?
Anyone else here who likes The Offspring?

It looks like a Kyoto Animation production
http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/424/638/ac3.png Also, something disturbing.
Vordox, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ky%C5%8D_no_Go_no_Ni

Meh, I guess I can go to YTMNd then
Vordox: what about dubstep?
EY everypony
...
I might have to shoot you
havent visited in a while, been busy recently.
for such a wrong comment
Haio, everybrony.
I kinda prefer dubstep over Eurobeat
^^^
welp, back to lurking
Dubstep is ok
But Skrillex sucks
Ive never heard Eurobeat, but dubstep is the worst O_o
:P
Eurobeat Brony uses the same frikkin chord progression every single damn time
let the opinion battles...BEGIN
Im not too big a fan of Dubstep, but at least theres variety
Yeah I prefer TLTS
WOAH!!!
tlts?
wut?
The Living Tombstone
TheLivingTombStone
ah
otakon: its an additional thing to the fact that I dont like the music in the first place
I love Super Pony Beat! :[
WoodenToaster is best
dont know the acronyms and such
:P
Archie V >>> any other pony artist out there
by far
Dubstep vs Eurobeat = http://z0r.de/316
WoodenToaster and Alex S need to collaborate if they haven't already.
Who is Archie V?
is there a stream?
ill link his channel
just got the jak ps3 HD trilogy

Random question: what color would Lyra's magic be? Yellow?
Hes under a frikkin record company hes that good
http://chickenlittlemishap.ytmnd.com/ WA-WA-WAAAAA
CountDoofus: same as here coat
Ummm no
Wouldn't Rarity's be white then too?
green
most show it as Gold like her eyes
No green like her mane
My favorite collab song is The Astronomical Astronomer's Almanac to All Things Astronomy by Makkon and PinkiePieSwear
ah
Green like her mane
RaveBrony: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_k8Ektoqg8&list=UUAUFghZx1Ny6cskefHB6VpA&index=23&feature=plpp_video
one of his works
Twilights magic is purple...
Raritys magic is purple
stop distracting me Bronystate :I
Lunas magic is blue I think.
Cadence's magic is pink
Rarity's magic is blue
^
I'm colorblind
...
./ignored
derp
i cant take the stipidity
I love Eurobeat tho, its just so much fun to listen to, haha
What color is Celestias magic?
Well, Celestia's magic is yellow.
Celestia is gold magic
RobotdragonX: wrong
Yellow, gold, that.
She has 3 magic colours so far
gold yellow WHATEVER
*flips table*
What color will Sweetie Belles magic be?
I'm thinking light purple.
RaveBrony: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvSIArLL9SA&feature=BFa&list=UUAUFghZx1Ny6cskefHB6VpA ?
maybe?
When?
Sweetie's should be green since here eyes are green
I didn't see it
I think her magic should be lavender
Celestia is te goddes of Sun. Therefore her magic should consist of all colors.
*goddess
Oh yeah, Sweetie Belle's magic is green. Can see it in the latest episode, at 2:00.
hello
Haio BabSeed
welp im out for today, n8 and bb everypony :)
sweetie has green magic.... ._. ....changlings....
here we go
Later SirWrathy
Guess I won't get a response on Archie's stale form
Its too...simple for me :(
If only he didnt take down PPS >_<
Hey guys! Brohoof /]
RobotdragonX, light green
oh...*phew*
swag
wait. what color was Vinyl's magic?
Im not saying his music is bad!
Its just... rather simple for my tastes
RaveBrony: Simplicity is the strong part for any music
RaveBrony: The simple songs are the one who stick in your head, not theother way around.
RaveBrony: So he is focusing ont he better backbone of his music, although some are required to listen to several times to get the feel of it.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9K18CGEeiI Always a fan favorite
O.o
RaveBrony: Like I'm listening to Archie-Best Night atm, and I can hear he has alot of thought into it
my dads going to make me go to prom.....i wont let him...bring it.
RaveBrony: However, he's using the same technique in musi for most of his music, so he's not really..."Swinging out" form the safe zone of trying his own style.
Shouldnt it be a surprise? lol
AJfan77, cause you're expecting presents?
If I can say so. :P
im getting portal 2 and overlord
.....
people these days
IS EVERYONE IGNORING ME?!
FINE!
Im putting my money on one more http://soundcloud.com/archiemusic/krewella-alive-archie-remix
CrystalPhoenix : If you don't like me, you don't have to reply to me.
*pets Vordox*
Where did Vordox go?? D:
presents are nice and all but not mandatory
Cuz greed
RaveBrony: maybe he rq'd because i /ignored him
Twitcha Twitch Yay! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_05CTz1FbFs
who knows
:L
I Love it when my cousins from Texas come for the holydays ^-^
CountDoofus: I wouldnt know XD
naw, is that people expect gifts
AJfan77, you believe in jesus fine, alright
I believe that in alternate universe this conversation isn't happening.
AJfan77 /)
Sillieh you
:P
I'm just not very fond of people who ignore other people when they were joking
It's like if you are at war with a country, just /ignore and nuke
Dem kinds
Also, going through all o Archie's music atm
and....errr...
"variation" is not what I would call it...
Because Lyrics
I guess
Im more into 'Trance'
He made on dubstep song, i would have no idea if you would enjoy it or not
Oh trance eh?
I hate dubstep o_e
yeah Archie is House/ Progressive House
Oh yeah...
ignored
If you want trance, PinkiePieSwear is your guy
._.
orchestral music is my fav for the most, the more epic the better~
RaveBrony: mind tell him to /unignore me?
epic violin is always cool
you will defeat an evil overlord with the object right of you, what is it?
i like the violin a lot, wish i had the patience to play it, but no chance there im afraid
You guys know what time it is?
Outside of pony music, Id recommend Armin van Burren, Ferry Cortsen, and some others
for trance
hammer time?

RaveBrony: Urgh, thanks anyway.
Vordox: Np :\
RaveBrony: Let him ignore me. =P
I don't care, atleast I listen to people with opinion rather then shun them
Vordox: truth of the matter is ive had you on unignore the entire time

oh there was much rustling when it happened
Well I kind of violated my principles in using /ignore at all.
i decided to sleep in that day unfortunately..

Is that a stadium? LD
EverFree Radio tore into the new episode.
:D*
so much babs seed music
actually, i' confused
how come there's so much remixes of that one song?
Sketch_Toku_Brony i think it could work i mean it's pretty simple to do 4 characters tryingn steal stuff one trying to stop them it's basically one of those old caper movies as a series
'cause there's multiple remixes of every song
Dark_Horst, attention whoring
people wants to be famous
SpeccyRush: but there's nothing BUT that song lately
that'S not normal
and I do admit the song was the catchiest yet
but yeah remixes now are stupid
honestly? cant hear it anymore
too much
I say
Dark_Horst: most recent song gets the most priority, besides all the other songs this season were remixed right of the bat too
Original>every remixes and covers
I can't remember the crystal empire songs
before the premiere aired
oh well. maybe i just click those eqd links at the wrong times
Speaking of which, I just heard 3 different versions on Everfree Radio in the past 15 minutes.
SpeccyRush: Why not spend...time...quality?
Dammit Larson why you spoil of next episode https://twitter.com/M_A_Larson/status/273210581299888128/photo/1
I'll check and see if the remixes even sound like the original.
Vordox: hmm what now?
still waiting for spikes death metal song. come on, somebody do that
it was emntioned on stream
you must do it
it is law
SpeccyRush: Time and Quality on your songs instead of "pushing" them out?
Thanks, Mitch Larson -_-
Version 4...
Vordox has the right idea
Sketch_Toku_Brony if a lupin does get a movie who do you think will play who
Vordox: don't ask me, I'm an artist not a musician :P
I'm nobody
=P
SpeccyRush, those who rush to do their stuff shouldn't be considered artist
and I'm not a rusher :S
i remember daniel ingram tweeting that they actually made a "hard rock" version of the babs seed song
IYKWIM
i'd really like to hear that
Dark_Horst: I want to hear the good CMC song
got a certain one in mind?
havent been up to date lately

Dark_Horst: And I want it badly just to hear it. just once.
Hai lonely
ohai bronystate :3
Vordox: oh, you mean that from the talent show
i heard applejacks singing VA will be gordon freeman
lol... version number 5. Though, this is The Living Tombstone version I'm hearing now. Can't be bad.
yeah, that might be interesting
Dark_Horst: Yeah
twilight_sprinkle: Speaking about Gordon Freeman..
A SECOND!
GETTING A MASTERVIDEO

twilight_sprinkle, isn't Applejack singing VA Ashleigh Ball?
alexxm: im good, you?

twilight_sprinkle.....I didn't see it that way
good one
"Heeeeeeeeere's HAZARD!"
night guys
done with Hw
Night alexxm :)
So, what did everyone think of S3E4? I wasn't here.
btw, that vid was on 9gag this morning. HOW'S THAT MAKE YOU FEEL?
Hazard, only one picture can describe what I thought of the episode
Night alexxm :3
Night alexxm
thelonepony: NOW BURN THE WORK
It was cute and fun. I shouldn't feel that was about a bullying episode, but oh well.
I thought the song was awesome. That's pretty much what got it for me.
HoodyNinja: okay >:3
/me burns the homework >:3
/me eats the ashes
Every year, I pile all of my homework in a compost bin and set fire to it.
http://derpibooru.org/163124
At least Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon got their just reward in the end. Happy about that.
Hazard, this pretty much is the episode for me http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_me2g7eixbK1r5el02o1_500.gif
that's all I needed to love it
CrystalPhoenix: so daww :D
I wanted to like Babs Seed more than I honestly can. Maybe if my mind can create some scary headcannon or something.
i like babs
Sweetie Belle, Y U SO DANG ADORABLE
wait... nevermind
she a good ponii
I freaking loved that song. I listen to ALL of the remixes whenever I can.
.....yeah ok no
I HATE the remixes
funny, i dont even remember that song
And no one noticed Dr. Whooves in a pear costume
original>all remixes and covers
CrystalPhoenix: I beg to differ
Hold on
No seriously
HoodyNinja: God the irony. And not to mention the polka dot bow tie. :D
all remixes are rushed
and I do hate the whole thing about remixes
and how they are published in EQD
it's like a race to fame
Someone make a Klezmer remix of Babs Seed
disusting
Dr. Whooves
http://i.imgur.com/v00Kls.jpg
Anything that makes it to EQD is worth my time.
HoodyNinja: lol man they hide them so well :D
Tovler, hmm, I think it can be done
Not sure if it should, though
I'll bring my clarinet
HoodyNinja: That's fucking awesome! I absolutely love the references.
Hi... :/
oh yeah Pears! i remember now :D
And by the way, the song is called 'Bad Seed', not 'Babs Seed'.
and in today's episode of "from the bottom of my fav-list": http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWgbMJZupGM

Yes, let the pain flow through you
Dark_Horst: is novacaine the usual stuff they use?
/me smiles evilly

twilight_sprinkle: you pinged the wrong neighborhood
I scrolled up and down my list of favorites and stopped on a random video. Here it is: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAKc674CFdA&list=PL6FDD136D5D40B61D&index=165&feature=plpp_video P.S. WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?! :D

"Twasn't my fault" Declared the naughty prince
Holy [buy some apples], Tim Buckley from the CAD comic made one about ponies! <3
more remixes http://i.imgur.com/47AkI.gif
I seriously wanna do a shuffle vid to a remix of Babs Seed
DarkColt: so is novacaine the usual stuff for cavitys or is it extra-strong for root canals?
Hey
CountDoofus, I hate CAD
I did it again: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzjcS0DRxog&list=PL6FDD136D5D40B61D&index=163&feature=plpp_video

Ohai dabi *huggles the dabi*
twilight_sprinkle: Just standard numbing stuff. They shove a VERY thin needle into your gums, and it numbs you for about 2 hours or so; completely in that area
Hi Syn_Virtu
Hazard, heh I posted that here before
Flafi <3
/me hugs flafi
CrystalPhoenix: I swear to god, I just scrolled up and down and picked a random one.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrE2zRtFWBA&feature=bf_next&list=FLAViXIrbp86kg5lvVfFdQuQ
Hazard, by before I mean like a couple of months back
DarkColt: yeah that i know, its just that i heard root canal fixing hurts like hell, i had some cavities fixed last wednesday actually. they used some interesting thing on my gums that slightly numbed my gums before using the needle
CrystalPhoenix: Want me to try again?
Mhm, I got that too
try what again?
CCCP: But it's closer to Chanakkuh! :O
\ o / 8 days, come at me bros.

i bet its lesson zero
;)
part dues
Hi Dat1FugkyMuffin
I hope it's the special Derpy episode
Hi gears
CCCP: Hello, I am Fugky
no derpy episode
heck no BG ponies episode
I just realized. Some of the old 3 spoilers have to be fake based on syposis that have been leaked so far.
CrystalPhoenix: Luna. :P
Tried it again: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBI3lc18k8Q&list=PLFA1702028C369179&index=47&feature=plpp_video

SnowCat: link to tthat poll?
But noone is listening to me
https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-DvALCIxvTYg/UK_RfMkMLjI/AAAAAAAAMvI/riBPyaY5CrI/s1600/ProtectingCrystalEmpire.png
Which is sad
Vordox: you mean the pony on the right?
twilight_sprinkle: No, 16:16 North lane, second row to the right, mid
is der stream
it was tied but people keep yelling at me to draw fluttershy
no stream atm

SnowCat: whoops, looks like I evened Rainbow and Flutters again :o
oh nuuuuuuuuhhhhh.
You see her twilight_sprinkle ?
:(
wait… No, that might be Cloud Kicker
Well bye everyone :(
Bye CCCP
fluttershy is in the lead!
Tovler: That's not Cloud Kicker...
leaving so soon CCCP :'(
Vordox: you mean the scene from up high after showing the cliff, or the scene after than where theres a cabbage float passing by?
bye CCCP
twilight_sprinkle: During the overview of when the apple leaves the ponyville.
Kinda sucks how Derpy was demoted to Waldo status... I hope she gets a bigger role
Late CC... Gone. Blech.
oni_link, she's always been in that role
Tovler: Cloud Kicker doesn't have BROWN eyes
Or Lightbrown, as Derpy
Been trying to tell people about her for a few days now
But given up =P
CrystalPhoenix: Well yeah but I mean that she had a shot at a bigger role but then the soccermoms got offended
Hello everypony! How are you all? (I heard the video stream was hacked! what's up with that?)
Her waldo cameos were awesome in May the Best Pet win and that episode with the Smile Song.
oni_link, cause you want Daisy to talk more?
i just found this chat and i think its awesome ;w;
This shadow-of-a-doubt crap doesn't fly
hello Crono_brony
Hai
you want any pony#12423542523 to talk more?
OFFLINE?! S:
gonna play some gta
If I only had 1080 or higher version
Vordox: you sure its not the yellow haired pony thats 3 seconds later as the cabbage goes by?
I could take a better picture. :(
F*ck dis
the show isn't about Derpy
stay for a bit
:'( I want stream
oni_link: was it true that the stream was hacked?
and she has nothing to offer to the main cast
its fun when there isnt a strea,
CrystalPheonix: It isnt?
stream*
Crono_brony: yup
Crono_brony: Hijack
it was hijacked
Vordox: yeah thats not derpy
oni_link: Huh, why would somepony do that?! (ironically, the theme of the episode was bullying.)
The real Pinkie is dead
twilight_sprinkle: How can you tell?
Crono_brony: yup
Crono_brony: The hacking?
Vordox: the brown horse is near her during the high view, and then a few secs later when the cabbage goes by you can see them up close
GoldenBrown eyes, Grey colour body, and Golden hair
ShadowQuill: yeah.
I think....I am going to find and download Adventure Time
Crono_brony: who else but brony-hating, hacker trolls?
And not to mention, the same hair?
!
Hio !
http://img838.imageshack.us/img838/9164/derpyhuhjpg.jpg
Lol Hi
^---- There
CountDoofus: haters just don't understand us, you know?
ik u FlutterdashBubble
CrystalPhoenix: yeah but I demand more fan service. Its like when a community made item or map makes it to a game you like. Its a nice nod to the fanbase
Vordox: like i said, not her. you can tell by the brown horse which she's near
:O HOW!?!?! /]
oni_link, I say nay to fan-service
Cause we r in the same room
Crono_brony: naw, it was idiots who are mad that we like a show that they hate
once in a while it's cool but if the show is runned by fans it won't last long
CrystalPhoenix: Meh
:O NOOO
Crono_brony: haters don't bother to understand us. Though, there are some bronies that don't know when to quit, giving us a bad rep.
twilight_sprinkle: You... don't know how Waldo works do you? :P
run**
:D yesssss
That's called a SCENE swap
00,10refresh and or press play
Vordox: CRAZY THEORY TIME! My guess is that Derpy being on the train in the intro means that she's not currently in Ponyville! Derpy is travelling the world!
damn I hate my grammar
so much
:[ NOO!
urgh I give up...
:D yesssss
NEVERMIND, wait till a higher reso comes out and you'll see
I will eat the trolls.
My eyes! They see things!
Sumica SHTREEEEEEM!
Vordox: what about waldo? shes the same grey pony with yellow hair thats in the next scene, which isnt derpy
:) Your Funny. Im not there lol
Dat tank
YES
Vordox, there's a higher resolution then 1080p?
CrystalPhoenix: I don't know, I hope so
<_< Uh nooooo...
Hello!
i just got her whats wrong with the stream
Dude stop lying
A Sumica stream :O
I see the eye colour, hair colour and shape, AND Colour of the body
That's Derpy
sumica: forgot to op?
Yay!
00,10hmmm woder when I dc'ed
:P Lol
00,10no my auto op broke and cant figure out why
I want stream :/
SO I think I know why there was an orange on that stream that day... I think it was a reference to this http://derpy.me/EmXoC
CountDoofus: Thing is, most of us aren't like that, I just hate how we are all quickly judged. We deserve a chance to show that we don't act like the way that they think we do.
Vordox, or you want to see them so much you're hallucinating them?
FlutterDashBubble: hit Refresh
now she looks even more like Cloud Kicker in this video
you're also missing a caital there sumica
Crono_brony: Amen.
CrystalPhoenix: No, I see them cause I am near sighted =P
Vordox: you cant tell eye color on a size of that resolution
00,10ah what?
twilight_sprinkle: I've been doing pixel work over over 15 years
I see pixels
/me has joined the channel. GOD I LOVE RP.
capital S sumica :P
00,10meh
sumi if most nights/midnight hours in woodman is gonna be the NC taking over everything it's gonna be fun
I think that since the whole stupid "Gak" thing finally died down (for good I hope), it should not be an auto-kick. Remind me again why it still is?
Dat auto kick
Hey everypony I'm back, finally
00,10cause people still bring it up
Yeah, no one says gack anymore
I HATE THAT BUCKING WORD
Until the next episode and its commercials. Then it starts right back up.
still people brings it up
and then, it'll be in this week's commercials.
welcome back AssertiveFluttershy1
And it looks like somethings finally happening
shouldn't have posted that.
STOP SAYING GAK
Haio AssertiveFluttershy1
That word was actually in the link, lol.
But really, gak is getting old.
GAK!
UUUGHHHHHHHHH
hahaha oh you guys
magical lycra?
Vordox: but still like i said, even if you can somehow see a ccolor of a pic thats such a small size, in the next scene you can see which pony it is
I'm stupid.
:[ Spaaaaace
POOTIS
twilight_sprinkle: Don't talk about Scene swap
Vordox: unless you say they replaced her, which is unlikely
They did
ouch that hurt
Is that THE AssertiveFluttershy, by any chance? The musician?
Nope
sorry
Aww.
Vordox: and in the overview her eyes arent derped in any case, and frankly i dont see a yellow color. it could just be your eyes seeing things differently, that varies from person to person
they replaced here odd cameos like Pear Dr. Whooves and. Strawberry Shortcake Sparkler
I'm assertivefluttershy1
diffrent channel on youtube
either way, she looks purple
brb, I'm gonna see if I can get a higher reso screen
Gotta investigate
My stomach, she be rumbling. I'm waiting for my dad to finish making the lasagna ;3;
oni_link: ;~;
Dat feel
Who was the worst troll this chat ever had?
Vordox: im looking at it in 1080 p
hi yo
you
ShadowQuill: We have trolls?
/me hugs HoodyNinja
Vordox: i can upload a screen shot to imgur if you want
wacha´doing
oni_link: i know that feel ;~;
AssertiveFluttershy1: I am hurt
Probably the one that hijacked us saturday
Either my brother or moneymaster93alt2@tormail.com, the bloke who hacked this place.
twilight_sprinkle: What colours are the eyes, and is the hair spikey?
Or claimed to have done so.
HoodyNinja: Damn that /v/
IT WASN'T /V/
/me also reaches out to hug thelonepony|GTA4
oni_link: Hopefully you get filled up from that. I just had thanksgiving leftovers. X3
It was /b/
Ah, Nanoha
okay, it cant be any 4chan boarders
Bye the way guys what anime is this
?
00,10was not any of the chans
Crono_brony: I'll make it my mission to do so! XD It's just me, my dad and my nephew so I'm pretty sure I will :P
00,10it's a lame excuse for a stream site
Vordox: i think there might be one spike, but the eyes look grey
Okay.

Grey O.o
]
\
Who has that colour setup...
sumica: so it was a rival stream?

00,10they have some regulars that frequent the chans and supposedly gnaa
00,10not rival
What anime is this?
the other stream site was so jelly
00,10not even brony related
Yay!
During the ep pretty sure it was the GNAA
let me guess, they did it for teh lulz
I still don't understand what's with the slashes and letters. /v/, /b/, what have you... Someone feel like explaining it? :$
00,10part of them
I still don't get if the GNAA is srs or a troll group...
I wonder what would happen if I mentioned..................
gak
Vordox: like i said, i can upload to imgur in 1080 p if you want
You get the boot.
oni_link: Have you seen their full name, if so, what do you think?
Thought so
is like dlipping tables /v/ )) i___i
oni_link: perfect! yeah, you should be full. ugh, I just ate 'till i was full, and now mentioning lasagna (might of spelt that wrong. XD) makes me hungry again!
flipping
CounrDoofus: It's just the extentions used for the adresses of 4chan boards
CountDoofus, in 4chan you have a little menu at top or bottom with all the board sort as /a/b/c/ and such
for short we just use the slash and letters
twilight_sprinkle: That would be great, I got some zoom tools. :P
:( in Hearts and Hooves, zoomed-out Derpy definitely looked like derpy :(
00,10she never realised
oni_link: stupid name for a group, am i right?
Crono_brony: its cause lasagna is good food! :D
thelonepony|GTA4: very stupid
mmhm, indeed
da faq
were is the love;(
oni_link: Eeyup!
Oh, gotcha. Never ever been on 4chan, honestly. Seems like a "do not enter" zone to me.
okay back
Crono_brony: /) for lasagna!!
what's on stream sumica ?
/me *sigh*
CountDoofus, well yeah since it's anonymous so the replies are very raw
00,10nanoha
CountDoofus: its not for everyone honestly
CountDoofus: never go to that site if you're gonna be buthurt
while there are rules, some people thinks they can do anything
trust me
CountDoofus: It really is a "do-not-enter" zone. I browse it because of obsession with internet culture
What is this anime PLEASE!
oni_link: (\ FOR LASAGNA!
<CountDoofus> is a site full of cloppers and shippers
00,10best to not go to the site period.
^
00,10the front door is a trap
WHAT IS THIS!!!
lel
fact
its a trap!
I'm too corrupt for 4chan to affect me anymore
Turkey Tetrazzini !!!
but I'm still sane enough to chat
and i'm still waiting for this guy to start the match :|
Yeah, sounds like sound advice, sumica. My mind is already corrupted enough :p

eeyah?
00,10it was not hacking
twilight_sprinkle: The most common colour within the area is light purple...
I wanted to post a link to a 4chan thread that I think might go over well, but if there's a general concern about system security, I guess it would be a bad idea right now.
twilight_sprinkle: Of the eye.
00,10it was poor security on mips
Vordox: heh told ya :P
nyeh
twilight_sprinkle: Yeah with this size I could zoom into the very pixel depth
00,10the stream key can be seen externaly
And confirm, that is Cloud Kicker.
this new episode ... is gone to be just awsome ...i want to see trixy vs twilight
oi
spoilers
hmm
00,10mind the spoilers there
too late
lol sorry
Vordox: also, look at the exact first frame of Hearts and Hooves Day. It has zoomed-out Derpy and Cloud Kicker in it.
Derpy and Cloud Kicker are friends :)
Vordox: yeah, i thought they were grey on the smaller pic too tho, guess im more near-sighted than you, which is probably treue actually :D
d
nyeh
Yesterday morning, I speculated about an upcoming episode while an ad for the season in general was streaming. Wrek kicked me, so I honorbanned myself for 24 hours. I held to that ban all the way through.
but hey, already seen the title. and now i'm preparing for the big, fat, "HA! TOLD YA!" to throe into all your faces on saturday
/me glomps [SWAG]Haku
it will be very satisfying
twilight_sprinkle: Well, that's quite sad...
/me is glomped
twilight_sprinkle: I really mixed up the hair sticking to the eyes as golden. ;_;
did anyone see that video that a brony explain the real speed of rainbow?that was just awsome
Vordox: yeah my brain did that too, i had too focus on the eye to unsee the yellow
ohai [SWAG]Haku :)
So meleeman, we take spoilers seriously here. A 24 hour ban is the PROPER discipline for spoilers.
What up with the GTA4 thelonepony?
Kandarihu: well on the other hand, i dont think anyone has managed to avoid spoilers for that ep
[SWAG]Haku: playing, but waiting for this ass to start the game :|
/me engages terminator mode
Bummer
thelonepony|GTA4: since when can your pc handle gta 4 >.>
twilight_sprinkle: no, xbox
00,10So I did notice somthing with the hub ads
twilight_sprinkle, it doesn't make it alright to talk about it. You never know if someone has managed to avoid the spoilers or not.
who plays gta 4 when they cna have planetside?
I hear spoilers, inform me so they may be eliminated
thelonepony|GTA4: o okay
I am going to bed now, goodight everyone :)
the New Lunar Protectorate needs YOU! *point*
Night MLP_Brovakiin :)
Goodnight MLP_Brovakiin
and hello BronyState :3
00,10they have been taking steps to change the context of the spoilers they show

HAKU HAS A QUESTION TO ASK Y'AL
Do Your Part!
00,10such as the g3 face pinkie
Haio AdamTheDuck
Hai AdamTheDuck :3
Should I drop the [SWAG] off of my name?
Kandarihu: i know
Dark_Horst: *whispers* they need you cuz they suck.
im tired of explaining it to people, and its even started to get to me now
but maaan, i cant wait til new ep, eez gunna be soo awshum /)^3^(\
Ohai AdamTheDuck :3
[SWAG]Haku, it would be cool to, it's kind of annoying typing [swag] to tab your name :/
hmm hmm
/me noms on AdamTheDuck :3
DoctoDoctorWho: if only. my observations so far have shown that we are pretty much the only thing that makes the NC win SOMETHING
this is probably the first time i actuallt cant wait for an ep
/me licks thelonepony|GTA4 :P
except the last two days
twilight_sprinkle: same bro/)
Naw, it gunna suk, twoiloight_sprankle.
those were a miracle
probably given by luna
meleeman: (\
Should I just be Haku then, or my usual online name of Haku1013?
sumica, it would be best for them to just joss us. Build up expectations one way and turn it all in a different direction. That's one of the things I like about One Piece.
deeweearr pls, u gun eet dem words on saterday
MUSIC
YFW I can't eat.
:3
you dont eat at all?
DashWithRainbows: everything okay?
there are rumors about they gonna put the episode in itunes this friday
Mmhmm.
Nyeh
I was capable of freeing myself from 2 of my extra IT units.
Nyeh
00,10yeah they had that rumor last week too.
I actually got some decent sleep.
00,10it was wrong
DashWithRainbows: IT?
burn
Those moments when you have so much on your mind, you can't formulate a sentence without tripping over your own toungue when talking to someone -_(\
Dark_Horst: hmmph, I guess you'll just keep your heritical ways and I'll stay in celestias benevolent light.
Information Technology.
Computer stuff.
well the last episode was a little bit .. bad? beacuase it wastn what i spected
-_-
Well thats, like, your opinion, man
meleeman: die
Dark_Horst Awww man you missed a glorious steamroll on amerish we basically won everything and conquered :P
meleeman: Naw, wwt wunt bad,
/me licks Haku1013 :3
/me is licked
that was embarrassing
DashWithRainbows: ah k. which reminds me, i should probably get back to writing this incredibly redundant code. by the time i fulfilled all the requirememnts it was 5 times longer than it has to be :\
killerpony7733: next time i'll make time
00,10and then they declared a falt with the server cause clearly something is wrong when NC wins
AdamTheDuck no longer has to type [SWAG] but now has to type 1013
Dark_Horst Well if we are gonna conquer most times around midnight or so EU time and all i'm definitely gonna be around
sumica: NC? Nostaliga Critic?
killerpony7733: if some of the planetside-less sods in here would just download it, we could procure a small army
Hmm
well i didnt say sooo bad is just not like one of the best episodes of all the fim series
00,10eww no
My stream keeps dying
Nope, I can just type haku - then press tab to automatically complete it. :P
Well, you best get cracking on that work then, twilight_sprinkle.
DashWithRainbows: kk, ttyl then :P
imma just be afk
meleeman: ahem, eet wunt bad. I apolagise fer mah imprawpeh grammerz
still be spyin on yall tho
Dark_Horst 5 of us managed to hold of several aircraft and advancing tanks and sundy's at the VS warpgate till our main force came out of nowhere and smacked the hell out of the VS
this looks familiar...
J_E_Smith71: the New Conglomerate
dun dun duuuuuuuuun
Dark_Horst Imagine if we had the whole outfit online at that time
SAILOR MOOOOOOOOOOOON
00,10wrong magic girl
killerpony7733: now imagine what 15 would do. BWAHAHAHAHAHA
Nevermind - I was thinking Card Captors for second :)
00,10this one knows how to fight
Dark_Horst Eeyup
What ever happened to Anime Monday?
Didnt we use to have those?
just hope my sc issue gets resolved soon
Haku1013: There's anime running right now:p
00,10it died when Scifi became scfy
killerpony7733: You thief! You must pay for grabbing my intrest like that! I will accept your fine in the form of information as to the game of which you speak.
need thsoe damn rocket pods for the reaver
Yes, I know
DoctoDoctorWho: sorry doc but is a little bit difficult when you speak over 4 lenguajes at the same time
Oh wait
it's nto even half the plane without it
You were talking about SciFi not here
Sailor Moon was the first Magical Girl Warrior.
hmm hmm
She-Ra was
Nonsense, Sumica. Syfy is AWESOME.
00,10hey killerpony7733 so was the IR scope working ok for yah on the rocket?
There is no better channel for some of the stupidest and most hilarious movies ever made.
00,10or you think zoom would be better?
DoctoDoctorWho: planetside 2 my good sir
sumica Ummm not sure didn't try
/me is tired
/me thinks he should go to bread
meleeman: I do apologize, what I ment to say was that the previous episode was, infact rather good. Opinions speaking, of course.
/me soon
Greetings DoctoDoctorWho. When did you arive?
DoctoDoctorWho It's free to play on steam and on their site
00,10you forgot the ™
Haku1013, go to bread
NO< YOU CANT MAKE ME
Dovah: I never leave, I may not be here, but I never leave.
YOURE NOT MY REAL MOM
sumica But for the main cannon i am liking the IR since with a HE cannon you are gonna be close to smack the living crap out of the infantry
Haku never leaves also
Haku shall forever be in your hearts
Sugar and Cream in Hot Water? Okay...
plotting for your enivitable heart attack
sumica But i'm really on the fence about the missile launcher if it needs IR or zoom
00,10yeah and the HE dose well on armor too
DoctoDoctorWho: is good to know that more people than me enjoy that episode than me
the ony thing i know for certain i want are the rocket pods. everything else.... no idea. couldnt make up my mind in beta, cant now xD
fuu sorry
hey guys
hey new person
but what wrek'S been telling about the scout rifle sounds interesting
im not new
you probably just havent seen me
BY THE POWER OF GRAY SKULL
00,10so have no tryed it
is the anyone here who remembers me?
eenope
of* (lag is annoying)
Sorry
yay
~yay~
killerpony7733: Thank you sir, I shall indeed put interest toward this. What say your opinion of the game in comparison to the Command & Conquer series?
sumica Else i generally don't do much infiltrator unless i wanna hack
hmm?
00,10I might start investing in my heavy assault
DoctoDoctorWho What? you do realise the game i'm talking about is a MMOFPS?
Dovah: Opinions of the previous episode, "One bad apple"
00,10or max
sumica I may not have much cert invested to my classes yet but i have a ton of gear for them though due to my ummm SC >.>
DoctoDoctorWho: ah
i thought the last ep was awesome, had an important message that was well-delivered as well
yay
jbh1145, I know that screamer
screamers huh
jbh1145, stop it
sry
twilight_sprinkle well thats a good point of view
killerpony7733: I apologize, from context it sounded much like you were refering to an RTS style game, at which I excell, and will proceed to kick Dovah's ass at once the oppertunity presents itself.
twilight_sprinkle: Yeah One Bad Apple did have some mixed reviews. Some thought it was fun, some poeple thought that the moral wasn't handled good enough, etc
J_E_Smith71, I thought it was cute
like out of this world cute
Same here
illegaly cute
00,10CMC ep with song, it's a plus in my book
DoctoDoctorWho Ah but yeah the game that me sumi wrek and over 10 other bronystaters play is a MMOFPS game that is just huge.
Let me guess, car bomb?
cool kill someone cute
Song was pretty dang catchy
DoctoDoctorWho, now how do you prepose to do that when you do not even OWN the game?
I thought it was rather boring but had a nice song
and really
http://i.imgur.com/pK7xN.gif
I knew they wouldn't go hard in the paint in tackling bullying.
J_E_Smith71: idk, i felt the moral was handled pretty well, altho it might have been a bit more clearer expressed in the end i supposed, by the main idea was delivered well enough imo
jbh1145: so should i ignore you or you wont link screamers again?
i wont
Dovah: As said, once the oppertunity presents itself.
does anyone remember me? i was on here before
jbh1145 Your name seems familiar but that's it
oh well im pretty new here
nyeh
J_E_Smith71: *clearly, and *but, not by. i derped up that message >.<
jbh1145: When were you on here? Honestly, I might
oh lawdy
i think that in probably the next season we will see again babs seed .. maybe not ,who really know
like durning all the season 3 episode premieres and the last brony movie night on friday
Take note, wireless connection sucks ass
twilight_sprinkle: If stream weren't on I'd link a forum talkback with how well the ep handled bullying is a major discussion point
jbh1145: Oh, then sorry... I was never here when you were. I guess Im thinking of someone else
So, if anyone was thinking this was still going to be about one Jewel Seed at a time... nnnope
sailor moon?
Back
oh, nvm
pony_6133, Lyrical Nanoha
ahh..... wuts that?
Better Sailor Moon
J_E_Smith71: link it in pm plz, altho ill read it somewhat later

Evidently, they granted the wishes of mindless plankton who wanted to RAEG
sonicdude558: :) this might be one of those "you had to be there moments" but - my 8th grade history teacher was Mr. Noe - during a field trip...I think to a Civil War battle re-enactment, he disapeared and someone sang aloud "Where is Noe, Where is Noe? Nobody knows, Nobody knows" :P

cmllm
sumica, you really should sleep better.
ohai cachi01|kindamad, whats wrong?
00,10yeah I should

thelonepony: HAIRCUT

ewww a SuperBrony64
:>
yes yo you stay here like your life depent of it
hiyo SuperBrony64 ! <(~^_^~)/
I forgot my sound was on max. owwwwww
cachi01|kindamad: but its better than having long hair like i have at,
So I was thinking the other day...
I sleep too much, and I'm not active enough. And I also wake up in the middle of the night with either a shortness of breath or gerd, so my sleep schedule is a mess.
atm*
11,02I remember how I was so exhausted this one time, that I kept the video of Scootaloo G3.6 riding on her scooter for over 40 minutes on stream...before I woke up and stopped it.
That's a first then, Haku1013 :P
thelonepony: but i loved mah long hair D:
and that'S why we need to cut the earth in half
And I realized that the film industry is going to be doing really well for the next few years
cachi01|kindamad: just had a haircut, i know that feel, bro.
11,02Should do that again sometime soon.
SuperBrony64: :D
lel, I remember that one SuperBrony64
would eliminat e pesky timezones
sumica: lul ikr, tough for night people to live in the worlds day-focused schedule
11,02...soon o-o
SuperBrony64: o,o
ebrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrb
and our solar system would be the only one with a giant pair of boobs
SuperBrony64 This is why I tell you to go to bed

Also
11,02DashWithRainbows: But...all mah bestest of friends are up ;^;
cachi01|kindamad: I love long hair as much as you do, but do you want grease to build up on your hair?
you guys should stream deathnote sometime
one of the few animes i actually liked
thelonepony: as long as i have long hair
Considering there's the new Marvel movies coming out, the Justice League movies, the new Godzilla series starting up, and the new Star Wars Trilogy.
pony_6133 i agree
sumica: but yeah you should sleep if you feel the need, especially if you often dont sleep enough
thelonepony: plus it already did :I
00,10I remember this one time on stream where you went afk for 40 min and had noting but a still image streaming
00,10wait that was this morning
ah
lol
BURN
SuperBrony64 Well, it's their fault for being your bestest of friends then.
Haku1013: Dear Celestia, the year of the reboot.
sumica: oi, what is this?
Yeah sumica you should try resting better on Fridays, instead of running the stream non-stop all night till the new ep and take a sleep break
You all should rest then :I
...
or just schedule a loooong playlist
I remember when Wrek had something running for 2 hours, and was asleep for the entire rest of the day with a dead stream.
Are y'all tryin' to say Ah need to rest, oni_link?
sleep you need to
oni_link: rest is for the week
weak*
00,10whip that 9yr old third grader
11,02DashWithRainbows: yeah!
even for snorlax
ecchi ftw
and that'S how japan was made
DashWithRainbows: Not you specifically but some of you sound like you really should rest
Haku1013: they are rebooting godzilla?
wut
Yes
again?
I just never done it on Skype calls because I don't want you guys to remember my voice.
DashWithRainbows: i was just wondering cause then i would suggest spicy food to clear it right up
wait what? another Godzilla reboot?
DashWithRainbows: why not?
sumica: Then you'd be awake enough to run both Pet Shop and Aquabats (Though Aquabats seem to be in reruns)
Haku1013: yeah.....good luck with that
Its coming out in 2014
Dark_Horst Same reason why I don't let people see images of me, I'm very... What's the word...
LPS is meh
um its vinyl_scratch channel open for some request?
nope
Timid?
/me facepalms really hard, he JUST got DashWithRainbows' reference
Haku1013: not much to ask, and not to be rude at all, but can you please refrain from using the "h" in chrono? it just bothers me, crono just seems cooler to me.
DashWithRainbows: paranoid B)
00,10yeah with the embed changes I probably will have to sleep more
Reference?
DashWithRainbows: heh i kno dat feel
00,10cant relay on ninja any more
hmm hmm
I made a reference?
I for one look forward to the new Godzilla film
11,02Can I come and read you a bed time story sumica?
Ah, that's the word, Sith.
I betchya Im more paranoid!
@sumica you need to sleep over 8 hours all the day they said
I, for one, welcome our new giant building eater lazer shooter overlords
hm?
DashWithRainbows: I think that was an AJ line from when she was applebucking all by herself. Maybe not though
I didn't think much of Pet Shop but having on with the chat last Saturday was sort of fun
Theonly difference from the Japanese films is that Godzilla is going to CGI, but this time he'll have his actual, original design
00,10people say alot of things

Kandarihu: Her name is Lyra:p
Then, a new overlord stepped forth. And with his charisma and common sense, he quickly became master of the fictional world and killed all who opposed him. The end.

Oh Nanoha the show that teaches you the best way to make friends is to blast them with a beam that can level a city block.

You're implying I'm willing to steal a cactus, Joomay.

I need a bigger hard drive
Placebo, originally yeah, current system was made by Shizuka though
the refresh is like 3 lines, two of those are the function definition
question of the day :is luna still raising the moon ?,or his sister "troll-celestia" is raising the moon and the sun too yet?
nyeh
Ah. On irc. No clue what the site looks like
Shizuka, oh neat, its public now?

That's nuts. I didn't see it on the Steam sale list. Hrm.
spent too much money already :I I got gmod+CS:S, Cave Story, Audiosurf and the Basement Collection :|
I believe it is not stuttering now
'Too much money' AHAHAHA
Please
Joomay spent loads
oh look
Oh, it's because it's not a highlighted sale. Darn you, Steam, stop making me spend money
now it is stuttering, but its both the audio and video
it's Skylanders aka THE BIGGEST MONEY GRAB EVER!
sonicdude558 must be your end then.
11,02otakon's favorite game!
Oh, is this on your Wii U? :D
Jmo: In between jobs atm :|
Or as it should be called, the Wii U Mad?
Uh-huh
srs
SuperBrony64: well it IS! it's over 200 dollars to complete the collection of figures
lol he chubby
SuperBrony64: otakon's favorite game? the shipping game? :)
JK JK JK
Because let's be honest, it'd be way more awesome if it was called "Wii U Mad?" :|
SuperBrony64: WHY YOU NO ZOMBIE U?
lol
11,02otakon: Cause I spent my money on this game...
dat NiGHTS
your mom spent money on this game
11,02Crud, missed the NiGHTS message D:
I wish I had a wii u :(
Oh, it's made by Activision? That explains a lot
pony_3290: me too :(
oh Vicarious Visions made this?
thelonepony: me three
they made Xmen Legends too
only for the ZombieU ;~;
I would've gotten a Wii U, but I wanted a TV more
Hey everone :)
thats on the list
allo RainbowPie
SuperBrony64: dude THAT IS WHAT THIS REMINDS ME OF NOW!
Hi RainbowPie
hello RainbowPie
hiya RainbowPie
SUPER TOY PLANET :o
so much lag tough
Rainbow... pie
It's like a toy planet that's....super
the stream is really REALLY jerky
For some reason I can't view the live stream
Wait wait wait. The Wii u is out?
otakon, your stream is always jerky
evil
rainbow pie sounds ...
EVIL!
Its good for me
what if i told you that twilight in the future will be on the dark sideO.o?
Placebo: yup
dat voice acting
But yes, mine is too. :D
Ryunosuke: a shipping name
....
RainbowPie: Try pushing play
mmhmm
gameception
Spyro?
;~;
lol talk about Meta
Why is Spyro in there?
thelonepony: I know that but it still sounds like it should be a thing, like Apple pie, or Cerry pie....
it's a game about action figures with action figures
CriticKitten because reasons
Spyro is there?
J_E_Smith71: Its not that, It says "Loading the Justin.tv player in a fram is not allowed." Is it just be getting this?
frame*
this is really meta
Because he is ZIIIIIIIM
you know what, screw it, anything shipped with pie sounds food related
oh no the stutter
Ryunosuke: now that you mention it...
http://sphotos-f.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/154374_519699284709370_174698488_n.jpg
CriticKitten: because money, rebranding and merchandising
....Yoda?
sonicdude558: I knew it wasn't just me
What the actual fuck is going on
Bed time. Night
cachi01: XD
CriticKitten: they basically are toys in our world
RainbowPie: Then you have to just click the link on the screen and watch it there and pop this chat out
nighty night Placebo
Night Placebo
No, that's a plastic platform that glows
Not a portal
Pt in the morning
Ah, Twitch has autoplay.
SILENCE, GIR
well this won't end badly
yeah see it didn't end badly
Placebo: take care and knock out them pushups
.....Thor?
Hooah
looks more Odin
GRETTINGS GAAAAAAA@k master
of wonder and lag
....you mean Pandora?
/me salutes Placebo
Because that looks like Pandora
Is this Skylanders Giants?
XD i always do this http://sphotos-h.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/575275_441433832579764_1244992047_n.jpg
I guess so
Enlisted, bro. Thanks anyway
otakon: Can't be Odin, he's not asleep and useless
CriticKitten: he doesn't sleep all the time
GET THE WHALE!
dem graphics
cachi01: Me too, but without the game ;~;
Only whenever it's convenient
USE THE WHALE!
11,02...the Decepticons :P
Placebo: ah well, makes more sense. Either way do good and never quit!
An evil empire?
Never heard of that story plot before
SuperBrony64: any chance you can lower the stream quality bc it is REALLY stuttery
remember, Empire = Evil, Kingdom = Good
even putting twitch on low doesn't help
Also I was really hoping the villain would be Makuta
works fine here
you'd think there would be a good empire, but nope
CriticKitten: needs a crash bandicoot crossover
no stutter here
lol time to lose time
Bit stutter here and there but good at my end
ha this is a cool concept imo
god those puns
it is
MASH THAT X!
....it complimented you for that? Really? XD WELL DONE, YOU KNOW HOW TO PUT THINGS IN PLACES.
lol the graphics are good to
There we go
CriticKitten: remember GAME FOR KIDS
yep otakon it looks nice
Good, kill those goats, Portalmaster
Larson just said the best thing from his interview with Dustykat
ATTACK ALL OF THE GOATS!
about Background Ponies
whoa dat mario party sound effect
CrystalPhoenix: they are all awesome
otakon, are you watching the interview?
CrystalPhoenix interesting
chicken!
story of te blanks
CrystalPhoenix: um no
what did he say?
Interview?
I don't know
Hello everypony. Feels like it's been a while..
my stream keeps stuttering too much
hiya again Canadian_Brony
Hi Canadian_Brony :)
allo Canadian_Brony
hey Canadian_Brony!
Larson said, for background ponies, that the staff leave that field to us
further note
no BG ponies episode
they focus on the mane 6
dang
CrystalPhoenix: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
or as NC said: "Princess? You are the defacto Femaile Ruler, Queen it up bitch"
fandom fills in for BG Ponies
Oh and Canadian_Brony, You where right about BL2 :D
they really have to get a very GOOD reason to interact with the mane 6
Agreed with them. No need for BG pony eps. >_>
thelonepony ehh, I was?
lol dat one true pairing
Dat OTP
but yeah that's the best thing cause think of it that way
hmm this song seems very familar
do you want them to destroy your creativity field?
CrystalPhoenix well, makes more sense anyways, plus half the fun is making characters out of characters not in focus
Bingo Deacon
CrystalPhoenix: you mean like being brainwashed into guarding the exit to the cave where a certain princess and student are being held in order to prevent said plans from being messed up? :)
onoesmiiverseaaa
Ryunosuke, most likely those have been random pony #x in the script
they needed Ponies so they filled it with random ones
Ryunosuke more like "character development". They're letting us create who they are with nothing but a limited visual description.
dat reboot post
Canadian_Brony: ahh i see
unless the story boarders actually put some in intentionally
dat RD
sonicdude558: she ALWAYS dresses in style
like.... Lyra and "Anthropology"
your mom and dad dress in style
lol it's Hank
OH YEAH!
honk honk amazing honks
lol
Actually I'm boggling something kinda interesting for Vinyl-Scratch
now I want a WiiU
/me sonicdude558 always dresses in style
it might be my only and very own headcanon but still
/me slaps superretroworld in the face
whoa dat mario party sound effect
again
sonicdude558: hehe jk
oyeaaaaaa
sonicdude558 I've wanted a WiiU since it was showcased way back at E3. What I'm so shocked about is me wanting to get Black Ops II for it. I hate CoD!
Canadian_Brony: wow that IS surprising
Canadian_Brony: I hate CoD too but for some reason I always end up buying it
SuperBrony64: it's gonna be A WHILE before you can level Tree Rex up
god the music reminds me of Lego Universe
Dat1FuglyMuffin: same with tetris, i hate that game now, but i cant stop playing it
11,02otakon: How do you know?
SuperBrony64: read the guide
SuperBrony64: I only don't like this game bc it takes a real fortune to get all of the characters
You can interact with certain objects by PUNCHING THEM
Poor ass potato.
Eehehehe.
Fluttertree? :)
Jmo: dude you do realize it would take well over 200 bucks to get ALL of the figures right?
no Ryunosuke, otakon
And?
Jmo: just NOT including the damn games themselves
GÃK
well Flutterguytree? :)
No
...
otakon!

YOU NAMED HIM OTAKON!
BONE CHOMPY

again?
Looks about right, actually
lesson for life

That is definitely an otakon
otakon: what do you mean... again?
theyre dicks, and no one likes them
Dear Princess Celestia...
CriticKitten I thought it was an ota
>Gigantus
>not very big
HULK SMASH
well, this game looks really really fun
dat cuz
he's a pygmy giant
Canadian_Brony, Ryunosuke it happened before in Skyrim, he started a new character. Said the 6th poster will name him . I got kicked and spouted the usual "GODDAMMITDARIBOT!" and that was the charcacter name
A leg of lamb?
xD
hehe
mario party
hahahaha
otakon is streaming?
more like you see your ash
sonicdude558: right??? you hear it too?

Someone needs to explain all this color correction crap properly. How are they deciding what the correct colors are?
Phase4 you may need to download some software to put a working .gif as your desktop background, but I wouldn't doubt it
Bigcheese_: the color can only be use by the mods
well on windows yeah, on linux i can just paint over the root window
pfft
Linux
wait
thelonepotpony: which is why I have all of them on ignore. But that's totally unrelated to my question.

hmm, no software needed for Windows either
I'm totally doing that!

dammit, it's not animated
http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/13th0w/i_had_to_edit_everything_but_it_loops_so_help_me/ reddit post it was from
"Versions prior to Vista"
FFFUUUUUUU-
Using Firefox now...
Canadian_Brony, you can set gifs as the background but it wont animate them
I know Phase4, I just tried...
and it's not f*cking working!!!
Phase4, though I do believe they were animated in XP
Guys, I think you had to use Firefox to solve the issue.
or something earlier
"Animated gifs cannot be set as desktop background in Windows Vista or 7"
this computer runs 7
yeah
the other Vista
same here
fuck
VenHur: solve what issue?
my XP computer fried itself a few months ago
oh and same here

there's software you can get for Linux and OS X, but not for Windows

SuperBrony64 VenHur: Maybe it would have been better if they had a Kirby game in Nintendo Land: http://cdn.brawlinthefamily.keenspot.com/comics/2012-11-16-449-Nintendo%20Land.jpg
given that's more of Sega's fault
11,02CrystalPhoenix: Beat it :P ...though as for the game as a whole...it feels weird...it doesn't feel like the original anymore and for that reason I'm kind of put off by it :/
CrystalPhoenix, the BOOST CHALLENGE?
SuperBrony64: At least the track designs are good
I knew, as soon as I saw the notification that Shizu was playing Audiosurf, that she would be streaming.
Like the ones with NO CHECKPOINT

Yay
MahBoi777: YA LIMEY!
/me tosses crumpets at MahBoi777
So is this Audiosurfer thing hard to steer?
:D
nah only messing with you
MahBoi777: youre british?
I throw mah hooves up in the air sometimes
twilight_sprinkle: lolno :D
Sayin neeeighhhh-oohhh
MahBoi777: o ok, i was wondering if it was late at your place or not :P
/me cracks neck

twilight_sprinkle: u mean pony? :D
My sister just asked me if I've ever played WoW
MahBoi777: yus :D
Shizuka: thanks for the stream :)
AttackWithHugs that doesn't make sense as a joke. Why would this song make you horny?
twilight_sprinkle: Pinkie <3
I can't because this laptop is like 5 years old, has 2GB of RAM and probably can't handle it
you could actually
wow is about 8 years old at this point
:D
MahBoi777: k :P
and the tech hasn't improved all that much in it
Plus my USB port is broken so it won't work anymore
XP
your answer wasnt twilight though, so we cant be friends anymore
D:
/me Is reminded of the music from Bramble Blast
TT^TT
jk :D
/me nomz MahBoi777 :3
Hell it can't handle Minecraft on lowest settings without recieveing the wrath of the Lag Gods
/me ogles twilight_sprinkles plot
/me hugs twilight_sprinkle "O U"
Lovely:)
/me hugs :3
this song is so good
/me stays focused on the plot
Picture
Sorry.
Splash screen
either way, I'd advise against wow just on principle, it's not a healthy game
oh myyyyy~
and I speak from experience
im not done perfecting my plot~
...
,,,
Thanks for the lovely stream once again Shizuka. :)
twilight_sprinkle, you must perfect it, for your destiny is at stake
I checked in at the wrong time, didn't I?
stream is over?
Oh you actually are a girl, twilight_sprinkle? I was just guessing...
Whatever your destiny may be, I don't know.
you're assuming there's a right time
or now
Is she done? She never said she's done
13is a good song to end on
13do not really have any video left to show
How so?
ah
Oh, okay. Thanks for the stream, then.
Yes
AttackWithHugs: i shall do it! !.!7
Grazi
Thanks for the Audiosurf, Shizu!
thx for stream Shizuka
Grazi, amica mia.
thanks for the stream Shizuka
it encourages addiction in order to keep people playing, there's always that next thing to do/get
>WoW an addiction
I was a top end raider for about 3 years
>BronyState an addiction
Shizuka: wait does that mean we ran out of bill nye?
Which is healthier????
13eeyup
awwwww
Well that happened :P did i miss anything?
neither technically, but with wow it tricks you into thinking you're actually accomplishing something
Bill Nye :'(
I never saw any Bill Nye :'(
Wait what happened?
what about Bill?
Sniff
awwww
Chat froze
Ohh
Oh that's why I got kicked out somehow
What did Shizuka run through all the Bill Nye eps or something?
Welp, I won't be playing WoW for a bit. I needs moneys to buy it
I never saw any :'(
complaining about it won't get you any
trust me, at this point it's not worth playing either way
hey Canadian_Brony^^
hi MahBoi777
the game has gone downhill in the last 2-3 years
I wish I'd known about this site earlier.
I just found this like 3 weeks ago on EQD
Weeks?
Hm
twilight_sprinkle: What did Shizuka say before you posted? Chat froze and had to reload and I missed what you were saying earlier
J_E_Smith71: that we ran out of bill nye
http://tinyurl.com/5v9hsnm
Oh NOW I know why its called tinyurl!
Shizuka: Run a video of the Universe of Energy ride at Epcot that has Bill in it. That's one thing with him in that you haven't shown:p
also J_E_Smith71 top tip, if chat freezes you can still use it by using highlighting to scroll up and itll refresh
you can do that if you dont want to miss any conversation
Thanks LurkerBrony
that is just awesome LurkerBrony

Coffee is best breakfast
But breakfast steak is the most important steak of the day
I just thought about something to do I wanted to try - In Dishonored, in the Flooded district, there's a huge tanks of whale oil leaning over and leaking, creating a river of flamable whale oil that runs along a little track under a collapsed tunnel with a few apartments above...
Im going to be watching some MLP episodes but i'll be here in the chat ok
In the game, when you throw a filled up canister of whale oil, it explodes :)
where is jaymoo
He seems to be away aniderp

08,01MadSurge: i'm wonderful
Cellos are for yellow bellies.
jmo its ponies hour!
Real men blow ye the trumpet.
aniderp howso?
Who else thinks Dashie can be somewhat of a troll? XD
idk im on youtube listening to pony videos
like amv and whatnot that has mlp in
jmo my zelda cases and marceline case night come today!
would it be possible to put 6 of the 7 deadly sins to the mane cast?
/me squees
08,01MadSurge: i've not actually seen it yet
Very nice aniderp :)
3 cases like 30 something dollar
08,01i was here on saturday, but i was busydoing tech stuff
so no more cases ordering for me..
noice :P
even though i might want a rd one ;_;
or derpy..
Aww
/me huggles aniderp
im not good with money...
Maybe another time aniderp
hello everypony :3
they come from china..
Ohai SkunkTari!
you know what?
im gonna wrap the package up.. and open it on chirtsmas :>
o.o
AdamTheDuck: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/sample/8c07f0c011e796ac7578f467398143e3.jpg And now, crystallized!
o.o
I'll wrap you up aniderp :P
why me? D:
/me holds on tightly to crystallised Octavia
Cause I can~
do i get tinsel?
yush.
and shiny thingys
gallium looks fun
o.o
i get distracted easily..
seriously would I be dead if I consider Vinyl Scratch to be a muted pony?
i hate icecream earlier
had*
i dont hate it D:
http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/315JiSYIqWL._SL500_AA300_.jpg
CrystalPhoenix: Pinkie : Gluttony , RD : Pride/Sloth , Rarity :Greed , Fire-Twilight : Wrath , Trixie : Envy , cant really place Lust atm , probably Molestia but cant seem to fit it into the mane 6
08,01gallium! \o/
how come the limeV doesnt work for me?
08,01i love gallium!
not broadcasting atm
SkunkTari: it hates europeans apparently
:3 http://fav.me/d5288zv
TrixieMuffin, I hought Applejack could be Wrath
/me jumps all around the chat hyperly
/me glues aniderp to the floor :3
hmm $26 for 15 grams of gallium
and Envy maybe Fluttershy
.....maybe
but double rainbow syndrom on
AdamTheDuck: classy and fabulous~
CrystalPhoenix: if any id put her on Pride
/me slaps AdamTheDuck around a bit with a large trout
Bad Adam.
yeah I considered that too
/me duct tapes Jmo's hands together
im stuck to the floor ;_;
then again fluttershy can be wrath
since at the given circumstances she can be deadly
and that would leave Twilight with Envy
So Pinkie=Gluttony, Rainbow=Sloth, Rarity=Avarice, Fluttershy=Wrath, Twilight=Envy, Applejack=Pride, Celestia=Lust?
How the hell is queen horse lust?
Buytoast, either that or leaving Lust empty
You people mixing canon with fanon again?
eyup
unless you have a better suggestion
im still glued to the floor..
Here's one.
Nothing.
then nothing it is for Lust
Cadence ?
/me cuts the floor around aniderp so she can move
lawl maybe
Problem solved :3
-hops around-
Although I guess Buzz Buzz the Flying Love Bug would probably fit well enough.
That too
then again I kinda wanted the good guys to fit in the deadly sins
Miss Smartypants with wnat it need it spell
/me pokes chat with a stick
Its dead Jim!
is the stream on?
oh, just the buffer show.
Have some Dashie trolling Twi, then

I don't really enjoy the fact that "trolling" replaced a bunch of words
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaMWxLCGY0U
what word are you looking for, CrystalPhoenix ?
Hi guys. :)
gunny, what do you mean
I just hate how "trolling" is now part of the general english vocabulary
CrystalPhoenix: about trolling
what of it?
it's a stupid word
They see me trolling, they hatin'.
I always thought swag was a stupid word too crystalphoenix.
:P
like what happened to joking
swag is another horrible word
it is. XD
Yolo as well.
What is becoming of this world.....
yep
first epic
swog4lyf
then trolling
i have never heard of the word yolo until now
XP
now yolo or swag or anything the teenagers say these days
Yolo is said a lot here.
it is. :P
You obviously love Octavia :3
It's ironic when people playing video games say yolo.
CrystalPhoenix: Ah. The days of "Epic win/epic fail/etc" on the Internet...
"You only live once" as they are playing video games.
inb4 everypony is trolling
but yeah trolling.....why can't it be joking or harassing
or any words involving a person making fun of another
Where did the word trolling come from is my question. x3
what happened to those words?
OH WAIT
Everypony forgot about them and replace Trolling
nvm
So, let me ask a question. How many people swear here? :3
replace them with trolling**
Cause back in the day, swearing like, never occurred, and when you did swear.
because its the internet CrystalPhoenix
You were frowned upon.
gunny, not only the internet
08,01i love squeakybelle
Now it's everyday language,
08,01best VA
we hear trolling everywhere now
outside and everything
XD
sweetiebot
trolling is the new norm it seems
Just to check, nothing is being streamed right now, right?
yes and I do not like it
trolling is dumb and irratating
i sprayed axe in my mouth
x///x
lol
The reason it's called trolling, is because the English verb "Troll" means 'to slowly drag a lure'.
I always thought axe smelled like bug spray a lot.
XAX what?
pronounced "trawl" I think.
isn't Troll a fantasy creature?
your definition is from the internet buddy
dont they live under bridges?
4chan to be precise
tf2 is full of mic spammers and trolls
XD
But what trolling used to be was, as the English definition means, slowly dragging a lure and them the person finally realizing they're being trolled.
'I sprayed axe in my mouth' Do you have a brain of a peanut
now, most people just think of "EPIC TROLL XD"
k, you guys should be getting stream
when 3 people are spamming over each other with saxton and other crap, major ear rape
Jmo: He's just trolling XXXXXXXXXDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Don't ever, do that again.
you guys getting stream?
That face is the most retarded face ever.
Phase4: no because I'm in he'd
BED
IM IN BED
Jmo: yes sir
i got stream now
HE'D, THE NEW BED
XAX while I do see your point of the original internet meaning of troll you're missing an important point to put it outside of the internet
Good kiwi.
and phase quitted
with a quick search I see now that troll is actually a FISHING verb

Phase4 i ment earlier today
00,02oh, yeah

Phase4, wasn't it pouring down for you? .-.
00,02not really storms
00,02bunch of rain though
Yeah that seems about right
i got lots of thunder
Being outside when the rain hit sucked >.>
where do you live JRP
So heh this has been insightfull
the moon
its gonna snow today D:
shall i wear boots or not yet?
Kerbals! \:3/
now I can joke around with the "trolling" expression now that I know its origin and true meaning
What type of boots aniderp? o_O
just imagine me going to work when it decides not to snow and me wearing snow boots
that most people seem to forgot
Ah snow boots.
00,02wow
00,02eve has a lot of atmosphere
i know where my snow boots are!
Nice song. o3o
Phase4 try out the gamecube emulator
Hm... trying to remember original song name.
00,02JRP2234, dolphin?
i wanna read a creepypasta.. :\
00,02used it before, works quite well
yesh
00,02cbf setting it up
it plays gamecube very very well
00,02stupid broken volume control
to 5 years ago where it was bugging as shit
00,02well it became open source a few years ago
00,02sence then development went much faster
are they still updating it?
00,02yeah
00,02probably being worked on RIGHT NOW
i have a better emulator
its called a gamecube
00,02they hide it somewhere
00,02the svn repo
00,02aparently i need to enroll to vote
00,02there it is
hm
00,02http://code.google.com/p/dolphin-emu/
fun fact all gamecubes can do 3d
00,02seems tf2 has seized up
jaymoo
00,02JRP2234, last change was 6 hours ago
wow
Phase4 what game did you try?
yes aniderp?
00,02cant remember
bring me to starbucks?
00,02interesting tech in dolphin
Sounds like a plan :>
then i buy mocha frappucino for me!
its a wii emulator also
mocha frappucino for two it shall be.
you like them too?
Never tasted one :P
what map is that phase
00,02SkunkTari, surf_greatriver
why would you use dolphin when our glorious nintendo overlord generously let us play gamecube games on our Nintendo Wii systems
00,02remarkably mooring map
00,02Buytoast, thats why i stopped using dolphin
00,02i got a wii
Phase4 can you look into any nintendo 64 emulators that the dev is still active
00,02plus it never worked on my old machines
00,02JRP2234, not many
i think Project 64 is ded
00,02i forget what its called but there is one in development now
00,02project 64 is long dead
Uhh, feeling a little sick again, might head off to sleep early again
you think gamecube games will work on wii u?
but its still very good
Goodnight everyone.
00,02and no one though to release the source code
i used to have 64 but couldnt get it to work wel
mupen 64?
00,02^ i think thats in
00,02it'
aniderp, Gamecube games won't work on the Wii U
"mugen" or "mupen"
but reg wii games will?
Yep
that's why you need to play them on your Wii
yus
why not gamecube games? D:
Phase4 WHY DID NINTENDO PUT A RESISTIVE TOUCHSCREEN ON THE WII U
New drive hardware that won't read Gamecube games.
oh
00,02ptrwager, mupen
08,01so i just watched the new episode
00,02i remember it starting with m and it had 64 in the name
HALLO
08,01my god, newfilly is cute!
08,01and squeakybelle is still adorable
she should have suffered
08,01i really enjoyed that episode
08,01i was worried that it was going to be uber crap and preachy
http://i.imgur.com/iyciy.gif seriously
08,01but it was really entertaining
it lacked comeuppance man
08,01didn't like the song
guys...
00,02stupid mouse is seizing
i have to shop on staurday ;_;
the headbob
that orange monster needed some humiliation
the cutest thing I've seen
meaning.. i will miss the episode
so?
Babs seed is her name
i sleep in during the episodes all the time
not a big deal
but
then i have to go on youtube or somethign when i get home
00,02i'm usually better than this
00,02at surfing
aniderp, on the bright you'll see it in glorious 1080p
on the bright side**
or this place streams after movies right?
That's correct aniderp
or yeah you could catch the rerun of the episode after EBMN
i can watch after movie night :>
after the movies
08,01i was too busy until now

Shitting Bookshelves

Buytoast, yeah I'm starting to consider watch new eps later
i'm just not going to bother staying up anymore
00,02need to pull a hell of a turn there
00,02need to figure how to use mice on laptops
08,01aniderp: depends on how hard you hit it
wish i could get tf2 to work my my cpu
00,02almost
08,01i wish i could stop watching Misfits and actually do some work
00,02work?
00,02whats that?
that's that british thing with the people and the thing right?
lol when the newcomers flipped about seaponies xD
00,02is it a new way to watch pony?
00,02aniderp, ikr
Spoiler: there are none
we love sea ponies <3
seaponies?!?!?!?!?!
wut
seaponies~ <3
SEAPONIES
i liek seaponies they are cool
every time my little dashie is played i need to be held :<
ah, Sir Dragonbanger's Chamber of Horse-Filled Perversion is as up to date as always
EQD is late
.....again
now i feel even worse that ive hardly seen much of the show
aniderp: i always cry to my little dashie
00,02i'm bored with this map
SkunkTari, go read Background Pony
its sad :<
liek dis if u cri evry tiem
My Little Dashie is nothing
it's true
her crying at the end :<
00,02my little dashis is that verry blunt kind of sad
or even the End of Ponies
even though I haven't read it yet
08,01"knock knock, who's there? it's my cock" <-- misfits. so classy.
:'( stop talking bout little dashie
but it look like sob material
you mean Word Word word: The Fan Fiction?
well Buytoast isn't a fanfic filled with words?
well yeah
but that end of horses thing
stream window keeps buffering for me :S
08,01i love horses
that's something that makes a dictionary say damn
08,01they're so large and lovely
08,01they're like GIANT DOGS
I enjoyed Background Pony even though it's pretty wordy
i need to watch MLP:FiM from the start anypony know a good download site?
you know what
mld is better
i'm going to write a story
ptrwager, Youtube
and it'll be sadder
badder
and better than anything else
Buytoast, that would be neat
and no SkunkTari MLD is horrible
i loved the dashie story
08,01MLD is not very well written
there are WAY BETTER and even sadder fan fiction than that......joke
08,01hey ptrwager
???
maybe i can convince it to get on Sir Dragontickler's Warsol of Peevish Equines
08,01ptrwager: youtube has all the episodes
hell, i already got some garbage on there before
08,01Buytoast: hahaha
08,01<3
i hate my router
im gonna say it that my little dashie is the best fic i have ever read
:'(
and its not badly written
:| I hate Vista SO MUCH :[
shit, warsol isn't even a word
Cupcake song + dubstep/techno music in background = awesome. x3
Pinkie pie sounds good autotuned.
08,01SkunkTari: heh, you've not read many fics then
that sounds like some rejected Shel Silverstein book
i have read the Vegabond one too
00,02eating my gun
"Cupcakes and Other Fan Fics: Tales from the Abyss and Somehow Further Down"
08,01SkunkTari: yeah, cupcakes ain't all that good either
i have read at least 5 and more fan fics
my top fan fic is MLD
it has to be good!
6_9
08,01romance reports is a fantastic (NSFW) fanfic
08,01Macintosh is brilliant too (SFW)
08,01Fallout: Equestria
08,01SkunkTari: i did
mld and cupcakes
08,01i've read tons of fanfics
MAYO/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
hell, i used to read fan fics too
until they started become self insert oc fantasies
well
more often
yea then it just gets creepy
and SkunkTari here's why MLD is horrible http://onemansponyramblings.blogspot.ca/2012/07/6-star-reviews-part-85-my-little-dashie.html
08,01CrystalPhoenix: I did, aye
good song
Not gonna click that link because its their opinion
SkunkTari, it's an analysis
08,01i've read most of it
08,01i do like Lyra stories
back
CrystalPhoenix: still an opinion
and i fell on my floor ;_;
Welcome back aniderp
08,01i read this NSFW one about ehr and a human
how .-.
well..
08,01it was quite well written
i lost balance
08,01oh! read Celestia's Teeth!
08,01it's hilarious!
Soilder must go, his people need him
and what have you thought of Background Pony so far beside the fact tht it's Lyra?
if its so badlt written, then why are people crying when they finish the story
*badly
SkunkTari, because it got popular for one concept only
owning a pony
because people will cry at anything that'll go for a cheap cry
which is a fantasy for most bronies
XP really?
owning a pony?
08,01SkunkTari: because people have no taste
that too
and what would that be hmm
hmmmmmm
http://i.imgur.com/sGCe4.jpg
what kind of taste dont they have?
08,011) people have bad taste, 2) people have a fantasy of owning a pony/having a daughter
i could write a shitty story that ends with something sad
and get people to cry
does that make it good?
maybe
are you le serious?
/me 08,01wants a daughter
I wouldn't mind having a kid and tell that kid my philosophic rambles
Ha ha ha.
i personally think it was very well written and had a very good backstory
i dont want any kids
spending my life with 5 siblings has demonized children for me
08,01RawketLawnchair: i wouldn't mind Babs Seed as a daughter
SkunkTari, WHAT BACKSTORY
BACKSTORY?
08,01i'd train her up to have a scottish accent
It had no backstory whatsoever
IN CRY LITTLE DASHIE?
we don't even know the guy at all
he was nothing, noone
he was bland
oh man, you made me bust a gut there
im not gonna talk anymore about it since you guys are being assholes about it now
which actually is a cheap way to sink the reader in
so what the fk ever ok
easier to connect it with yourself if the protagonist has no character
08,01MadSurge: she was adorable
Exactly Buytoast
00,02what the heck happened to voice chat
MLD is also filled with plot-holes
08,01she was okay by the end of it
this is audio from that one video
IS THIS THOSE FLIM FLAM DRUNK SINGERS?
where the drunk guy sings the flom flem song, aint it?
Stop talking about MLD already since its SO BAD
wha wha whaaaaaa
That couch ain't goin' no where.
08,01 i just want to say
waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
keep crying baby!
:[
XD
08,01Misfits this season is *really* 18+

There there aniderp.
hurp a durp?
08,01sppoilers?
08,01where?
Oi, Jaymo, what are you doing?
What do you want?
but serious talk SkunkTari and that's my final word on this. There are WAY more fanfiction out there that are better written than MLD
i lost balance.. thats how
08,01^
08,01there's some really really good fanfics out there
You may enjoy MLD if you want sure but seriously don't put it at the top of your list
MLD is just 'm-muh feels ;_;
CrystalPhoenix: i dont fking care anymore ok
it really doesn't deserve the attention it has
ugh
What
oh boy
is the big deal with my little dashie?
Could easily replace Dash with any pone and it'd be the same story.
and those were my final words, if you won't mind I have to take a shower
^
just over rated
i said i dont wanna talk about it
y couch???

The spy
That made me laugh so hard the first time I saw it on an episode stream. xD
Pokecolt: This Spy Aria? :D

I think that's Vinyl he's drawing, IIRC.
Infected Mushroom, like your style :)
There should be a costumizable way to say whether someone enters the channell
ohai Scoots. Didn't see you there. :D
Ohai Scoot-Scootaloo
like "Scoot-Scootaloo has entered the battlefield"
AJIsAwesome: I have some stream issues, so Wrek is drawing Vinyl?
Dark92Enigma: Yep! :)
And morning y'all~
Scoot-Scootaloo: like a thief in the night?
Scoot-Scootaloo: good morning!
/me places C4 around Scoot-Scootaloo
Damn C4 pro's...

Scoot-Scootaloo: That'd be pretty cool. Considering that you can customize your quit message, I think it could be possible.
Suddenly eyes
Anyway, no classes this morning! :D
AJIsAwesome: oh yeaaaahh!! tell me, does she have the BASS CANNON?
Lucky you Scoots! :D
Dark92Enigma: Not really, just Vinyl so far.

Hello weeping_pegasi82
AJIsAwesome: I'm watching every episode today, start of season 1 to current; huzzah for root canals! \ o /
hey AdamTheDuck
DarkColt: Hooray! Best of luck! :)
DarkColt, the Brony Challenge
I wish you luck my dear.
I'm up to the start of episode 37
The Brony Challenge + Brony Drinking Game = best way to die? :3
Oh gawrd xD
T^T I dunno if I want my ponysona to be a unicorn, or a pegasi pony
DarkColt: No earth? :<
^
Nope
Okay. :3
I love flying, and I love magic
In every game available, I've always played the mage/warlock/magic user
And with that, I always tend to gravitate towards flight/speed related spells, or like in Halo 4, use the Jetpack
Hmm, I've always went for the sneak, theif-like characters...
I've always been the assassin type too, but sometimes I go for brute strength
Usually with a tad of magic if I'm not playing saneak.
da magics!
Has The Wizard ever been shown here?
'dat pew pew
AJIsAwesome, according to http://www.bronystate.net/about-us/past-movies/ nope
Thanks, AdamTheDuck. :)
broken glass?
Hmm so broken Vinyl goggles
After I watch ponies, I have to figure out if I should play Halo 4, or Dungeon defenders.
crystal vinyl is best pony
Actually, I probably need need to play Halo 4
Be a bass and play both at the same time :P
New Spartan Ops Episodes :P
AdamTheDuck: Homahgurd, genious!
boss*
NO! I will be a bass >:C
Darkcolt, did you play the halo's b4?
Just don't trop me? :C
Habubuman: I've beaten every HAlo game on Legendary.
ok me 2 but i have a qustion
Deducation :D
sry for my english D
ehh
Dedication*
do you think they have destroyed halo?
multiplayer that is
i think they have made it into cod mini :/
I did'nt play halo but a friend said the multiplayer looks like cod too.
i'll go
bb
bye Jake
Bye Jake
yea, they have kills streaks!! :[
Wat.
come on...
yea
Kill streaks in Halo 4?
orr
bye Jake
...
not exakely
when you have killed some people you get a bonus like a wepon or bost
inb4 Halo 5 is made in the next half year and added iron sights feature...
^^
-.-'
wow
..
really?
you are joking right
Killstreaks don't mean that I ain't MLG in it! >: D
Halo with iron sights... I would go jump off a cliff.
pls xD
(I'm not sure, i did'nt play), but it look like cod because of weapons (like cod, you are stonger with better weapons with lvl up)
well true but i miss when halo was it's own game and not coping some other gaes :/
Wait...
*game
Levels affect gameplay now?
Wat.
yea
I stopped at Halo 3, so excuse me ;~;
Nope, but a friend said lvl up = better weapons = ...
that is true to
i have played online and the more you play the better guns you get
soo
yea...
At this rate, I don't think I'm ever going to try another Halo...
yea but!
they need to make a battlefront 3
Although ODST was fun when I was over at a friend's.
the campain is actually good in my oppinion
^
weeping_pegasi82, ...
:$
but well master chif is not a emo anymore in the campain xD
You don't know how many times I've waited on news about that
*chef
or waht ever he is spelled xD
only to get it shut down for some apparent reason...
Chief I think
i dont really trust 343 industries :/
05halo has been a dissapointmentsince combat evolved
yea thats it ^^
too lazy to bother in this slow morning of mine
if they kept the thing that made battlefront 2 so good and just improved upon that without turning into star wars cod then I would be happy
yea! me to
Um hello

Votes for who is best pony happening now! Do not spam
oops
Im not leaving
:P
sorry
ChaosDuck: All ponies are best pony. :3
AJ is best
All 6mane are best pony
manes*
Âj i think but i like them all
*Aj
Twilight is best pony (and Chrysalis)(And Luna)
Luna is best princess
If you are voting only one pony
Applejack!
i like luna to but we hardly see her :/
Fluttershy :(
putting your hoff down! :D
*hoof
thx
my english is not that good :/
I like Twilight alot mainly because I act like her...alot
woo! reading!
Been playing Paper Mario Sticker Star alot lately
So far AJ has 2 votes, Luna has 2 votes, Fluttershy has 1 and Twilight also has 1
but we cant compare the mane 6, they are all good. :)
in my oppinion atleast
Derpy is best background pony :3
but we can compare background ponies
Well lets talk about the new episode.
OCTAVIA!!
AJ is best background pony
:D
When is Octavia going to show up?
any ponies are allowed in the vote
St-Timid: :D
St-Timid: eeexxxccuuuuuussse me?
ChaosDuck: New one or newest one?
SpadeMagnes[School]: Give her time..... :D
Im so curious who they're going to get to voice octavia
they should make an episode where its nothing but background ponies
no spoilers!
She better sound fancy
:I
Plz no spoilers
i mean there the main cahrs full with lines and everything
I'm trying to stay spoiler free for the rest of the season
05no talk about unaired S3 episodes
05talkign about them is a ban
Kay
I failed miserably for the first two episodes
We're not spoiling.
but can we talk about the episodes that are allready out?
Yes
i thought so ^^
Did Live have a issue? or are we using a new streaming thing for no reason?
SpadeMagnes[School]: mips was hijacked it's not secure anymore
Is bronystate fixed?
SpadeMagnes[School]: LiveV doesn't work for everyone.
Oh
ChaosDuck: It was the live stream that was hijacked, not bronystate.
Okay
I dont know about the rest of ya'll but I fucking love Sticker Star
Sticker Star is a terrible Paper Mario game
Screw you
i didn't say it was a bad game
Its better than Super Paper mario, even though I kind of found that fun....
well i am out, have a great time everypony! cya :)
i said it's a terrible Paper Mario game
Bye, Habubuman. :)
Buytoast: Its better than Super anyway
at least super had partners
and let you choose what to attack
Oh stop bitching about that
I loved the old paper mario, but sticker star have'nt the same gameplay ?
you don't get partners
I never used the partners that often anyway, I used one and that was it
you can't choose what to attack
boom im back
you have to rely on stickers to attack
i would like to exuse my spam
Its called experimenting..
OH COME ON!! dumb adobe crash
which means if you have no money or crappy stickers you won't win
i did....
You should have no excuse to not have stickers
bosses usually have some gimmick to beat them you wouldn't see unless you lose to them at least once
Or money
05so far so good
im currently using proxy
and.... i dont want too
woo hoo
but
my ip got banned from chat
you're using a proxy to avoid a ban?
You can run from any fight anyway
oh boy
OH BOY
could i please be unbanned? i was lol spamming :( im taking responebility and wanting to be unbanned v_v
you can run from a fight, that won't help when you can't advance in the game because you need a specific sticker
They arent that hard to find
Okay.
^
Oh.
I'm new to this.
they may not be hard to find, but that's a stupid way of extending the game
hell, thing stickers are terrible
<.<
Its called experimenting..good god
if they were something like the crystal star power meter thing then they'd be good
Every time some game tries something new they bitch
ChaosDuck: Make sure to read the Rules and FAQ while yoju're here. :)
When they dont try something new they bitch
but having to run around the map constantly trying to find one sticker to beat a guy is a pain in the ass
MAKE UP YOUR MIND
with paper mario they didn't need to change
but they did anyways and created bad shit
Who's going to get the new Farcry game!
but the third boss is nice
specially with how he attacks
I liked how the boss clapped to the music
that's what i'm talking about
Who's getting FarCry3?
that was good stuff
I'm back for 5 minutes........i've heard before left that MadSurge was in pain.......or it was SpadeMagnes[School]?
Me
but that fight was also shitty because the thing you need to actually stand a chance is so far off
oh
SpadeMagnes[School]: what happened?
Not sure if Mad was... didnt see what he said
SpadeMagnes[School]: what happened? D:
Is there a fight going on?
nope
Dark92Enigma: Had my toenails ripped out to get rid of a ingrown and an infection
I am fine
ChaosDuck: Nope. Discussion.
and you have to agree SpadeMagnes[School]
Kersti is useless
outside of that stupid spin gimmick
ChaosDuck: and games discussions
SpadeMagnes[School]: :O
Yea...not as interactive as Goombario/Goombella
SOMEONE ANSWER MY QUESTION
the help is nothing
no one is gertting far cry
its bad
SpadeMagnes[School]: and i thought it was just for walking too much.....
FarCry isn't bad.
far cry.....hu, no
ChaosDuck: but we did answer!
It's quite good.
ok, brb after lunch.......get well SpadeMagnes[School]
honestly, if they had made the thing stickers just some sort of meter thing rather than have you have to go and either buy em or track em down again i'd be fine with it all
gak gak
no
Again you have no excuse to not have stickers, they're everywhere
i'm not talking about the shit little stickers
i'm talking about the 3d item ones
Twitchy-twitcha, twitcha-twitch:O
How do you reply to someone?
I never used those that often in battle except for bosses
That's sad. A fellow Tennessean coming on, just to spam that which must not be named
that's what i mean
you need specific ones to fight the bosses or interact with certain things
You only need like 1 or two per boss
but I shouldn't need to purposely lose a fight just to figure out how to be something
ChaosDuck: type there name, you can use tab for autocomplete
nor have to run away
The game could at least drop a hint to be fair...
granted i do like the whole, this sticker works on this guy thing
but yeah, hints are sorta lacking there
weepin_pegasi82 thanks
and so you dunno what you need
hell, i had to look up how to get the third boss
I kind of now miss the whole tattle thing
because i thought i needed a musical sticker
when the thing i really needed was completely different
derp:P
although i do know they drop hints sometimes during the fight
It said I needed the faucet besides the sponge, but I never used it because when I got sprayed I didnt get poisioned
and sometimes the enviroment hints too
it just told me to get something absorbant
after i looked it up
ZOOM OUT
how far are you exactly?
Just beat the third boss yesterday
Manearion: If you're talking to the mod, its best to ask nicely.
ah
*it's
then you wouldn't know about the fifth one
Actually I do
ah
Oh sorry...
I just tried to skip forward on the stream.. *facepalm*
i like him being the boss and all
but it's just so out there
EY TEGLO GIT UR PIC WHERE I CAN SEE IT PROPER 'KAY LAD
everythign else fits the level
and then you get him
wjat game are yall talking about now?
gak ant
Stoker Stair
Delish <3
never heard
New Paper Mario game for the 3DS.
At first I thought the Leaf sticker was a joke item, turns out its pretty usefull combined with the Battle Spinner
i never used it
i get excellents naturally
<.<
Sigh, how can anyone listen to this music..
wub wub~
Malmortius: a lot of people can and besides if you don't like it just mute the stream and listen to your own music
I am now :P
Its strange how music taste can differ so much
because this music is almost disgusting to me.
its like audio cancer
good to know
you know what's disgusting?
Oh jesus..mute it and stop bitching
them Communist Terrorists
05jstu casue Manearion is here
<3
Yes!
YES
Åskfödd~
lol
Shouldn't you be able to see the right ear?
Malmortius: u gotta give it time man
Bet you there will be some hair poppin' up there Malmo!
Malmortius: dude he just started
Nääääär jag går ut i bnland
Seeeeer jag ett vinterland!
usually you map everything out first :l just wondering since theres no indication
cant rush perfection
*ibland
Well Malm, if he puts up enough hair there, you wouldn't see it.
Malmortius: it's called layers and you toggle them on and off so they don't get in the way
Oh hes already done the right ear
?
Also I have a tendancy not to map things out when I start drawing, I can't speak for how Teglo does it.
back, my mom allowed me to get back (somehow)
dem rubber band sounds
Welcome back Dark92Enigma :)
It's a jaws harp...
WB
>Rubberbands xD
...
wow:)
......
......................................................................
Do not spam, gravy.
yeah don't put gravy on spam!
The bent leg looks a little too short :P
Malmortius: wrek is the artist he will fix it if HE thinks it should be fixed
hey Wrek quick question
Thats the worst opinion ive ever heard
positive critism is always good
opinions are forbidden here
Some times it pays to be blunt
When you're working on your own artwork its sometimes difficult to see whats wrong with it
this is the internet, Opinions are landmines
stop lying Malmortius
you're just being a darn dirty troll
no im not :l
no i agree with his last post
Hey Malmortius :)
/me ahem
best pony ever :3
I said the front right leg is a bit too short, how is that trolling?
It seems as though we got a NEAIGHHH sayer here...
o dear
that was awful
trolling
That was bad.
So, so bad xD
Scoot-Scootaloo: A NEIGH SAYER!
I love the Power Glove. It's so bad.
Its usually the way with fans, isnt it. If someone admires a person more talented than they are, they think they can do no wrong, so they'll defend them blindly.
yep
gak
I think the joke went over his head.
I love getting critism on my work, being blunt without trying to hurt your feelings is a good thing.
Some times it doesnt pay to make people feel good when they've done something wrong, it sometimes works to be blunt
gak
it's more you're an ass who always complains about every thing , so why shold we listen to you
i dont complain about everything, just.. a few things.
Hey, I'm an ass who complains about everything and you people listen to me
Meanwhile complains about everything
he doesn't complain, i've only seen him critisize
i didnt say you should listen to me i said not to be so touchy on critism
Buytoast: Yeah, but you're a lovable ass, like Meanwhile~
ugh x.x
Meanwhile doesn't complain, he states fact.
^
nothing like ruining the day with a bad neighbor
well i do that too
like yellow quiet being the best horse
Meanwhile is a nice guy, be nice to him >.>
Fact? he sure states things the most negative way possible
You really don't.
and white selfish being the worst
stop overreacting guys, jesus.
Internet fight!
told you.. internet
opinions are landmines
And how is "the bent leg seems a bit short" the most negative way possible?
i can not see her mane
http://tinyurl.com/d7n79cm
Gotta go and make pytt i panna!
^ Fitting for this
ant hes drawing it as we speak
We don't take too kindly to "opinions" and "criticsm"
I'll be back Teglo <3
What is this, Murrika?
Wait, manearion
Not sure if serious scoot
Opinions on the internet are myths
Hmm?
like Bigfoot
Are you possibly swedish?
:D so fuuny
Indeed!
:D
So am I :P
Uncle Sam didn't fly into the sun to give birth to the new nation of the world just for opinions and criticism to pollute it.
Tjosan!
ohai
Tjenare mannen!
apple troll
But I do have to go now.
