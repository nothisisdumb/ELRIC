Did the same with the Wii. Didn't get it till a year layer when Mario Galaxy came out and Smash Bros was on the way
thing is i'm using that ultra high power design
Saxy: Swag. Now ask that girl out.
The long intermission is also entirely exempted since it's more brony and less pony
11,02fluttercry: But...the launch lineup is awesome D:
Dat IRL SaxyPretender
does this refer to a long number or an irational number
0,14I should take a picture of myself with the persona cards I got at NYCC

05,15Only Zombie U looks interesting though

PInkie just more so
OohShiny: Maybe the cows can do it themselves
Nope
Ah, it's a box.
otakon: But Pinkie is Super Special, as Cranky said.
my mom told me that if a faun tries to touch you in a place that makes you feel uncomfortable
THATS NO GOOD
/me slaps himself on the head

How is everyone?
and another thing, I thought that the cows would only give milk to their hmm.. I forgot the word. But you know, baby cows.
Have you gotten it checked out?
Buytoast, this is 1944
Given how he reacted to the two rabbit hunters, maybe you shouldn't show him something that "might be nothing"
That was an incredibly simple lock, by the look of it. You're probably right.
Kandarihu: no, this is patrick
yeaaaa these guys are definitly facists

I can still use it
Crime against fashion again
Shizuka: Now I tell you a story so sit down
it'll wash out
Have you noticed, on top of everything it's raining?!
But the hard drive will keep getting worse the longer I do
i hope theres a point to this trippiness, not a fan of movies that are dark for the sake of being dark
So Shizu the Fresh Prince of Bro-State?
if a frog eats something bad it does that to get rid of it
Meanwhile: I liked that movie
she too cold
So I'm reading the wiki on Francisco Franco and his movement. They really picked quite the setting for this movie.
Dark for sake of being dark is aweosmen
Rain is best impromptu shower
VenHur: shizu is a girl, so... Fresh Princess
Hooie!

Bronysith: its pointless and pretentious
Oh...my bad.

"He's alive!" Not for long, "Bang!"
OohShiny, he delayed it long enough, by pushing the gun aside.
cachi01: needs more COD
lololol
twilight_sprinkle: Movie comes together at the end.
Needs moar prisoners of war.
oni_link: Meep? Nothing really, just one of those nonsense things you make up...
Kinixys: fair enough, thats what im waiting for

It's not hard to pick a baby could do it.
The_Awesomeness: norly

The_Awesomeness: he's such a stereotypical bad guy
potato_pony: pan's labyrinth

if i was the bad guy i would make all my enemies watch the twilight saga
The_Awesomeness: you fiend

Cannot even describe the rage I feel towards this captain

LIL John

Domo: Those are signs that you are normal and healthy.
I mean, I don't need my stuff to be dark, but so long as it's established early on, and does it with class, I'm fine with a dark film.

hey Sumica, https://dl.dropbox.com/u/51948537/img/wave_666.png up for a chalenge once the movies over?
Question: Do you believe?
IT WAS ALL A DREAM. Sad end achieved.
twilight_sprinkle: That is what we call
St least She die happy
which it probably is
:'(
Hallucinating.
It's left open to interpretation.
So, dead?
no yay! no!
Very dead.
08,01yay

twilight_sprinkle: That is what we call "moral ethics"*

But I think the point here is one of those "Decide for yourself" endings.
:'(
Aw she dead
Dead in the real world...?
not a yay moment
yeah sadly I'm going with dead
otakon: that's the whole story. it's a fantasy land that she creates to deal with living during the war

Depends on what kind of definition of innocent you're using.
So much cold-blooded point-blank gun murder in this movie.
It got so quiet...

Innocent in the sense of naive, she definitely was.

No fate but what we make, Twilight.
DocSane those don't even matter though
otakon: Tartarus was a seperate place, basically hell
otakon: so there is another alicorn?
so if Twilight came from hell and back is she related to Kratos or Dante
lol

Sumica: they did his hands too to forget about the pain in his foot
OohShiny: no... I don't think so

Twilight Pinkie Episodes Are Best Episode
Night Derpy_Hooves
Sneaky Butt Fun
and the guard thinks, "Darn mimes. Even at night."
Pinkie looks like a cat.
Pinkie thinks latex body suits are fun
08,01there's nothing fun about fetish gear.
Cya Derpy_Hooves
00,10were those lunas guards/
Twilight and Pinkie are a perfect comdey team.
....
I like cats
^^^
NO FUN.
Pinkie what are you into?
08,01HoodyNinja: i like beer
otakon: Fine by me
The same way Rarirty and Applejack are.
Sumica: they didnt have slit pupils
otakon: mares
I like Pinkie with her mane down
Cats hate me
twilight is now a HoodyNinja :)
otakon: Best Pinkie style is Old West dance hall Pinkie.

Pinkie, you're doing it WRONG.

Pinkie got a hood
HoodyNinja: dude she has a hood OVER her mane if youd didn't notice
HoodyNinja: Pinkie and Spike are the HoodyNinjas
Twilight ain't got no hood

Everytime When pinkie is with Twilight, Twilight always get hurt

STOP RIGHT THERE CRIM oh hey Twilight thane of Canterlot
How did he recognize her?

Domo: and that scoop
Kinixys: he's a guard in the university that recognizes CELESTIA'S TOP STUDENT
00,10Domo, mallet space
Read ALL the scrolls!
Kinixys: Because Twilight spent the last 10 years of her life in the Canterlot library?
08,01this is probably my favourite episode of season 2
08,01except for the finale
I like it
dat BGM is awesome

They see me trollin.....
And 2012 happened. The end
Celestia doesn't give a fuck
Happy Tuesday!
XD
She ai't trolling-- she's just being complementary.
Because you're Twilight Sparkle and this is a library.
"Happy Tuesday" There's no such thing, now Thursdays. . .:).
/me slowly paces around while mumbling to herself
00,10just what was Tia doing in that part of the archives?
no
ohh yea
she looks awesome
00,10just happens to be on the way?
trying to tell you not to waste her time
I don't have a favorite episode. Ponies are ponies. :)
Remember, kids: Never plan ahead.
Sumica: she knows when and where shes needed
HoodyNinja: Celestia LIVES THERE. I part of the Palace.
I guess twilight does this kind of stuff a lot, thats why no one cares
inb4 futur spike
hiya Kencolt what's up man?
Kencolt: Yes, but she has a bedroom, right?
^
cuteness_kitteh: so you like MDW?
cuteness_kitteh: WHY ARE THERE MORE KITTIES? >:<
MY theory: Celestia actually has very poor social skills. She's reading Twilight's correspondence so she can learn.
So why is she awake before the butt-ass crack of dawn?
This only makes sense if you haven't slept for days.
"I'm not a genius! I'm a chicken!"
Sumica YOU CREATED A TIME PARADOX THE FUTURE WILL BE CHANGED
and then twilightception
and faill miserably
Twilight just lied i know she will pace at a late time some time later
HoodyNinja: Which she doesn't usually use during the DAY.
OJ: wow, makes sense
OohShiny: Sorry, what now?
OohShiny: I do.
that reused animation
cuddly_kittehs: I just like cats... >.>
um yeah
This saved on animation costs.
cuteness_kitteh: *stare*
come to think of it, twilight may have wasted that important spell and single chance on something more important
Back to the Future reused scenes.
Kencolt: still a fun scene though
just to tell herself not to worry
Kencolt: But in order to say hi to Twilight in the library she had to be awake before the day
Epic Pony War
paradox?
cuddly_kittehs: *The Stare*
Which pony should be Raiden?
why not say dont worry about the future
PARADOX
PaladinDrakkenwolf: well yeah, it saves on cost and It makes sense. The same exact thing is supposed to happen so why re animate
FUCK LOGIC THIS ISN"T FUN
PARADOX
?
pony_300: There's more than one way to skin a cat.
Love Twi's face in this scene
and full circle is now
dam it just shut up and listen
00,10stable time loop

The doctor does not approve

Star Swirl is proud of you Twilight

It's where all the time turners are stored.

And then the Epic Pony War came...
Take THAT, Family Guy
xD
oni_link: hold on I'll see if I can find it
otakon: in the tardis

otakon: Taking care of a real time problem.
otakon: Handling the REAL disaster.
otakon: fighting cyber ponies
00,10some one had to make it and test it

Gunthler: Everyone miraculously decided to give a fuck all at the same time

Why is Pinkie Pie not using her ability
Pinkie Pie teleported?
Elements of harmany= If used other then at the end, a cheap winning move

The thing about King Dedede is apparently, he's the king because he says so-- and no-one listens. or gives a buck, or anything.
HERE IT COMES!

00,10only i cant seem to find legend of dragoon on the ps1 market place now
2 weeks now...
cachi01: Kickass
Sumica: yeah but theres no way to convert the games you already had from discs, so you have to rebuy them, which is absurd imo
I have the CD of that game! :)
all stars is totaly not a clone of super smash bros XD
00,10true twilight_sprinkle, I did't have many so i dont mind much
It is, but it has PS characters
If you buy Allstars on the PS3 you get the Vita version for free
defenetly not a clone
Imma still buy it tho
Vote rarity, for my heart. ;)<3
Sumica: i had about 8, then i broke my psp...again...sigh
Sumica: i got Legend of Dragoon but i have nothing to play it on :(
and then Double O Dash
as long as i have dissidia 012, lbp vita, uncharted and gravity rush then the VITA is awesomefor me
cachi01: played the demo of that on the old psp, didnt appeal to me
NocturnalBlade: get a PS1 emulator for your PS1

and 120 dollars for a goddamn memory is fucking overpriced
Inb4 springles is rong agin
Phase4: still having server problems?
HoodyNinja: i wasnt wrong, i was referring to the video
I DO WAT I WANT
Vita memory is horrifically overpriced.
/me dances on his table
SpeccyRush, found a viaduct server
/me dances
lol
SpeccyRush, new mode on that
its :3
/me spins dances
120 for memory?
What.
Phase4: tf2...?
16 GB Vita memory is $99 at my Gamestop
so HoodyNinja , youre actually the one whos wrong, as always :3
Phase4: whats the latency on that one?
YES
lol
twilight_sprinkle: Which in turn was wrong
http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/27371916.jpg

YES
Spiderman time! Woo!
im still enraged with tf2
SCREENCAPPERS BE READY

OMFG
keeps failing
I'm only slightly ever wrong, twilight_sprinkle
holy crap wat
HOLY CRaP YES
SpeccyRush, 240ms here
is this the actual show?
HoodyNinja: um no, there was a part where the author said "best pony status confirmed" which is what i was referrign to
32 GB of Micro SD memory is $29 at Walmart. Sony is gouging on Vita memory
SpeccyRush: Only if Rhino's around
twilight_sprinkle: Wich makes you wrong
richfiles: yeah they did that ALL for extra profits
http://emotibot.net/?i=830
HoodyNinja: lis and slander
*lies
Vita uses a specific memory card
00,10where do spider men come from
Azuredragon: perfect timing
Sumica: You know those noises you hear when you don't clean your closet for a while?
00,10oh god that face
They come from there
GAH!
richfiles: they were originally gonna have built in memory but NO that would mean people would be less inclined to buy cards. Also the whole re-downloading old games you already own to play on the Vita for FULL PRICE as a physical copy is absolutely criminal if you ask me
http://emotibot.net/?i=5603
mica play it fast forward
OH GOD
look at le animation...its so.....60's
I've been messing with flash since 1 MB cost $45 in 1996. Vita memory is overpriced for profit. The chips only cost SLIGHTLY higher than lower speed flash, not enough to justify triple the price for half the storage
Azuredragon: you're killing me
richfiles: exactly man
WTF
my GOD who thought this was GOOD?
Wtf r I watching?
NIGHTMARESZ
HoodyNinja: the ORIGINAL 1960's Spiderman series
Nerd!
HoodyNinja: 60's piderman
those faces D:
http://emotibot.net/?i=6161
I built memory cards for TI-85s back then. The chip cost is not that different between the various speeds. Sometime only a few dollars... or even cents.
I know that >.<
turning down girls for radioactivity
i choos girls over books but thats just me
But still, WTF am I watching?

Azuredragon: M's did not exist in the 60
60's*
00,10must not fap
lol
otakon: Actually, to some extent at the very beginning, he was. The earliest Spider-man stuff was about teenage angst and trials as it was about kicking Vulture as and forgetting to take names.
rofl
Wtf?

I cannot complain about old Scooby Doo anymore
talking to yourself is the first sign of insanity parker
Inconsistent model is inconsistent

Dem Drugs
00,10he's making his fap face again
he's on drugs only real answer
Alpha is most damaging but least penetrating isn't it?
no shit realy
>Turn down sex
08,01don't eat an alpha source.
>get super powers
alpha = cant even move through air
As opposed to a dead spider
...
twilight_sprinkle: Gamma, is most penetrating, but not as strong I thought
alpha were protons iirc
Or not as damaging
I'm going to be single for awhile...
gamma's still going to kill you
08,01twilight_sprinkle: gamma is an EM wave and is the least ionising
alpha will just kill you faster
00,10science
yea id turn down sex for super powers
Science!
This looks... old
08,01twilight_sprinkle: beta is a fast moving electron, and is reasonably ionising
00,10Evil_Spike, 1967
and thus petter parker became a super villian
I'd turn down human sex for a life in Equestria! :$
08,01twilight_sprinkle: alpha is a helium nucleus (2 neutrons, 2 protons) and is the most ionising
MY lamp :|
Johnny Quest?

Nah
00,10may's gonna come in and wonder what is sticking all over the place in his room

>simple doohickey
also dat music lol
How the fuck did he make that?
08,01gamma is the most penetrative, though, so gamma sources are generally the most dangerous
richfiles: then youd be a pony and hav p- nevermind
>never replicated by real science
Oh god, 60s Spiderman
why not the human spider?
08,01because you can receive a higher radiation dose from them
00,10alot of things to wing from over central park
yay! :( :)
08,01Tassadork: nope
Sumica: Two options. fess up to spankin it or reveal secret idetity.... >.>
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6ei9o2nR41r72cw7o1_400.jpg
skyweb
He has a lot of confidence in those webs
Yay
Tassadork: gamma is neutron, so no charge
>swings over buildings
08,01Tassadork: it is the most penetrating, though
Wtf is he holding onto?
HoodyNinja: The skkybox
I thought in medical tracers they'd usually use a gamma source though
HoodyNinja: onto the low budget
silk
thought that gamma radiation was electromagnetic, high energy photons
doesnt gamma cause cancer
video, luna, minigun, name, please?
twilight_sprinkle: That is a goo question -lol
twilight_sprinkle: Well surely enoguh exposure to any radiation causes cancer
What is he swing on?
no it cause Hulk
Serious lun
It's all about amount?
Dovah: Serious lun
thank you!
08,01twilight_sprinkle: gamma radiation is photons
00,10Dovah, "srs luna"
Cat does not like spiderman
SCIENCE!
OH GAIZ VISISBLE LIGHT CAN CAUSE CANCER
08,01none of alpha, beta, or gamma are just a neutron
And then this scene went on for WAY too long
bill nye the SCIENCE! guy
DRAMATIC ENTRANCE!
08,01ionising radiation made of neutrons is called neutron radiation
dat shakey city
And he never runs out of webs
now he's just showing off....
ever
wow dramatic
Well with powers like that
dat run
Dat lip synch
is it realy how it happend
08,01i like radioactivity
No
How can a neutron be ionising anyway, that seems so contradictory.
08,01i'm considering doing a masters in nuclear physics
I DO WAT I WANT
Spiderdick, Spiderdick...
FUCK DA POLICE
Spiderdouche
Dem eyelashes
00,10did he just swing through the window?

http://emotibot.net/?i=2720
Web just went throught the window...
Sumica: yes
So many degrees. O_O
my head
08,01a neutron absorption can cause emission of other types of radiation
The cop riding shotgun's face...my god XD
00,10nice parg job
here comes the regret
They found his drugs
00,10park*
08,01so a neutron absorption can, for example, cause a gamma emission
http://emotibot.net/pix/1673.jpg
08,01which ionises the atom
derp
00,10he's craped?

The first set of Dentures are already made. Then while my gums and jaw adjusts over the next six months, the second -- long term- set will be made more carefully, and precisely. But at no time will I be without teeth-- even if only false teeth.
nite otakon
Night otakon take care :)
otakon: Ahem...
11,02Night otakon :)

Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.
/me Hugs himself

/me Hugs kirzstryfe ^-^
Back when I was selling stuff from ebay I bought this real old walkman cassette player from this guy at a yard sale
You're lucky; my birthday is the third of May :S
I think I got it for 5 bucks, it was close to complete
/me Febuary 15th
February*
my best friend told me he didn't like black poeple. how do you all feel about this?
Is this the asl segment of the chat? :P
mines on the 13th
Sunday: Ouch :(
That was one of the reasons why I got it, but also because most of the cassette player was made out of metal
yeah sucks im not a rasict thogh
Yeesh, Sunday. Some people are just plain ignorant :|
not many things nowadays are made with metal, its all plastic
00,10his right to like or not like some one.
true
But based on skin colour?
i think he just needs ponies in his life
00,10dont make it intelegent Polydunami but it's still his right
checked it online and it was worth a bunch of money, I ended up keeping the headphones from it because the sound is real good
Right, I don't think I'll ever understand it anyway :S
I don't have a way to compare it to some expensive modern headphones now, but the sound is awesome on it.
compared to 10-20 dollar headphones from the store
oh that's cool, I never knew that
isnt tonight movie night?
It was.
and will be
oh what i missed it
lol
MORE SCIENCE
But you can still make it to the Euro movie night ^__^

Phase4: Any luck with TF2?
Mega_Milk, no luck with the mvm mode
yum caramel
EPIC MUCH!?
Most of my family are heavy drinkers too, they use to push me before to drink something :P
This makes things more of an epic than they really are :D
theres far too few servers and they're all crashing
Phase4: Have you tried the pony all talk?
But then again, I'd expect nothing less from a film.
11,02Does it air at 10 AM EDT?
WHAT IS THIS CALLED??
LUna Republic yay!!!
Phase4: I haven't even tried that yet, I bet it's chaos right?

I forget if it's 10:00 AM or 9:00 AM point is I'm getting up MUCH earlier before that for the season 3 premier.
I don't like things that are carbonated to begin with anyway

Ponies47: Try to get hear very early. That way you can read chat. :D
I tried wine once, didnt like it
sad gmod ponies in smf :'(
Why no just pull an all nighter? Becasue I have to go out later that day .-.
Everyone thinks I'm weird for that, but I can't drink it
*sfm
Think it was peter villa white zinfandel
so can i watch the premear here? or do i got to watch my tv at 7 in the morning
If I want to drink anything with carbonation in it I have to take it really slowly
My timezone EST so yeah 10:00 AM

Sunday: Depends
Like this ale which is starting to get flat...

So who reads fanfics here?
me
GMOD is "okay" for me, but I much prefer SFM.
your mom
Sometimes
internet y u fail so much
and Glitch's internet goes boom once again
i do from time to time ^_^
thaat fluttershy scared scream is cutie ^_^
I read them VERY rarely.
I'm a year older than you
I'm not really one to read fanfics.
I hardly ever read fanfiction. I think I could count how many FIMfictions I've read on two hands.
I'd mess around with SFM, but I currently lack the 10GB of free space needed to play with it properly
kirzstryfe it's been like this for 3 weeks already and my isp does not fix it ... i'm thinking about switching to another one
Maybe three
Ewwwwww Ayejay

Ohai brony2447 :3
Hi, brony2447. :)
Hello brony2447
Is any thing playing in the stream?
SharkMane, nope.
i just got over 130+ mods for TF2 and they are all MLP :)
SO MUCH PONIES!
Eww, ponies are gaaaaaaaaaaay >_>
hi brony2447
brony2447: Awesome. I need to pony the hell outta my TF2
AdamTheDuck: riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiighhhhhhttt <_<
Yeah, I was asking about LOST because I just watched the first character death episode today.
For the first time.
Ponies47: you havent done that yet? D: that should be a crime!
brony2447: I know ;A;
/me still hasn't modded his TF2
\,--is in a pny server on TF2
AdamTheDuck: *gasp* YOU NEED TO DO IT NOEW!
*pony
hey my enternet just derped
Why? I like TF2 as it is. :<
That's a funny way to spell internet :D
AdamTheDuck: :O
I'd enter YOUR net, if you know what I mean :3
You do better than me... I drink like, 3-4 cans of soda a day... >->
TF2 with ponys is better :D
^_^
ohai hacker, didnt see you there
oh wait...
Polydunami: would you enter a barbed electrified net?
I would if I actually had enough to drink 4 cans daily :P
That's why I play it on PonyFortress servers >.>
XD
I don't really want reskinned weapons, I like them as they are.
Seems awful stupid
Wow, this makes me glad I don't like the stuff
XD
My sister can probably drink a case in a couple of days..
AdamTheDuck: at least the voices?
Good morning Bronystate :)
I keep telling her shes going to be a diabetic but it doesnt make much of a difference
i could easily drink a case of pepsi in a couple days
brony2447, voices? So like scout with RD's vocie?
i mean come on, who doesnt want rainbow dash on their team
Good morning to you MadSurge
AdamTheDuck: eeyup
00,10ponyfort 2 ponys, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EryhQdXTjP8
I cant even if I tried
Hi, MadSurge! :)
What's everyones favorite drink? Doesn't have to be soda
When I was younger I didn't drink soda at all, whenever I did I'd get the hiccups because I wasn't used to drinking it. XD
hi MadSurge
Sumica: my life in one utter..
But I then I'd need to get scout a RD model to fit the new voice :<
Oh hey, MadSurge
/me utters brony2447
AdamTheDuck: which they have anyway
My how things have changed. XD
Its hard to go cold turkey on soda
/me uhhhhh leather BEEEAALLT
LOL
unless you drink the soda that doesnt have caffeine
Hey MadSurge
/me UHHH YOU STOLE MEH LOOT UHH
that is pretty much a typical WoW player
I could easily stop drinking soda if I did so after being sick.
WoW is way overrated if you ask me
11,02Refresh embed :)
00,10so for pony skins you have these http://wiki.ponyfortress2.com/index.php?title=MLP_Heroes
However, I have to get sick first, because the period of time not drinking it while I'm sick reduces my desire to drink it once I get better. That is, until I start drinking it again. XD
/me is dizzy from lack of sleep, meds and ear pain -__-
Yeah but it's having half the classes ponies and the other half normal
Well it's past 2 AM here, should prooobably go to bed. :P

Yay! Found audio driver for my PC.. I think! :$
someone should take Sumica's b day off the topic
since its done and all XD
NewSuperBronyU: keep the audio of and make the noises into the mic with your silly SB voice :D
00,10we have a topic?
twilight_sprinkle: awesome me like it so far
11,02Let me try separating the audio signal
geeky: yeah i have a few more, then imma be a bit afk while i prepare for sleep
NewSuperBronyU: output 30fps as most monitors can only display 30fps
twilight_sprinkle: ill sleep when im dead
geeky: no you won't you'll be dead. sleeping involves being alive
Weird... Getting ads, like if it were a live episode stream???
11,02Monitors can display 60 fps
geeky: yeah ive decided i need to sleep and eat more, have been feeling too tired lately
11,02I'm talking about the game
question why does SB always use livestream?
DeathStar: i denie your logic
SpeccyRush: Not always.
go me
Ohai DeathStar
Spell-of-Gaming: well mostly
11,02SpeccyRush: Because it gives the best possible picture quality
twilight_sprinkle: makes sicnes
night all
Just realized... Ihave no actual computer speakers. Driver still doesn't solve my dilema! :$
geeky: I'll eccept your denial when you learn to spell properly! >:3
11,02Night therainbowvortex :)
DeathStar: NO
geeky: mua ha ha ha ha
DeathStar: you evil fend
It've been cool to have a SSE multiplayer Wi-Fi
They actually planned one
It's still in the code
ded chat?
Yup, ded chat.
nope just sleeping
DeathStar: or dead
This chat would actually be more lively if SSBB was played
geeky: nope ^_^ sleeping
DeathStar: maby both
o'm guessing super brony is up to bat since i'm seeing galaxy
geeky: nope you need to be alive to sleep
/me huggles SB, Sumica and Ponies47
Well, technically, being dead is eternally sleeping.
NIGHT NIGHT!
DeathStar: no dead pepole in heven ..... your not alowed to sleep in hell
Panda: nighr
geeky~
night^^
/me Huggles Panda back "Good night my friend. Sleep well"
Goodnight Panda
/me hugs Panda
geeky: why would you think you need to sleep in heavin? I would think you felt energetic the whole time
I hate those vacuuming black holes. :I
DeathStar: heven is awesome sleep is awesome why not sleep all the dang time
Phase4: what time is the nightly round up normaly at
I still think this music is a little too boombastic for a platformer :D
JRP, no idea
geeky: maybe ^_^
DeathStar: lol v
Pffft, sleep. I don't need it. It's only about 20 minutes till 3:00 AM :p
DeathStar: lol with no v the v was a typeo
there is a massive stormb outside i need to turn the computer off
Ponies47: go to bred
:O miniboss?
I believe Super Mario Galaxy was supposed to be for the Gamecube
11,02It wasn't actually.
it died and became a star seems legit
twilight princess was
^
hell, the whole game is just mirrored
11,02Rayman Origins was originally designed for the Wii U :3
NewSuperBronyU: and it's still awesome on Wii :D
NewSuperBronyU: moo
11,02O.O
Something is technically wrong : is what twitter told me
No, I meant that Super Mario Galaxy was originally released for the Gamecube, one evidence supporting that fact is the Super Mario 128 tech demo.
11,02Moo o.o
/me hugs NewSuperBronyU
11,02Super Mario 128 was developed into Pikmin
/me hugs geeky back :D
SB was origionaly developed for the wiiU ^_^
Hello NewSuperBronyU :) don't stand too close to me, I'm ill and sleepy :D
Sometimes, Super Mario Galaxy's physics are really weird.
you can play as luige i want this game
sometimes?
/me glomps DeathStar :3
11,02MadSurge: Okies ;3;
11,02Get better ;A;
/me glomps NewSuperBronyU
So this is Galaxy 1 or 2?
11,02O.O
11,02MadSurge: 2
Luigi isn't available at the start of this game.

/me moos SB :3
/me is mooed at O.O
AdamTheDuck: are you a spy
/me Moos loudy
FFFFFFUUUUUUU!!! Still no sound on my PC!!! How can I enjoy Snuggle Truck: Brony mode without sound! :[ :$
mooo
I want Luigi to have that treatment for once, and Mario be the underdog :D
I made the mistake of reformatting my Wii SD Card to NTFS
richfiles: you dont
I'm glad it's over.
No geeky, I are a Sharpshooter.
AdamTheDuck: u lie
richfiles: Headphones. I just connect my headphones to my PC and it works
NewSuperBronyU: do u have a OC
No working driver. Stole my Mac speakers
Inb4 SSBB
11,02geeky: yesh :)
NU
NewSuperBronyU: i wan do a pic with my OC and your OC can i have pic of it
"Licensed by Nintendo"
Very funny, Nintendo.
NewSuperBronyU's OC is awesome ;3;
Nuuuu :D
Ponies47: your awesome as well
X marks how you properly beat down your opponent with a Wii remote when you are losing! :D
NewSuperBronyU: thanks
NewSuperBronyU: Dem eyes
NewSuperBronyU: dat ponysona :3
I wouldn't mind if Nintendo allowed Ace of Spades for a Wii/U game
11,02MadSurge: Moo :3
o.O i have this game for xbox360
A green haired pegasususususussssss
I think Nintendo made a mistake to allow to port CoD to their console
but Conkers Bad fur day
dat voice
bummer
NewSuperBronyU: YOUR MAKING MY INTERNET BILL EXPLOAD
man u die ez in this game
Imagine how fun it would be to micspam Slenderman in the Xbox versions of CoD
People would probably freak out
Hey everypony
Why, is it SO DARMN COLD
00,10ffa map eh?
Seems like it, though I don't get why I'm watching O.o
Oh wow, my semestral break is getting really fast.
Did that person's ovaries exploded
00,10ever notice super likes to aim for the nuts
Yay. Installing Java so intels website can do the work for me to find the right driver... I HOPE :$
8 kill streak? dayum
If this was Counter strike, he would have 1 million moniters in his head for haxxing :3
I hate new installs... So much stuff you take for granted is just not there! Flash, Java... SOUND! :[
Windows 7 is the most thankful for that kind of thing
00,10such a good run
Takes me 3 hours to set up Vista or XP, takes me 10 minutes to set up 7
Yukkuri shitte ne~
I am waiting for Windows 8
Eww
00,10win 8 is bad for gameing
^
it's the same friggin thing
...and see how many bad reviews it will get.
Yeah, older machine 2.4 GHz single core P4. I just need it to program Xilinx CPLD chips and maybe try some MINOR games on.
Let me finish, okay?
Running XP pro
'Win 8 is bad for gaming'
How
strip away excess features and all windows 8 is, is windows 7 with a faster boot time
00,10not optmised for it
Actually, to be fair, Windows 8 has had more change than any other OS so far. It's designed for tablets
Have you even USED it?
Dat first SB
11,02>2147182753
Windows 8 needs 2G of RAM to use
I remember reading Windows 8 won't have support for DVDs
11,02Totally not a hacker.
I decided to test out W8, and I've found it to run better then W7 performance wise, even with games.
Sumica: How much GB of RAM does your PC have?
3:00 AM? Time for bed. Night everypony and thanks for silleh stream as always NewSuperBronyU :3
00,10well the game developers are not impressed with it
00,10Serenity 4 gigs
LOL... I don't even HAVE that much RAM in this ancient beast. I think it has 1.5 GB RAM... AND it's mismatched! :D
Game developers can go cry.
Yeah, that's why.
richfiles: El shitbox will always win the prize for terribleness
Eeyup! :$
what does el shitbox mean?
It's my old computer
It was shite
okay lul
I replaced it with a mid end gaming PC
As long as I can program my chips... DANG... That CAD/programmnig app was 6.2 GB COMPRESSED!!! The install was 13 GB! :O :)
00,10no Jmo they will go with othere OS's
I can hook up my smartphone to my PC and see its screen
Problem is, it has 4-5 FPS
Spell-of-Gaming: That's because 1. Smartphones are parp, and 2ndly, they don't quite have the processing power
that's 1 reason
/me has windows 8
Its ok...
NewSuperBronyU: you broke my phone
What other OS?
I have NO clue about ANYTHING PC... How bad is Radeon 9200 SE... *waits for cringeworthy response*
Only got Linux and iOS
...Oh, did I saw smartphone?
*say
Yeah, heh
I meant Android phone.
And they already make games for them already.
Which is literally slow
That's even worse then
Unless a new OS pops up from Valve or such.
NewSuperBronyU: you will not belive how easy it is to hack wii games and abuse cheats
Good night :3
JRP: He knows, it has been like that since launch
At first I thought W8 was gonna have a ton of bugs and compatibility issues, but funny enough I haven't found any so far.
I'm kinda disappointed in Google not making an OS
Compatibility will be fine, but you'll need a monster truck to run it with stuff like Far Cry 3 and whatever

Only one is attached to teh PC though. Al three are attached to my Mac though, and I can run the TV as a 4th, but it gets slow, so I usually don't

THE old bronystate
Guys, one word of advice: DON'T LISTEN TO THE OTHER ITALIAN VERSION OF THE TITLE THEME :D
My computer. It has pixel real estate and storage... 18 TB, but no bawls under the hood... Mac is a measly dual 1.8 GHz w 4 G RAM, and the PC is only a single core 2.4 GHz P4 :(
i am back from TF2!
Yeah... That pick was from the night we played Airplane and Top Secret! :)
pic
all 137 of the mods worked!
Oh, most glorious of nights that was! :)
richfiles: Wow, where'ed you get Bronystate 1.0 from?
From back then
That's an older pic
Ahh

Wow. Full room. It was rather empty around 3-5 PM.

Nice! The socks make her at least 20% more fabulous! ;)
NewSuperBronyU: :<

I only have the old mowhawk Twilight and the two newer Large Twilight and Rainbow Dash plushies from Walmart and the three Twi, Dashie, and Pinkie mini plushes from Target. No customs! :(
And the funny thing is, I'm tempted to give them what they want.
Loads of money.
Just for a plushie.

Polydunami|LOST, pinged for sending me KP's Rarity.
Oh, you mean the one with braces?
Yeeeeeeeeesh.
Brace yourself
My body wasn't ready.
Ninjazz: ok fine Polydunami|LOST gave ya that one but i have this http://derpiboo.ru/133412
i have been a brony for 20 minutes now :P
they grow up so fast! ;:w:;
11,02;3;
Lunacorn: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2637/
Ninjazz: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/7ce66a404613faf0582f33aa10528b53.jpg she's even fabulous in CUBISM :D
SpeccyRush, my hheart....
Petrified_Discord: beer... in a kids show?
God that is the one thing I missed so much while I was here.
My heart in constant trauma.
Lunacorn: Cider
MadSurge, I think someone already sent me that one.
Petrified_Discord: i hope so..
Petrified_Discord: but anyway thanks ^_^
Ninjazz: she's almost identical to the real deal :D
Oh hey, a new brony?
Polydunami|LOST: ive been a brony for 20 minutes
MadSurge, that I agree with.
It's coming up to one year since I've started watching the show.
Polydunami|LOST: cool
It's been well past my anniversary for being a hater.
it's been about a year and a few months
Lunacorn: So how'd you find out about Luna? I'm assuming you haven't seen an episode yet :)
Ninjazz: mine is getting close :D
I believe I started after Sisterhooves Social aired.
Petrified_Discord: two best sisters
MadSurge, haha, how far we've come, eh?
Polydunami|LOST: actually, me too
Oh wow
Lunacorn: Portal or Resident Evil?
Petrified_Discord: i watched both
Lunacorn: Good choice :P
I didn't even discover Bronystate until near the end of January.
I think mine was... Hmm. I want to say after a Friend in Deed...
That was a rough time for me :S
apparently (from what i learned) celesia is an ass ans REALLY likes bananas
can somebody explain that?
>_>
Polydunami|LOST: first "new" episode was May The Best Pet Win and the first live episode was reading RD :D
Well, that's fandom for you
Don't listen to them.
Lunacorn: That's actually all fanon
Petrified_Discord: so she is'nt an ass?
Nope.
Same here, but with Cutie Pox instead of Pets.
Lunacorn: It's based on a flash cartoon where she asks people whether or not they like bananas and randomly sends them to the moon
Petrified_Discord: I remember this ghetto kid at school said i was a bitch who dont like bananas lol
Lunacorn: don't listen. People will make anyone the worst monster in history while trying to save the real villains because they're "just misunderstood"
Lunacorn: That's what it's from XD
Lunacorn: Lunacorn: The "banish to the moon" thing actually does happen though (to Luna). Bananas are just random :P
:O NOOO LUNA!!
So Lunacorn, have you watched any episodes yet?
hey every pony
you guys getting stream?
Lunacorn: But she was evil! Don't worry, she's better now :)
Yeah, but it happened once and that get fixed
Polydunami|LOST: only the best night ever
Oh, I see
Petrified_Discord: i hope so.. is she free?
Hmmm. A brony after one episode only?
11,02imma moo o-o
Ninjazz: its so FCKING AWESOME!
Lunacorn: Yeah. Watch the first episode (2-parter). It explains everything
Ninjazz: miraculous show :D
Petrified_Discord: okai!
Wait, did we switch embeds while I wasn't looking?
0,2Hey! are you getting stream
Lunacorn, then you're going to like the other 51 episodes.
Polydunami|LOST, yes
Ninjazz: holy crap 51?
ARGH. COLORS.
Phase4: lemme refresh-yeah, we get it
k
Lunacorn: The other Luna episode doesn't happen until season 2 though. It's the halloween one called "Luna Eclipsed"
Lunacorn, indeed. Try to take them in moderation.
Petrified_Discord: halloween?
Hang on, Phase. Websites slowly loading.
Right, I refreshed right before you made that coloured remark :P
Lunacorn: Yup. Nightmare Night
Petrified_Discord: makes sense
hey everypony are yall gona celerbate night meer night
No idea. Any suggestions?
how are things therainbowvortex
Yeah, I was watching a crazy show.
did you just say somepony? is that brony talk?
Phase4, stream's up for me.
Lunacorn: You REALLY gotta watch the show :P
Yes, Lunacorn. Just replace "body" with "pony".
alexxm: things are good are you doing anything for nightmeer night
But note that not everybody talks like that.
ahh ok and someone stays the same?
not really therainbowvortex
Basically, not everyone on the show is a pony.
oh
Polydunami|LOST: wut :S
Lunacorn: Yeah, when referring to ponies and buffallo twilight uses "anyone" and not "anypony"
Petrified_Discord: ok... buffalo?
You know of the little purple dragon Spike, right?
yeah, he seemed like a doormat or something
And instant hat.
DANG YOUR LUCK PHASE.
Heh, yeah, especially when concerned with certain ponies ;)
Lunacorn: he's the purple unicorn's assistant
Spike knows who's the best. He's alright.
MadSurge: you mean... sparkle or something?
Ninjazz: :D
Twilight Sparkle :)
Best pony
Lunacorn: Twilight Sparkle, yes, the "main" protagonist of the series
Polydunami|LOST: ahh ok... wait.. like the vamps? 0-0
Crazy name they picked after all the crazy vampire hubbub.
Vamps?...
vampires
But it's completely unrelated.
^
"Why do the vampires in twilight sparkle?" "Why do the vampires in me what?"
Oooooh. That mess.
Yeah, doesn't register with me.
suddenly boom
Yeah, I don't associate the name with the Twilight Saga either :3
ok.. so i have 5 names.. Luna Pinkie Rainbow Twilight and.. Celestia
Learn this name.
Rarity.
I say it alot.
what?
The white one with the curled purple mane and tail.
The beautiful purple maned, white unicorn.
11,02Night all :)
rarity? sounds like some snobby british dress-maker
Lunacorn: Oh yeah, her full name is Rainbow Dash
11,0222 days :3
With the maginificent squiggles.
Nacht SB.
bye NewSuperBronyU|Zzz
Lunacorn: And Pinkie Pie
Goodnight, SB
You'll learn very quick how wonderful she is, Lunacorn. Very quick or very slow.
Ninjazz: she seems wild, to say the least
Lunacorn: PFFFT
She's great.
Petrified_Discord: ?
Oh hey, the yellow one with the pink mane? She's Fluttershy.
Oh yeah her she's in the show too.
She gets mad and stuff happens to her.
And she's cute.
Rarity is the refined one. Overly melodramatic and such. A fair number of people think she's worst pony.
I guess. >_>
Not me, of course, but still :P
Petrified_Discord, good man. I like you.
fluttershy? seems legit
Well, she did get overly mad in the one episode you saw, but she's not usually like that.
Lunacorn: Last one of the "mane" 6 for you is "Applejack"
I'd say she got mad for a good reason for a lost cause though.
Polydunami|LOST: ahh ok so she isnt a crazy psycho bitch, then?
Blueblood... >__>
Not usually
Ello there.
Petrified_Discord: applejack? like the cereal?
And the drink.
'ey Malavolent.
Hey there, Malavolent
how've you been Malavolent
Lunacorn: Yup. She's the southern farm-working pony with the Stetson
I keep wanting to type "Malevolent" :S
hold on someone is spamming me on skype hold on...
alexxm: I'm fine, but the weather here is terrible.
cupcakes? seems cool is that like a song or something?
Oh dear, Cupcakes.
he keeps spammong me and telling me to watch it..it must be good
First warning.
Don't.
Lunacorn: Unless you like gore, DO NOT READ CUPCAKES.
Torture porn.
Pretty much.
Come on guys, spoilers.
OMG WTF!!!!! NOOOOOOOO!!! WHYYYY??!!! DAMMIT!!!! NOOOOOOOOOOO
slenderman?
For justice, Malavolent.
Yeah, Cupcakes is kind of peculiar.
you should have warned me earlier :'(
Lunacorn, fandoms'll do that.
Read: Fucked up.
Lolwut.
You read/watched it already?
i need a hug :(
11,02Lunacorn: My reaction to Rayman Legends being delayed.
/me hugs Lunacorn
Lunacorn: The other well-known fic is "My Little Dashie." It's super sad, so you can decide whether or not to read that.
/me hugs Lunacorn
Oh, the other famous one.
The other fic, yeah. It's alright.
thank you ;:u:; i needed the huggles
Not so much a big deal, unless you're sensitive.
Yeesh, I nearly cried at that one LOST episode
i think im going to read my friends fanfic
Check out Rainbow Factory, it's much more happier.
Lol.
:[
he says he comes on here, do any of yall know Brony2447?
Oh yeah, I've seen him around
Polydunami|LOST: he acts cool?
Let me do you a favor and recommend you Heart of a Dragon, Lunacorn.
I don't recall
Lunacorn: Just to make sure you know, Rainbow Factory is also gore
Petrified_Discord: o-o
Not too gory, it's more sad imo.
Anything is less gory than Cupcakes :P
It's not as detailed.
Oooooh Petrified_Discord, not true.
>_>
<_<
damn.. ive only beena brony for 30 min and i already got over 100 hate comments :(
damn trolls!
Lunacorn: On what?
On Skype?
Petrified_Discord: skype
STAHP SPAAMIN MEH! :[
Oh well, c'est la vie :)
oh forget it, im signing off
Yeah, comes with the territory
Just gotta love and tolerate the haters
umm?
Or ignore them, that works too.
That too
Uhh, that's kind of a cliched statement, "Love and tolerate"
Misused as well
Sometimes
ok..
Taken to the extreme.
It's an overused statement but still
i saw this one pic that said "I'm going to love and tolerate the sh*t outta you"
This one: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/887/
That's probably the correct usage. An anti-troll weapon.
But now it's in a different context. >_>
ok...
Yeah, I'd find that horribly obnoxious.
http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/140/529/ilvr7b.jpg?1318992465
Same.
That one, I'm okay with. It's funny
There's one more good one. Gotta find it...
srry guys i have to get off now cause my friend is taking his computer back :(
you wanna guess who?
Right, don't be a stranger Lunacorn
Pictures usually tend to be a joke along with the phrase.
It's brony2447, isn't it?
Polydunami|LOST: yup.. thats what i get for staying at his house :(
Again, don't be a stranger.
Polydunami|LOST: okai but i srsly have to get off now so i will see you
See you :)
See you later Lunacorn :)
Later.
Found it http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw3529-anti_hate_shield_by_metalbeersolid-d4brl09.gif
bai everypony! thank you for educating me!
Is that what we were doing? :S
...
Well, that was fun
ohai bronystate :)
i see you met my friend
Yeah, Lunacorn's a lot of fun
great! he's an awesome guy!
brony2447: So it's up to you to get him to watch the first episode, you hear? :)
Right, I was about to guess his gender otherwise -_-
Petrified_Discord: yup
That was the season 1 finale, though.
?
Petrified_Discord: hes watching applebuck season now, for some reason
lolwat
Best Night Ever.
you should have seen the look on his face when i first told him about mlp
he was like, umm..no
That's my sister's take on the craze
but then i made him watch it and he was like "omg this is amazing"
and i showed him this site and alas! he was on!
Yeah, my family knows that I've watched and enjoyed the show. They don't really care.
literally seconds after being a brony
My familiy don't care. Too much.
i'm happy i could get him to join :)
At least this way he didn't have to wait 7 months for season 3
A smark remark here and there.
So is everypony else
Seven months? Has it been that long already?
Polydunami|LOST: eeyup
so what does the halloween update bring to team fortress
alexxm, new hat :P
lol he was clever to come up with lunacorn, too
dinner time
Wait, that's more like six months. Six and a half?
I lost count.
Six and two thirds?
Oh Phase4 was streaming the whole time?
AdamTheDuck, that i was
AdamTheDuck every update does that
And then you made Phase sad.
Bad Adam.
XD
I was playing TF2 with him Ninjazz XD
Petrified_Discord: lol hes begging me for the comp now
HI LUNACORN
And you weren't watching the stream at the same time, Adam?
he says hi
lol should i let him on?
I feel like I'm on TV :D
Lol.
Ninjazz, but... But... I had kill cam to see him :<
brony2447: Sure :P
Fair enough, Adam. >_>
<_<
Petrified_Discord: okay then im watching applebuck season see ya for now
Righto
im back!
Doing the tango now?
say what?
Ohai Lunacorn
Wait, I meant to say "Tag team"
Tag team tango
:D
Polydunami|LOST: i suppose so.. he only let me on because i kept punching him in the arm..lol it got really red..
lol jk he is just nice
lol
You can just /nick to switch, you know.
Ninjazz: thx!
Yup. np.
he was telling me about derpy too
:P
6_9
is that her?
Lunacorn: Yup
Indeed she is. Are you offended?
Started from a mistake in the first episode
Lunacorn: Oh boy...welcome to the world of background ponies my friend :D
Petrified_Discord: no why the hay would anypony be offended by that? she's cute! <3
Lunacorn: It's a long story. Don't worry about it
Petrified_Discord: well brony2447 said the hub disgraced her name.. i suppose i will learn later
Yeah, she became a major hit with the fans
ohboyherewego.jpg
hey every pony i have a friend here with me he dosent belive males ove 12 would like mlp so can i have a show of hands wo is male and over 12
I'm 18.
22
i am 15
I'm 14
brony2447 is 14 too
:D
he wanted me to tell yall :P
lawl
Lunacorn: In a nutshell they finally gave her a voice but some people found it upsetting that she sounded kinda...retarded. So the HUB was in a sticky situation where they couldn't keep it up or take it down without upsetting somone
Aww, that was supposed to be a surprise :(
Lunacorn: They ended up changing her voice and bronies got really pissed about that
Petrified_Discord: oh ok.. well it really doesnt matter as long as they acknowlege her!
Petrified_Discord: you talking about derpy hoves
Eeyup
Yes, the drama and stupidity that revolved around that.
On both sides. >_>
Lunacorn: it was because the voice actress wasn't aware she was supposed to voice act a mare, so she gave her a boyish voice
I don't think so...what makes you say that?
Which apparently means Derpy is a retard
Yeah. Tabitha voiced her.
Is that really why she did the voice that way?
Apparently.
Petrified_Discord: yes
Whoa, I forgot I still had Google Earth open
Huh.
Whelp. Still don't care :D
My computer was hardly slow
She took her out of her credits when the crap hit.
retards dont act like that.. ive had PLENTY of experience with REAL retards
MOVING ON!
i mean actually mentally
Please do.
I am fine with both voices though :D
Same.
Lunacorn: Another well-known background pony is "Lyra Heartstrings" or just Lyra for short
Petrified_Discord: i saw that save derpy video and it made me cry a little
Dead Island will do that to you
Petrified_Discord: you mean the "ew, gay!" pony?
Speaking of Islands...
But I still have to say, the boyish version of Derpy saying "Yeeeaaaaah, Applejack! Whooooo!" is a bit cuter, imo.
Lunacorn: yeah
Petrified_Discord: brony2447 just showed me that :P
Nah, I'll save the season finale for tomorrow.
tired
Night everypony i'd better hit the hey so a see yall in the morning ok night yall
Good night, Moopy
Lunacorn: There's one scene where she's sitting like a human, so it spawned the fanon that she's obsessed with the mythical creatures known as "humans"
night Moopy
Petrified_Discord: wut.
Lunacorn: http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/006/162/friends_by_binaryninj4-d3bzvxe.png
Lunacorn: so what do you like? Videogames, books, movies, coding? :)
I don't remember this at all, Petrified_Discord
Lunacorn: irk?
Where was this?
MadSurge: many things
Polydunami: in Dragonshy, for a split second while Pinkie was counting ponies
MadSurge: mostly books
Hehe, are we trying to explain Lunacorn all the different background ponies? :$
Polydunami: I think it was in Dragonshy. Pinkie Pie was counting ponies in the park
Right
I didn't think to look :S
now brony2447 (whom i will now refer to as erin) is showing me shrugging ponies
You have A LOT to see, Lunacorn. Tread with caution.
(Me scaring the newbie)
Ninjazz: o rly?
Lunacorn: in a nutshell, it's very likely you will find fanart/fannames for all background ponies :D
Yes rly.
inb4 the... Plushie... :$
NO
Lunacorn: It's funny how he hasn't even seen a full episode yet and we're starting off with background ponies and memes of all things XD
Ninjazz: dude, someone tricked me into r34.. i can handle anything
no i do not want to see that thing again
Plushies? Like the plushies everyone has been smothering me with?
Over $500.
My eyes.
My tears.
Ninjazz: What else are we gonna do with them BUT smother you?
Why so costly :'(
Lunacorn, good man. Just watch for the hardcore stuff.
Petrified_Discord, YOU'RE EVIL.
:D
YOU SURGE, SPRECTRUM_RUCH ARE ALL EVIL.
o_O
oh celestia.. now Erin is explaining clopping.. uhhh....
DAMMIT ERIN
STAHP
YOU STOP THAT SHIT RIGHT NOW
Especially since Val is here.
Hide the drugs!
MadSurge: you too so am i
(this is erin) o rly?
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1372/
Petrified_Discord: that is pretty much his reaction
(still erin
Alternatively: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2307/
okay i give the comp back now baii!~~
Bye Lunacorn

You fool alexxm! YOU FOOL!
(this is lunacorn)
ok hai guyz!
(No idea who Erin is >.<)
HavokOC: erin is brony2447
:o
/nick...
Lunacorn: Okay, I gotta ask. Why Applebuck Season as a first episode?
Petrified_Discord: *insert shrugging pony here*
shrugpony.jpg
Fair enough :)
Petrified_Discord: plus erin wanted to show me big mac
Aha!
Big Mac. The only character I can quote before he actually says anything :P
and now all i can think about is ponies
which is not a bad thing
Just bear in mind that episode 1 (and 2) has Luna. Soooooo yeah
Petrified_Discord: ok? thanks
Ponyville Confidential is by far Big Mac's star episode.
He was an inspiration.
Also exposition. Soooooooooooooo much exposition
NUUUU! bronies!? Y U CONFUSE ME??
lol what are you confused about?
Petrified_Discord: so much stuff being shoved into my mind.. so much....POOOONIES!
Okay okay
Step 1: Watch episodes 1 and 2
you should be ashamed
haha
I feel like I'm talking to Doctor Jekyll here
:D
I guess my warning about taking things in moderation is not being heed.
wut?

If this game had better sound assets, this would immersive as hell.
Ohai Dashie_Dashie
Hey there, Dashie_Dashie
The dashie has been doubled!
how've you been Dashie_Dashie
hallo Dashie_Dashie
Lunacorn: also, never ask for ponies, chances are you will get the older ponies :D
It's weird that I call myself Dashie_Dashie when pinkie is my favorite.
been good alexxm. :p
MadSurge: uhh.. damn song stuck in my head... thx alot bronystate :|
It's weird that I call myself Ninjazz when Rarity is an obession.
Ninjazz Wrap Up, Ninjazz Wrap Up.
Shoobedoo?
Does SB still do space ponies?
oops srry madsurge that was not directed toward you
Wait wut.
:>
has anyone any idea how to change or repair the bass filter switch of a medion amp?
Lunacorn: wait until you hear the show's songs~ like At The Gala :D
Stick a fork in it.
I'm confused and I like it. @v@
It's weird that I call myself Celestia when Polydunami is my obsession.
I bet you do.
Wait, what the hell?
MadSurge: the first episode i saw was the best night ever...soo...
Polydunami, you're a pretty princess.
LUNA IS BEST PRINCESS
>Downloading Yugioh GBA roms because you're the king of games.
Lunacorn: that's what I mean
Life's good.
..rofl
MadSurge: better than shoobedoo
Dashie_Dashie: watch out for the terrible AI :D
Whoops, I accidentally mistyped on purpose.
I'm really liking the enviroments in this game.
Polydunami: wut
THUNDER
Madsurge, my deck has smashed Yami 10 times in a row.
istn that guy cutting his left hand off?
Dashie_Dashie: :D
Jake: logic does not apply here
half my deck is trap cards and equipt spell cards.
as always
I can one turn summon blue eyes ulitmate and basically win.
half my deck is nothing because i dont have one :O
Oh yeah i remember the yugioh PC games those were fun
Dashie_Dashie: I heard the DS games are better at being a challenge luckily
I haven't gotten the DS ones yet, I'll have to order'em
night all
goodnight therainbowvortex
ok srsly can somepony come down her to texas and punch erin in the face he is SOOO annoying
bye therainbowvortex
It's time to du-du-du-d-d-d-d-duel.
Good night, therainbowvortex
Nacht therainbowvortex.
Goodnight therainbowvortex
Which Colossus is this?
BATTLE TEIM
so, I guess something is streaming
Am I the only one that thought Twilight princess took elements from this game?
cowvarkian: correct
You ever think he just imagine to himself "I have to kill this thing?".
Ninjazz: one might think that
Dashie_Dashie: nope, you're not the first making that argument
I would be.
Even when Twilight Princess was released afterward?
I'd say that it evoked a similar feeling
erin said somepony PLEEEASE add him on steam oh yeah and he said i told you so Petrified_Discord
This sounds rather LotR.
ah, now streams working
i only played phantom hourglass, spirit tracks, and a little bit ocarina of time
Lunacorn: Told me so what?
Petrified_Discord: beats me
I've played all of them except for Minish Cap
lolk
so iirc this guy is killing all these things for a girlfriend, right?
Petrified_Discord: gotta expect that from erin (he has ADD)
Yeah, cowvarkian, he's trying to get mono :P
LUUNA! I WANNA BE TEH POSTAGE STAMP!
Rather, get Mono BACK.
Polydunami: ah not the disease
Polydunami: but a person named mono
Yep
Polydunami: this is silly
well..
I don't think this could be well described as a silly game
^
Except when Wander is slip sliding all over the place.
what person in their right mind would set out to kill the last of a collosal breed of creature, just for a fucking girl
I think it adds tension, personally.
Polydunami: Especially if you add sound effects during those parts
"Wheeeeeeeee"
cowvarkian, considering how she's the only slightly living being other than that god send of a horse that isn't trying to kill him? Not by much.
Ninjazz: ah, well maybe that makes a bit more sense
Ninjazz: but still
Yeah, Luna is a taken name.
I know. I know. but look through it in his eyes.
Belongs to one of our moderators
And well, this is also a Japanese game.
Ninjazz: but when he kills all the things doesnt he get fucked over?
Ninjazz: I know
cowvarkian, I'm not sure... I haven't played this game. I've heard TONS of stuff about it though.
Yeah, most of them are Japanese games.
Polydunami: you mean teh ones caramel streams?
*the
No, I mean video games in general tend to originate from Japan.
Polydunami: oh, welll that works too
Except Dragon Age, most of the streams I've seen Val do are Japanese games.
I should totally play some anno
Jake: anno?
2070
ValtheJean: any chance you might stream Killer7? :D
Jake: oh yeah, that looked good
it is
Jake: good to know
now that i have the addon
Jake: >_> which addon
Now Killer7 seems awfully precarious to stream live, don't you think?
the deep sea addon
/me is playing TF2 and cannot take any pings (also just learned about /me)
Polydunami: yeahhhhh :D
its a complexity coloss now
Lunacorn: ping
cowvarkian: STAHP
Lunacorn: :p
Ninjazz|Away, pls dnt go ;_;
I've not played the game myself but I've seen it played before.
killer7, that is
Polydunami: but it would be great to see people's reactions to the game :D
holy crap erin has a ton of mods
Yeah, all the shit that gets real.
and all of the mods are ponies apperantly
all 146 of em
yea farmin sponges to make cybernetic stuff
Shit approaches an asymptote of realism
Our fandom is a very creative bunch.
Jake: seems legit
totally
Polydunami: this
Lunacorn: If it exists, there is pony of it. No exceptions.
at least i can send electricity wireless
Petrified_Discord: coool
Jake: through sponges?
no with huge antennas
Lunacorn: Seriously. Name any game/show/genre
Jake: made of sponge?
uhhm
Petrified_Discord: umm, what?
Jake: or with tesla like insanity
i think they are made from building blocks
They speak English in "What"?
Lunacorn: Just a proof that EVERYTHING has a pony version
Lunacorn: Actually foreign shows might be a bit obscure.
Petrified_Discord: umm... mario?
swimmmmmmmmm
hey hey hey
artist: yeh yeh yeh
Lunacorn: Easy peasy. That's got it's own group apparently
http://static.fimfiction.net/images/story_images/35247.png?1340918314
Petrified_Discord: :O
wut
Anyway, I really should be heading to bed now.
Goodnight Polydunami
NO OH DEAR GOD NOW.
Polydunami: I remember sleep
Cya Polydunami
Petrified_Discord: wow, that's interesting
I just woke up half an hour ago
Polydunami: wats teh time?
For me, it's about ten to four in the morning -_-
its 551AM here
hahahahahaha
Polydunami: for me its about 6:50 in the morning
And no one is home except for me and my dog
cowvarkian: East coast ftw
erin kept me up with ponies @_@
its 12:50 here
Lunacorn: 551 o'clock :O
Petrified_Discord: for now
?
Wait, do you mean 5:51 Lunacorn?
good night Polydunami
Petrified_Discord: oh nothing you must worry about
Polydunami: why yes i do
/me worries
Oh wow
ah ps2 memories, how i love you
Right, I should be off now. See you ponies later on in my day -_-
Petrified_Discord: now erin wants me to watch apple.mov
I'm out of here
is it safe?
Lunacorn: Well...yeah, but...
Lunacorn: The safest of the bunch
Petrified_Discord: but?
Lunacorn: Actually yeah watch it :)
Contains swear words, and that's it
It's just...the mov series is...the mov series
2,14 if that sort of mindlessness entertains you
That's all I can say about that :P
I found it funny
ValtheJean: well we all know you hate mindless entertainment
dat jappleack
lol he is laughing his ass off
what mindlessness?
artist: go ask val
Well, it;s nothing but retarded happenings
Serenity: those are the best happenings
XDDDDD
Better than "The Happening"
Serenity: except for the other ones
If they do it right, yeah
the other happenings are usually better
f*ck you i can eat all these apples >_>
artist: china
artist: Britain
Serenity: thats funny

Serenity: your millions of dollars of tea
One does not simply throw away tea
artist: china

artist: shadow of the collosus
Lunacorn: yep, thats basically it
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mb7vdepkb91rrxbq2o1_500.png

of course, i cant go home to ireland anymore so i might as well make the best of it
Lunacorn: why was ireland destroyed while I was asleep?
cowvarkian: what?
Lunacorn: what
cowvarkian: strange lad...
Lunacorn: He means why can't you go back? Was ireland destroyed yadda yadda yadda
you guys have to stop derping about
artist: good luck with that
/me derps like a motherbucker
Petrified_Discord: my parents are like: "ohh.. its so much better here..and i was like uhh...no..
^ good choice
Stay in Britain, where the weather is retarded and where I live
what are we playing?
they have fast food there......
Petrified_Discord: Dammit!
Petrified_Discord: oh well..
Well, to be fair, I think 80% of Ires say that Ireland is a pretty crap place
Serenity: liew
*lies
Opinion, not fact :P
Lunacorn: are you irish?
MadSurge: one might think that
MadSurge: my blood, heart and soul!
Lunacorn: you have irish blood? thats a little disturbing
Oh those stereotypes piss me off
Lunacorn: then you must have an irish accent! they are funny....
cowvarkian: A quarter of my blood is Irish
hai, i'm back :3
artist: not really anymore
Serenity: so it's whiskey and gin?
dammit
cowvarkian: NO.
its more refined and fucked up now
I don't drink, for the safety of other
Lunacorn: you have nifty folklore monsters :$
ye, we all know how Serenity is like drunk
I'm quite sober thanks, now shush
Serenity: I knew that the obligatory irish joke would backfire on me some day
What is with the riding physics in this game
He starts derping max 4
Derp factor 8
Plus all that "beer space" goes to pepsi and tea
btw where i lived in ireland saint patricks day isnt celebrater

I'm 3/8 british, 1/4 Irish 1/4 Scottish and 1/8 Aussie
Lunacorn: I'm actually not surprised about that :P

artist: white?
whiter than a frozen jama
Lunacorn: that day is just an excuse to drink more :D
artist: Morbid, that's what
Serenity: your grand grand grand grand parents were assholes!

Lunacorn: >.>
/me will have to start posting Kyuubey to Slenderman pictures if he has too
Splat
Serenity: Id like to see that

Petrified_Discord: :<
Lunacorn: wait until you see Youtube Poops of ponies :D
MadSurge: toast busters
Lunacorn: roast musters
coast rusters?
Lunacorn: also Friendship is Fabulous :D
MadSurge: friendship is magnets
Lunacorn: magnets how do they work
I still thing Lunacorn needs to watch AN EPISODE XD
*think

Lunacorn: What a story mark crusaders :D
Petrified_Discord: just got finished with first two :P
Lunacorn: Yay!

Petrified_Discord: >.> o u
Ninjaaa
^
Petrified_Discord: what are you, flutter shy? :3
Lunacorn: did you like what you saw? :$
Jaymoooo
c:
:3
MadSurge: I want to be a pony, if that answers your question
Hey is ponysquare working for anybody else?
TequilaShotz: probably
Lunacorn: it probably sucks being a pony
artist: Lyra would agree
artist: go wash your mouth with soap
i mean a real pony, eat, shit, get ridden
artist: :|
artist: yeah, that wouldd suck
No it wouldn't.
Lunacorn: Nightmare Moon is great!
being a mlp pony would have been awesome though....
No worries. Have a human idiot to take care of me, life would be grand.
Depends on who's riding you. *gets shot*
Ninjazz: so, you would want to be a dumb, non sentient pony
being a equestrian pony is cool
i just realized that i opened tf2 two hours ago... and its still opening :S
the musics good
cowvarkian, and not have to deal with the world? Doesn't sound so bad, imo.
Unless you're talking wild ponies.
Ninjazz: you woulnt be concious
Ninjazz: you wouldn't be you
oh now i remember why i startem my othe pc. i just shut it down because i didnt remember
cowvarkian, I'd be a pony.
Ninjazz: you wouldn't even be
:P
sometimes i wish i was a cat, just sleep aaaaall day :P
You're looking at it from a human perspective.
Think like a pony.
Ninjazz: ponies dont think
PONAY
"Where the bloody hell is my food?"
"I hope there isn't any predators near by."
"Humans are stupid."
it loops!
what would be a pony predator
well erin is talking the comp now
Haven you seen sheep?
so bai for now
Jake: cannibal!
sheep must be the most retarded creature
canibal pony! run for your lives!
EVER
You know what's odd? Ponies are usually drawn to be cute and donkeys to be ugly. But in real life ponies look uglier than donkies. :/
artist: yeah they are pretty dumb
*donkeys
NewSuperBronyU|Zzz: hello
I like horses.
Ninjazz: Fine equines
cowvarkian: scared of umbrellas.....
Not crazy about them, but they're cool.
Im not sleepie <_<
and suddenly the game turns into sky serpents
artist: did you know that if you lay a horse down, and cover it up, it'll think its dead
That horse is loyal as hell.
Night JRP|Zzz!
Congrats horse. You're the new Rainbow Dash.
that horse is applejack as hell
Seriously, there is a sky serpeant flying close to the ground and all it does it wait for it's stupid human master to get back on it.
cowvarkian: so they are extremely retarded?
Ninjazz: Agro is best pony
its*
artist: yes, horses are fucking idiots
MadSurge, I agree.
:D
thats great
DED
the battle of Waterloo is going to have a VEERY different
outcome
imagine having any of the mane 6 as pets.....would have been so AWESOME
I'd prefer to think of them as companions.
artist maybe

*family
Lunacorn: Now we're treading into My Little Dashie territory...

Nevers

<This can only be viewed by Bronystate gold members>
artist: must we have one?
yes!
artist: if so, then metroid
artist: well, the metroid series
artist, either Doom or Duke Nukem 3D.
Metroid
Say metroid or I'll come to your house
JRP|Zzz: metroid
And drink your milk from your fridge
JRP|Zzz: I only really played the game boy and game cube games...
I'm tired
this game reminds me of god of war, just shittier
JRP|Zzz: then sleep you bastard
ninjaaaaaaaaaaa
Why an I still here

/me hits NewSuperBronyU|Zzz with a hammer
But
Hammer will hurties
JRP|Zzz: licking face only is slightly homoerotic
dam richt
Well it's better than hitting him with a hammer
JRP|Zzz: oh, I agree
JRP|Zzz: Im just explaining your actions
JRP|Zzz: I guess
I don't know, why don't we use a buzzer?
Ashens * runs*
Spell-of-Gaming: because mods arent servants
hai guyz what yall doin?
brony2447: using proper grammar
...a bell?

Snow?
artist: where are you
What snow?
I made music and eggs
cowvarkian: Apologis, sir. But it seems to me you forgot a period, and a capital letter. So do not tell me about grammar, thank you. Good day.
norway mothebuckers
*apologies
brony2447: you're welcome
cowvarkian: The feeling is mutual.
/me sits on Ninjazz

I cushioned myself for you this time, jaymoo. c:
JRP|Zzz: you're a person now?

"Forever is a long, long time whan you lost your way!"
brony2447: ikr
cowvarkian: dat pheonix
brony2447: uh huh
I feel like this game is rediculous
Spell-of-Gaming: it is
Spell-of-Gaming: I said that an hour ago
cowvarkian: oh so you are aware of teh band than?
brony2447: maybe
brony2447: what is it

brony2447: apparently I have heard them before
brony2447: just wasnt aware of it
cowvarkian: where?
brony2447: sounds like a song I heard on a commercial tbh
cowvarkian: oh ok
OH MY GOD
THOSE EYES
WHY ARE THEY TEXTURES SO BADLY
is this shadows?
TheMaster: yes
Spell-of-Gaming: because its an old game?
old games can be pretty boss
TheMaster: ikr
most of my favorite old games are tough to stream though
damn cornhead passed out
brony2447: lolwut
lets get steam values in here
cowvarkian: Lunacorn
brony2447: that makess less sense
you mean steam names?
cowvarkian: he's asleep
brony2447: oh wait... the corn thinf
nah the value of your steam account
my steam name is brony2447 (plz add me)
cowvarkian: he was the guy who was on asking questions
brony2447: ah
cowvarkian: just ask Petrified_Discord
brony2447: ok, cool
it wouldn't be accurate since not all of my games are from steam
/me is playing tf2
if only I could find the value of all the games I've downloaded on xbl
infernap12: $1405.50.
all that drm
just sitting there
as all old games do this one reminds me of baldurs gate.
killing giant monsters, etc.
so, why didnt he get on that one in the first place

Spell-of-Gaming: you're welcome

Good morning Lil_B :)
how've you been Lil_B
TheMaster: they're silly
If friendship is magic what is love?
hey AdamTheDuck Colt_Brovakiin and alexxm :)
Jake: Love is technology.
good good. Though spell-of-gaming was the one asking questions.
interesting
/me greets Lil_B with a hug.
or asking for asked questions
Oh, never mind...this is #15, Argus
Jake: love is chemicals
Because, you know, online dating
do you put the milk in the bowl first or do you put cereal in first? spell?
/me Ninjazzhugs Ninjazz
I put cereal in first. :3
TheMaster: cereal
Love is made from love atoms. because science
/me is going to do SCIENCE
which colossus is this?
Lil_B: one of them
Is your coffee with milk or sugar?
Lil_B, this is the 15th colossus, Argus
cowvarkian :|
OtakuTom thanks
TheMaster: Seperate spot.
TheMaster: who needs ketechup when you have potatos
this one doesn't look like it'll be difficult
TheMaster: ikr
so whats the heroes problem with the collosi? Did they beat him up and take his lunch money in school?
aim the laser at his balls!
it's slow
easy prey
TheMaster: he's trying to get his dead girlfriend back
by killing giant monsters?
TheMaster: and a demon asked him
necrophile?
oh okay
TheMaster: but the demon's going to fuck him over in the end
DaringDerpy, lolwut
if he can kill giant monsters like that, and the demon can't, why doesn't he just kill the demon in the first place?
TheMaster: because plot
The demon's going to rape him?
DaringDerpy no , in that case he wouldn't care to bring her back to life :P
Spell-of-Gaming: no he's going to turn him into a demon
Spell-of-Gaming: or something
Ah, okay.
no john, you are the demons
and then john was a zombie
Spell-of-Gaming: I don't quite remember
taste the light!
taste my shiny sword
that glows for some unexplained reasn
*reason
it glows? must be orcs
Sorry but I am new to this hole thing, what is the laser beam doing? :P
so someone told him when he slaughters these things, he magically gets his gf back...
seems legit
Glowing swords are cheesy
DaringDerpy: yeah
Rusty swords are where it's at.
say that to stannis baratheon. glowing swords are boss
/me is being hipster
DaringDerpy: and apparently him and the girl are the last of his kind on this planet
stannis is the dragon rebo..wait, wrong fantasy series
It's not that the sword glows or anything. It reflects the light from the sun and exposes the weak points of the colossi.
OtakuTom: that makes much more sense
OtakuTom: and I'm being sarcastic if it wasnt conveyed
Plus, it's a fantasy world, suspend your disbelief :P
^
Inb4 jump.
send the last one of his kind on a suicide mission
problem solved
OtakuTom: fuck suspension of disbelief I SHALL FIND ALL THE FLAWS
GERONIMO!!!
due, I suspend my disbelieve enough in reallife
due*
dude*
Why did they have to make this on PS2, anyway
Spell-of-Gaming: because thats what was out
It got an HD remake on the PS3 long with ICO.
Spell-of-Gaming because it was the most popular system in this generation
Spell-of-Gaming: this came out in 2005
along*
Hai everypony, more Caramel stream?
Hm, 2005?
careful with these blood fountains...the pressure might destroy your eyes...better wear safety goggles
Wasn't the GC out by then?
DaringDerpy: seems legit
Spell-of-Gaming yes, but not so popular
besides, this was published by sony
oh, that explains everything than xD
I honestly don't understand why Sony and Nintendo can't apologize to each other
Spell-of-Gaming: for what
Spell-of-Gaming: nintendo being better than sony?
Er, no
Nintendo has sort of ran out of ideas
its just mario and zelda these days
Guise wait, let me grab some popcorn before you start.
Wasn't there a console where Sony and Nintendo worked together?
what happened to original titles and series that can also get popular and get 300 rehashes
Spell-of-Gaming: not that I can remember
Debate time
PC master race.

poor golem
XAX: go away, nobody likes you
And after that, they allowed the Philips to make games

Oh lawd

Ninjazz: But you can't!
burn him!
I play PC and Nintendo :P
Malavolent, oh whoa as me. I can't hold mouse and controller at same time?
What world do we live in?!
Ninjazz: I mean, how can you flame, when you play both?
Malavolent: because why not
and I play some games on the PC, with a Controller :P
Malavolent, that's the point. I don't. :p
Lil_B: this is sick
I see the benefits and negetives of both worlds.
Ninjazz: Get off my browniechat D:

Lil_B: we only had frost here
Lil_B: It is snowing here as well, but it's raining at the same time, so...
Oh God. I actaully kind of missed th !cd spam.
DaringDerpy: beardy mountain people...
DaringDerpy: sounds like any south I know
DaringDerpy well, just climb a little higher on these mountains and you'll get snow as well :P
cowvarkian: http://www.volksfestfan.de/bilder_2005/people/images/_DSC0097.jpg a typical south german
DaringDerpy: hmm
DaringDerpy: cool hat
Do£hWithRainbows
DaringDerpy more beard and less Stuff on the hat :P
that'S abavarian. if you ask them, they're not german
Tree the left leg ValtheJean
Try
the thing on the hat is his winter beard
DaringDerpy: o u
always ready, in case it snows
hm...
I killed the chat
yay
DaringDerpy: you're welcome
harumph harumph
so is 2012 an a or a b movie because it was on first last night
huehuehuehuheuhue
Lil_B: where are you from? stuttgart?
alexxm: b
alexxm, it's b, Sumi had to leave early or something so they played it first.
DaringDerpy Hessen, mitte links, ... "ländliche" Gegend :/
AdamTheDuck: what does sumi actually like that movie?
cowvarkian, that was his lottery wasn't it?
AdamTheDuck: hmm
oh
Indeed it was.
cowvarkian it has probably the best CGI ever, I say that as a good thing
Lol.
<3 Pan's Labyrinth
>inside it'S hand
I only like disaster movies like airplane...
>vitals
Cheeeeeezy as hell though.
That was such a lovely movie
lottery is today?
DaringDerpy: sure
hmhm
DaringDerpy: by sure I mean yes
by hmhm I mean ok, thx
Man this one is taking the longest to kill.
DaringDerpy: well usually when I say sure I dont even know the answer
Ninjazz: hmm
does anybody here like Dragon Wallpapers?
Lil_B: elaborate
What kind of dragon?
ok, I guess I can post it, it's not a Video link, just an Article with the Links to the Pictures
http://www.howtogeek.com/127610/desktop-fun-dragons-wallpaper-collection-series-2/
2,14 actually no, that isn't allowed
2,14 it's still a non-image link
ValtheJean but, it's a non Video link?
2,14 the rule is non-image links
ib4 ban
*inb4
obey the rules!
Lil_B, rules is actually "no non-image links"
Oi. He gets it.
AdamTheDuck yeah, just looked them up again -.-
we have no rules about punishment :(
we do DaringDerpy
2,14 the rules about punishment are: don't break the rules and you don't need to worry about punishment
so, he dies everytime he kills one of those things
ValtheJean: thats strangely vague
2,14 last collosus
2,14 and now for an amazing ending
Dear lord I hope it was worth all this madness.
Ninjazz: it wasnt
madness?
THIS IS SHADOWSOFTHECOLLOSUS
bad architecture
Ninjazz he won't get laid :/
Lil_B, aaaawwwwww.
2,14 cowvarkin that depends on how you interpret the world/mythology
THIS IS LIKE LEGEND OF ZELDA ALL OVER AGAIN.
^ XD
Time to go after Malus, the final colossus
Ninjazz it's dangerous to go outside alone
was this made by the people who made ico
Lil_B: take this
Lil_B, he's got that horse with him.
And my bookmarks are a bit out of order for me to properly respond. :/
So no funny picture responce.
It's not safe to go alone, take this.
I think I even have the Soundtrack to this game, the composer hat a strange name, Cow Otani I think
Mooooooo
Kow*
Ah, color
you know, the theme song of berserk fits suprisingly well with this game
Lil_B: that makes more sense
I know I love the Final Boss Music, has a really really slow pace as far as I remember
JUMP
Hey Val, is this all open ended? You can choose which one you want to kill first? Or is this broadly linear?
Dark_Horst: >_>
2,14 the latter
Ah. Makes a good feel of being expansive at least.
xD
I mean, Goddamn look at all this open field.
Ninjazz I bhet i'ts nopt so big when you are a Colossus :P
Whoa, is this Shadow of the Colossus ?
bet* not*
mrf.
it is
oni_link: yes
awesome
mornin all
Kurra: yes
oni_link, yes it is. And it's near the end, too.
hello oni_link and Kurra
Lil_B, well considering how the last one Val killed was stuck in a rather small spot for a colossuss, maybe not.
good morning Kurra and OneTrickPony|Zzz
Hello Kurra
Afternoon, Kurra.
I feel so free ^_^ hey there Lil_B
'ey Kurra.
* oni_link :$
Hello.
tab fail :P
Man, typing with one hand is hard.
dem Automatic-Doors
Kandarihu: that kind of sucks but at least Im here to see it
Heya Ouroboros
lol
Kammerjunk: I could do it
Wait, that came out wrong.
Kammerjunk: well, I did it when i had my wrist broken
2,14 prepare for ;_;
Kammerjunk always include that you are holding something to eat with the other hand -.-
Nooooooooooooo
oh COME ON
;~;
NUUU HORSEE ;~;
Lil_B: I tend to forget that.
What are we watching?
nooooooooo
WUT WUT .
NO.
GODDAMNIT.
I hardly knew ye
Ouroboros: shadow of the colossus
Noooooo, why'd the poneh have to die? ;~;
Thanks.
You can't just fucking kill off the best character like that.
Hopefully that horse will still be able to teleport, but then again, I know when to call gameplay and story segregation.
hi Ouroboros
cowvarkian: You get used to it, I s'pose.
Hello.
Kammerjunk: yeah
Hello Ouroboros
Salve, Ouroboros.
Kammerjunk: thats a nice latin you got there
its amazing how he can climb with a sword in his hand
ha true
it'S amaziing how he can climb while jumping
cowvarkian: I'd say "It'd be a shame if something were to happen to it," but it's already dead.
he j8mped up a goddamn wall
that'S not how peple climb
Kammerjunk: heh, yeah
Dark_Horst: he's not a people
I got to get this game
lol cowvarkian
<.<
be quiet...shh. its sleeping
nevermind
it's like Night on Bald Mountain
those are fucking huge snotballs
<3 this song
wow already the final
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Power Puff Girls intro
fire photon torpedos
Dat PPG Intro.
quick, use your dagger of time
2,14 stupid clunky ass jump mechanic
Long way down...
TheMaster: hah
I wonder how many times val will die before he kills this collosus
Ah, so it quicksaved at the beggining of the boss battle, and restored you to full health. that's good.
Ninjazz: enough to have to take a breath on the way down
that ewas close
SpeccyRush, damn near.
I dont remember but did this game ever get a sequel ?
oni_link: why would it
Eyo
Ico is the sequal
oni_link: what is there to follow up on
cowvarkian: well not like a true sequel , I mean more like a spiritual successor
SpeccyRush: Ico came before...
Both look rather similar in terms of style.
cowvarkian: yeah and this is supposed to come before it which makes this the prequal
so whats this colousus supposed to be a tower?
its on top of the tower
SpeccyRush: I'm fairly certain that the two games aren't actually connected
SpeccyRush: and that shadow is a spirtual succesor to ico
spy!
ah, well that makes more sense cowvarkian
Ico was first, then came SOTC (developed under the code name NICO, a combination of the Ni (Japanese for 2) and ICO), and now they're working on The Last Guardian (code name Trico, Tri for the word "three" and ICO)
I mixed up ICO and this game
woops
SpeccyRush: cool story
Dat copypasta.
very funny
SpeccyRush: I found it so
not helping Ninjazz
no more pics for you
Sorry. :c
D:
OtakuTom: any word on the release date for that project?
¬_¬
so close
SpeccyRush: and just because the lead designer said he thought it was a prequel ,and not even because of canonical nature, then how would that make it a prequel
I don't think they've announced one yet. It's been in development for a while, though. Hopefully it's not much longer.
2,14 this is the prequel to Ico
Last Guardian
2,14 the ending shows that
I would love to see that and I hope it comes out soon
thank you
SpeccyRush: you're welcome
I have to get all of these games, and a PS3 :( next year hopefully
well... atleast my heart's not going to be under alot of daaww related trauma any more. :c
I'll miss it so, though.

Hai everypony, Im back
DerpyMuffins: liar
Welcome back DerpyMuffins
DerpyMuffins: also, welcome back
I was afk cowvarkian
DerpyMuffins: I know
DerpyMuffins: I'm just messing around
these things are big, but they dont seem very smart
This collossus is like "I don't even know what's going on."
I don't think blood flow works like that
Most Collossus are peaceful
it does when you're that big
TheMaster: you sure?
are you an expert in collosus biology?
i dont htink thats blood
2,14 now for the amazing ending
TheMaster: are you?
Who's to say that the colossi don't have unnaturally high blood pressre? XD
these things dont look very roganic
ValtheJean, good morning
i'm a time lord, i'm an expert at everything
Lyra`: indeed
TheMaster: ah so you're that master
2,14 hello lyra
TheMaster: didnt you die?
morning cowvarkian
the one and only
it was all a part of my master plan
hah
Hai Lyra`
TheMaster: to die?
i feel like its a 'eat ice cream and feel fat' kinda day
More green
its just what I wanted you to think
Lyra`: those are fun
the master never stays dead
morning DerpyMuffins
TheMaster: your body was burnt
I love those kind of mornings Lyra`
i'll get over it
TheMaster: on a pillary
Ninjazz: seen wreks Luna?
Oh so there is more humans.
...
SpeccyRush, nope.
Ninjazz: http://derpiboo.ru/131324
only because
its Luna
You'd think they'd have to put blinders on those horses just to prevent them from chickening out at those heights.
Kandarihu: one might think that
Ooooh. She looks rather slender, but I like his style of coloring on the mane.
08,01morning all
08,01well, afternoon
08,01i smell really good
war horses usually have a high tolerance for bullshit
it'small training
08,01i just put on a freshly washed Derpy hoody
Ninjazz: the eyes man the eyes
*it'S all
08,01i smell fantastic!
08,01and i've never smelled the same as how i do right now
SpeccyRush, He did good work aside of the rather empty foreground. But I'm not complaining.
hehehe
08,01except for maybe when i think of how i smelled that day when i smelled the way that i do right now, right now
Ninjazz: oh you're no fun
08,01Dark_Horst: i get that question a lot
08,01but no
hm. however could that be B)
SpeccyRush, What? I liked the eyes too. :c
Oh dear god what.
08,01oni_link: i get that a lot too...
any pony eps coming up?
What in the world...
oh thats not good
use the force, luke
dead
or not
Aaaaaaaand DED
ded
and now you transform into some horrible eldritch creature
Does he look ded?
No.
So he became a collosus himself?
He doesn't.
thats not how blood works
TheMaster: eeyup
again,i dont think thats bloos
awwww damn you dun goofed
clearly undead I'd say
Lil_B: well duh
quick, hero, achieve a moment of pure desperation and use your behelit!
wait...wrong series
She's still dead, dumbass
aw
cowvarkian don't "duh" me
Dark_Horst, I still think they have unnaturally high blood pressure in this world :P
Now he looks dead.
Lil_B: duh
Aaaaaand ded for realsies
Arrow to the leg
hi everyone?
cowvarkian stop it or I will complain online about
And all the collosi he killed were for nothing.
hey Snow
Lil_B: duh
Okay wut.
and now he becomes an apostle
whats streaming?
Snow: Shadow of the Colossus
hi Snow it's Shadow of the Colossus
Ohai Snow
yes, borrowed
Hai Snow
name sounds so familiar
how've you been Snow
well... I guerss it's ok if they give the body back later...
Is it time for badassery?
:3
oh so now you're a collosus
so he's a colsousos now?
time to crush some people
alexxm|colt: you could say that
YOU'RE THE FINAL BOSS :D
Or, the shadow of one ;p;
now you get to know what its like
I mean ;p
actually, you can do nothing in this moment really
*insert soviet russia joke here*
So, would his weakspot be in the knees?
there is no way to change anything here
^
So this is a wait to die moment?
yes
Ninjazz: mostly
Yup
he used to be an adventurer
/me licks AdamTheDuck
Well that's dramatic.
Take as many as you can
hey everyone
now hes just taking arrows to the knee
how've you been RainbowPie
hi RainbowPie
odd
hi JRP
i got a reply
Good alexxm|colt and you? :) how are you Lil_B
Ninjazz: the moral is don't listen to booming voices proposing bizarre deals
<.<
i'm good RainbowPie
RainbowPie it's cold I have work to do, and I don'Ät want to
MadSurge: so, religion is bad?
2,14 or is it?
Hello RainbowPie!
Hello everypony :3
MadSurge, I have a confession to make
morning Ponies47
MadSurge, well considering how his friend was all dying and all, I don't blame the dude/monster.
how are things Ponies47
cowvarkian: yes :D
hey Ponies47
Ninjazz: I do
Hai Ponies47
Ninjazz: heres a trick, find new friends
hey Ponies47 :)
That's nice, cowvarkian.
RainbowPie: you like ponies?
/me keeps Lil_B warm, Problem solved :D (im not doing your work for yout though :p )
Heya Ponies47 :)
i got a reply
how odd
MadSurge: theres that, But my other confession is that rainbow dash just happens to be best pony
You're a Collossus Thou
cowvarkian, most, but not all.
¬_¬
RainbowPie: I disagree, but it's your preferences :D
Holy shit does this guy ever get a break?
how does one pick best pony, i just can't fo it
MadSurge: haha i know you do im just kidding, because spike is best pony....
Kandarihu: so what, which religion isnt bad
RainbowPie: :D
good morning everypony :)
*do it
oherro kirzstryfe
morning kirzstryfe
kirzstryfe: I hear it is that
Hey Kirz.
hello kirzstryfe
Hai kirzstryfe
I though Vivi is best Pony is part of the rules
^
how are things kirzstryfe
spike is best pony
hi kirzstryfe
2,14 it's not a rule, it's a fact
Discord is best pony
ValtheJean that too
Tis a good fact.
Aaaaand destoyed
spike is best rainbow dash
A fun fact.
*r
ValtheJean, Lil_B sorry but spike beats Vivi
lauren faust is best pony
TheMaster, what...
Ninjazz: the only fact
Inb4 kick and ban.
DAMN IT.
TheMaster: hah
kinda mean ValtheJean!
TheMaster: spike is best rainbow dash
RainbowPie no, he doesn't, thats a +3 Fact
no wait, a changeling is best pony
SpeccyRush, the only thing we can look foward to.
2,14 I'm not the one committing heresy
ValtheJean: herresy is fun to commit though
heresy most fowl
ValtheJean: everyone has their own opinion :p
RainbowPie: thats funny
lol opinions
RainbowPie: you've apparently never been on the internet
Well at least all that stuff he did wasn't wasted.
2,14 except when it's fact. Either accept your crime or be forever a heretic
opinions are overrated
OH, so NOW she decides to resurrect for no adequate reason
ValtheJean: I'll be a heretic
no Queen Chrysalis is best cause she can be ANY pony. so she instant wins
correction, Chrysalis can -look- like any pony
Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. No matter how wrong.
ValtheJean: Hey im just playing around :D
Ninjazz: hitler had his own opinion too
And he was entitled to it.
Here comes the sad part
so, we're talking about hitler now, eh
Why in the name of bloody hell does Hitler ALWAYS come up in this kind of conversation?
I love when these debates over best pony emerge :3
the horse lives!!!!
and Godwins Law envoked by Dark_Horst
....how the heck did the horse survive?
yay agro
because pony
AND THE PONY LIVES TOO
now hes off to play in that never ending movie...
Im baaaack! After 2 months!
...holy shit the feels.

cowvarkian: exactly
/me thanks cowvarkian for telling her whats going on.
applejack268: you're welcome
guys, i am back
Last Guardian has been on hiatus for years and the creator left the dev team, but Sony won't admit that it's dead because they'd take a stock hit from it
2,14 the upcoming ending proves two things (or at least implies), 1) this is the prequel to ico, and 2) the Dormin was not entirely evil
hehhe
applejack268: >_>
Dormin is the protag of this game?
so ut we doin after this thenw
>_>
applejack268: <_<
Ninjazz it's the Evil demon
i repeat: I have no idea!
2,14 Dormin is the spirit of light and dark, master of death
So the voice in the guy's head?
dang, zelda seems uninspired now . that bridge scene reminds me of the intro to Twilight Princess
hahaha wut duz >_> mean cowvarkian?!?!?!?
applejack268: no clue
i have been singing
we no longer have glass in our house :(
loool
more credits :)
artist: hmm
artist: meh, could be worse
hey artist
so wut we doin after the crediiiiiits!

Snow: yeah, the house still stands
wait, what??

Damn, that's a horny baby!

I didn't see anything of Ico, so I probably won't recognize the reference... oh, never mind.
how is babbie formed

I don't even...

Ninjazz: I missed you :)

naturesfury: looks like advance wars or fire emblem which are pretty much the same game lol except with gundams
MadSurge, I was just away to get pudding for five minutes?... What did I miss.
i dont know which chords i will be using for my song.....
Ninjazz: nooo, this week, I missed you
MadSurge, aaaah. I knew that's what you meant. I was being silly. :3c
oh god, this game
is there gurrenn laggen in this game?
yay
But yeah, I've been playing ME3 religiously this past week.
too japano ahhhhhhh
Ninjazz: :D you're a silly pony
wb artist
Ninjazz is best poni
What you mean by that Lyra`?
wut.
exactly
i need cookies.....
I'm garden variety pony.
No where near best pony tier.
chocolate will do!
nope, best poni
Ninjazz: the Italian VA of Rarity got better at being hammy! :D
:c
Okay, okay. Macross Quarter
:3
MadSurge, hammy?
crotch shot = 300 damage
Flirting agai Lyra`?
am i?
i cant even tell anymore.
ha
Lyra`: more like 9001
because f*ck logic
Dat range.
TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON!
what song is this?
MadSurge, she's done us Rarifans proud.
because japan
Ninjazz: so far I hate only Big Mac's VA :D
N O P E when i disagree, im macalicious
MadSurge, nothing gets me laughing more than Poland's VA for Applejhack.
Applejack.*
Get out of the way, other window.
so, what are you guys doing?
chat? chat! live!!!
EVAs are cooler
why is this supposed to be a good game if all the robots one shot the enemies?
Ninjazz: AJ's and Fluttershy's italian VAs... are the same person :D and they sound nothing like each other!
2,14 how are you supposed to be a good viewer when you complain about content you don't like?
^
hahahahahahahahahahha
:3
boom
someone should suggest evangelion for movie night
it just seems like theyre overpowered, ValtheJean
You can't expect much from kids nowadays.
You got told Lyra`
also, according to you, im not a good viewer T-T
2,14 that's what happens when you're on your 23rd playthrough
ooo there gurrren laggan
SIMON??
Lyra`: New Game + benefits. He's working to unlock Hard Mode
whats the greatest candy ever made?
oh, i seee, MadSurge
this games so...so japanese
Lyra`: he needs special points that you get only by ending missions successfully.
>23rd playthrough
...
teirra was so op i swear
Robots require dedication :D
ValtheJean: was the first playthrough hard?
So op
inb4 reply
2,14 very much so
ValtheJean is cheating with his prior experience
Lyra` is the only one I seen mouth off to the mods
Lil_B: hey there
=D
the mods know i love them
Oh you've seen nothing yet, DerpyMuffins.
hi Sonny :)
2,14 she thinks we don't pay attention to what she says
Lil_B: I'm gonna do the live-stream again in a vew second, want me to share you the link?
how've you been Sonny
in pm then
my god these guys talk sooooooo much
Which you dont most of the time ValtheJean
good alexxm|colt :)
Sonny ok, anyone else there?
not yet still need to open it
2,14 just because I don't respond to it doesn't mean I don't see it
naturesfury: it's anime robots, talking is a free action :D
im really not worth paying attention too, most of what i say is either 'flirting' with someone, or a sexual inuendo.
you can invite people if you'd like
to have conversations etc
not very good conversation matterial :D
2,14 which is exactly why you're getting closer and closer to another ban
ValtheJean: that sounded like a PSA for bullying lol
i like this game alot, for what console is this?
good morning everypony :)
Hello BladedWings :3

DerpyMuffins: I was, less then 2 weeks here I posted a link to gore, I got the ban hammer for 1 hour, it felt like forever

Ponies today?
l8r
Lyra`: so you fix both machines and people? :D
yeah, just dont go to bed for a few hours to be sure youre fine :D
/me Cries on oni_link's shoulder
The_Engineer: then why are you sad?
i went to school for people
pony_9046: No ponies here
Because this time it hurts 2x?
and am learning machines thru hands on, because im in the EVAC platoon
well..i got nothing
BRB getting breakfest
ValtheJean: for what console is this game?
big O cant have more than like 2 attacks right?
we're the actual line medics. the ones that go outside the wire, and get shot at
Ponies47: well that part is over, youre here now and thats what matters. that, and you learned from it :P
Snow: PSP
ah ok thanks
Big O!
awww yeeea big O
I let my chikorita evolve instead of keeping it small :/
and is this a game?
The_Engineer: yep
Hope you dont get hurt Lyra`
Well its weird
The_Engineer: you should have cloned it or gotten another one :o
ive been stabbed before
BIG-O, IT'S SHOWTIME!
its not so bad
doesnt hurt as much as getting shot.
How to heck do I clone?
>.>
The_Engineer: what game are you on?
the dreaded ememy phase...
Pokemon:Heart Gold

The_Engineer: Giant robots from anime getting together to fight a bigger and common threat

Well, they're all fighting each of their enemies individually more or less.

The_Engineer: Yep, daycare. Your best bet is to pair the one you want with a Ditto
So S3 spoiler ads are now running on The Hub?
good morning
I dunno, I'm looking forward to episode 3 of this season, based on the title alone.

cowvarkian: The daycare is the red place right?
CRAP
The_Engineer: sure
ValtheJean: whatever you say, george
My GF wants to go out on the 10th
where is the egg making area though?
cowvarkian: :P I knew about that but I mean I have yet to spoil myself and see teasers or look up a synopsis of the episodes
I'm going somewhere on the Nov 10th, but it's later on in the day so I won't miss new pony episode :3

Ponies can wait

Baih MadSurge
I got a GF to please
Bye MadSurge
BladedWings: if only
isnt it though, Sumica?
About time for Sumi to ninja the stream
i saw an episode about abandonment, and smoldering anger
i aint got a life soooo, no excuse for me to dont watch ponies
I'm only 14 so I has no GF :/
oni_link: then i'm a lucky one :D
watch ponies with gf
no excuse Ponies47
BladedWings: you sure are :P
Sumica: ikr
that buffer
Bad excuse Ponies47
Sumica, that was a prominant source of conflict in children's cartoons and folklore ever since I was a little kid. It's only graphic if it ACTUALLY happens, which is NEVER the case.
I think it's time for that girl's cartoon now. :)
The stream stopped?
mine did
I'm not the only one who sees that pound puppies is blatantly ripping off hogans heroes
am I
same
2,14 it's time for saturday ponies

ponies? in this stream? what is this shennanigans?
i know its early but happy halloween or happy Nightmare Night
owww, my ears. I had the sound on max when earbuds are connected
Yup, I'll use this one :D

Why is granny smith watching anyone other than applebloom and her friends?
Scootaloo Pinkie Pie
hehehe
00,10warning now, they will spoile a bit with the advertisments
he got gobbled up
yes, but when you've been forced to watch it so many times, episodes can get a little stale
Sumica: cool
Ponies47: Pinkaloo :O
00,10far more then what they just showed
kirzstryfe, ever watched them all in 24 hrs?
And the Hub's gotten into the spirit, look at that Hub pumkin logo
00,10so i recomend you dont watch
Sumica: Season 3 spoilers? You broke da rules!
/me hears a yaye
It's torture, man.
Ninjazz: I have
oh what i miss
WHO THE FUCK SAID THAT?
for s2 premier I did, stayed up for that run
oni-chan?
Ninjazz: I have too
fine, Sumica, but you cant stop me from looking at your OC in the corner
For some reason, she didn't use a sewing machine or her magic.
france guys FRANCE
kirz, o_O
france
other than that, no, because I'm pretty sure you can't watch every episode within 24h at this point
very best france
cannot unhear france
oni_link, cowvarkian, kirz, my crazy bros.
In un mundo splendido...
WILL BE RIGHT BACK?
<.<
hmm
Sumi, if that's the case I'll be tuning off. I've done a good job staying away from the spoilers.
TheMaster: ikr
that dog looks familiar....
Ninjazz: can you blame us? :3
Pinypon? MORE LIKE BRONY CON
Ninjazz: Or just mute and switch to a new tab. We could ping you when it's done
BWAHAHAHAH
Fred!
these commercials are geared for little girls
cowvarkian: more like commercials period
/me Boos at The_Engineer
hence the low quality
Never seen a S3 spoiler since I dont even have the Hub
oni_link: that too
Is this stream originating out of Boston?
who the hell is fred?
the funniest thing I read so far was the HUB being banned for spoilers
Floam?
VELMA!!!
DerpyMuffins: me neither!
dat rap
Oh man I haven't touched Floam in forever
these ads are meant for little kids, obviously they're low quality
any belly bros here?
...
belly bros?
did I hear her say cocks?
sumi rule still applies right regardless of advert right?
O GOD
STOP IT
better
you're outside the target demographic. would you rather they advertise the latest R rated movies and the next season of game of thrones?
TheMaster: yes
haha
they wouldn't advertise GoT, wrong channel :p
J_E_Smith71, If you could, it would be much appreciated.
ive had enough of game of thrones
id love more game of thrones referances
idk but they could make them better
2,14 TheMaster: welcome to Bronyism, the egocentric clusterfuck where people forget the show isn't catered to us
He's got a whole WING in the library, Twi.
Ninjazz: Well they just had one and the ep's back
ValtheJean: thats us
RD is dressed as shadowbolt
also brb
on the internet, no one knows your a pony
J_E_Smith71, thank God I paused.

xD
Pikachu XD
I wonder what Luna thinks of RD's costume.
spike=ded now

Anyone else see Octavia a few scenes ago?
Spike=Barney
^
Barney scares me :<
Derpy!

how many of you wish they were skinnier?
what is zecora suppose to be. because all I get is Dark Elf
She has a MAGIC.MOV Rainbow Dash afro wig
Zecora is awesome o3o
a witch?
TheMaster: I think zecora is dressed as zecora
scary pony thingy
lol
She's the element of creepiness.
J_E_Smith71: :D
TheMaster she is dressed as a witch doctor
so she's herself?
TheMaster: yeah
shes the internet!!!!!
You gobble things by swinging?
DocSane: apparently
why would anyone believe this?

nightmare moon was deafeated.

Luna isn't there because she's in this episode. Obviously.
Sumica: :D
Not the OC's! D:

artist: Fancy Pant's trophy wife/girlfriend.
Excuse me for a second...
even zecora's like "i'm outta here"
oh DocSane i remember her
please ping me when the commercials are over
disney channel sucks
or you could mute it
artist: the cartoons are ok...
HUB > Disney channel
woah hold on. they're putting leelo and stich on the same plane as the rest of the disney classics?
cowvarkian: but everything else....
Squallken: I like how you think
i call shennanigans on that
TheMaster: I did, and have a separate IRC client.
PURPLE

TheMaster: And why not? It was one of the most popular of their movies in the last 10 years.
00,10oh god how many of these pet things will they make
>seat pets
Seat Pets...?
Sumica: all the things
thats just like the teddy belt
Sumica: They will make pets for everything
i won't use the real spelling
because you know what seatbelts need is an annoying large cushion on it to aggravate ansty kids
ah im not used to watching commercials :(
i call toliet pets nexted
oh god i had one 12 years ago
DerpyMuffins: yes
Sumica: enough to for every kid iin the world and more
DerpyMuffins: we are
DerpyMuffins: No, kids are dumb enough to beg their parents for these.
they are not meant for adults
00,10before I went live they had hoodie pets
hello everypony
hallo Doctor
the idea is kids badger parents for the items they want, and the adults give in and buy them. thus the marketers are making them appealing to little kids
Hey Doctor
What's up Doctor
batman is scary....
its just a doctor, its not -the- doctor
yeah right.
00,10that ad was short
so ya when i think kids movie i think grimlins...
We're all idiots...with the world's largest military and nukes, so don't make us mad!
was that batman mask of the phantasm?

dat voice
artist: It's not so bad
she does look different
shes just to awesome
i wish everyone would start talking like her again....
Ponies47: dont lie....

cowvarkian: You broke da rules!
BAN TIME
oh look, visual metaphor
:D cowvarkian
cowvarkian: aw man, i thoght it was gonna be full of foxes and octagons
it would just be cool if luna appeared in s3 mor then 2 times
an excellently done visual representation of lunas internal struggles
oni_link: foxes and octagons?
2,14 looks like it's time for a paddlin cowvarkin
look at that, thats some awesome storytelling
ValtheJean: >_>
cowvarkian: just being random :P
Tis a Lie!
inb4 inb4 fun has been doubled
i think Luna's capslock is stuck
tis a cake
only three types of people can use the royal we. royalty, people with tapeworms and crazy people
yupp
oh
LUNA
TheMaster: we think not
Fluttershy <3
>not sure if can
ValtheJean, thats just innapropriate
Anyone else have an image of Luna wandering the moon, screaming at herself for a thousand years?
only in the badfics
>talks lower than yelling just now
Favorite Luna quote right here!

Mortal combat
All my favorite ponies are in this episode ^_^
oni_link: is vinyl there?
What was Luna's coat color as Nightmare Moon?
F is for friends who do stuff together

funfact, fun wasn't really a word in english 1000 years ago either
artist: IDK, is she? :P
she's so precious :P http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/File:FANMADE_Young_Princess_Luna.png

cowvarkian: N is for no survivers WHEN YOU!!
DerpyMuffins: Almost black. I think technically extremely dark purple.
luna i like it
Trixie theme.
"The fun has been doubled" if you play on the Pony Fortess 2 servers you hear that quote... ALOT
PANIC
TIS A LIE!
Ponies47: ALOT XD
:D
TIS A LIE
DerpyMuffins: go ahead
Hi guys
tis a good quote that
I love that line, Tis a Lie
TIS A LIE!
SafariMonkey: hey
TIS A LIE
greatest moment in this episode
Man, Luna is short tempered in a way Celestia totally isn't.
hi SafariMonkey
how've you been SafariMonkey
oni_link: You can never go on one of those servers and not hear that quote :P
further funfact. thee's and thous are actually the informal version of 'you' and 'your'.
DocSane: totally
xD
Raindrops <3
Ponies47: I know haha
Who was Nightmare Moon's VA?
dat face
hi cowvarkian BladedWings and alexxm|colt
"god damn it PINKIE" that should be a motto
so adorable <3
so if you've ever studied english or latin. with its formal/informal references to other people, english is always formal
00,10Same VA as rarity
way to fuck up everything Luna
what's VA?
Sumica Im doing trivia
voice actor
oh
00,10yeah no
FUS RO DAH!

TheMaster: glowing eyes? oh crap

oni_link: i can pings you :3
Rarity the skunk... :(
somwhere
00,10hub's newist show using pony VA's in an attempt to lure bronies to more markets
Is trivia banned Sumica?
tinkerbell...
artist: if you dont mind :)
they already tried that with carebears though
dat retcon
uhh
Sumica: marketing ploy indeed, I will not fall for it though
it was a one of a kind thing. the perfect storm to make MLP popular.
kinda cold for slurpees
Dat no name brand
Or perhaps they use the same VA's because it's easier that way.
who doesnt want to die in a horrible slow freezing death?!
00,10not banned persay but tends to encite alot of spam
Probably doesn't taste the same as the real thing
2,14 >implying everything else on the hub is automatically bad
https://plus.google.com/u/0/photos/109057955388579800288/albums/5755167248301274929/5802258643923995202 thats so me
I doubt Brony fandom really figures into their plans for Care Bears and LPS.
a few things made mlp what it is today. Specifically a unfavorable review about the show before it came out. It thus garnered the interest of /co/ who watched it. What started out as just ironic amusement at high production values became...this
>Implying that Implying is not Implying
dat implying
implying got rome destroyed in a year
Imply-ception
certainly a long way from 2 years ago
out of boredom i made a "top 10 mlp:fim episode list"
YAY!!!
Thing is, it /could/ be good.
oni_link: "
2,14 a long way down, yes
rocket ride on a rainbow?
00,10no they are not beting on it DocSane, but they do considder it
God, has it really been two years?
But it feels like we're being exploited, and I don't like that feeling.
yes. I remember when episode 3 came out
zombie next year?
yay
Twilight Sparkle uses lecture!
dance party
oh god the lecture
lets hope thats a clue :)
DocSane: it was super effective!
Not the lecture! D:
NO sad woona ;A;
luna used sarcasm.

Luna learned scarcasum fast
Ah, Tabitha <3

THOU TOUCHED OUR HAIR

No use use "thee"...
What is her chest piece and diadem made out of?
also celestia is going to send pip to the moon
Anno or drawing?
TheMaster: ikr

Celestia sends him to the moo...ah they beat me

You think Pinkie and Rarity would have been worried over Fluttershy chasing all their business out
she was in pinkies basment making cupcakes...
gangsta fluttershy is best flutter- wait... nope, nvm
Only you would think these things Sumica
Maybe she was just visiting Pinkie
Kammerjunk, and Bon Bon and mystery mare just HAD to be in the while this magical magnet was out in the day, eh?
