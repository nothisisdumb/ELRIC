ESCHER
I lied.
Paradoxical Archetecture!
YOU'VE CREATED A TIME PARADOX
My racism makes it hard to tell these white men apart from each other.
If you decide to go to Equestria and write a diary about it.The story in the diary will be similar to great expectations.

Crazy stairs.

But you're at the end of the staris
PIMX TARADOE
MC EScher. Best.Artist.EVER
11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIACEPTION: The "Penrose stairs" (with a woman perpetually picking up papers) that Arthur shows Ariadne is a reference to a lithograph print by the Dutch graphic artist M.C. Escher. The print is usually called "Ascending and Descending" or "The Infinite Staircase", and was first printed in March 1960; Escher is well-known for his drawings
11exploring optical illusions and real architectural, mathematical, and philosophical principles rendered in fantastical ways.
i'll take that as a no
FISSION MAILED
SANKE NO! YOU CANT DO THAT
w00t silverscreen =D
The projections = the agents
FotherMucker
MC.Esher must have been the best MC ever
RAIDEN, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE FUTURE!
No
11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIACEPTION: Joseph Gordon-Levitt went to his audition after a brief character summary, wearing a full suit "just in case", unknowingly matching his character's wardrobe perfectly.
Apple_Bloom: Mal = Agent Smith
And there it is.
Oh shit
MOVIE TRIVIA: They actually built the Penrose Stairs on site, rather than use CGI.
she is dead!?
8did she died?
I love this trivia
Mc Hammer is the best MC

He sure was, Uncleorange. He had phat beats and phat drawings

I thought hipster_brony's favorite drink was Ouzo.
He already knows what to put in it, so he just dreams it into being
Keep an eye out for his ring each time he comes back
Next time I'm playing a dream sequence in D&D, I'm totally casting "Sleep"

Yup

Lukem1999: i thought it was 5mins to an hour
Leo WAS shutter Island
You've got to remember that she wasn't stabby-stabby when she was alive.
Miza Cobb or Miza Jar Jar Binks?

I've been having Pony dreams for the last month or so... Lauren Faust Inception'd me
Shutter island: IM A detective. no your not. oh THE END
0He was also the main lead in 28 Days Later
Bwaaaam
this movie is about breaking monopolies
we need to go shallower
i got shot repeatedly in the neck in a car chase dream. it was weird but painless
featherwings If you search up Mal's actress on Google (Marion Cotillard), then you'll find she looks amazing. ;)
9PONICEPTION
I thought I was first
I'm back. What'd I miss?
Fuck imma facedesk soon
I've been trying to get pony dreams but have failed
this movie needs more bass
Maybe someone's invading my brain and stealing useful information from it
But then I cant know If my dream is true or a dream
FUCK
0Ehh. Well, I should go have supper and keep PMVing anyway.
Needs more dubste
BUUUUUUUR
my bowels aren't empty yet

Being inception-ed by Faust would be the greatest thing EVER!
NewDCD: Is that a pony within a pony?
0So I suppose I'll be off.
Y'all know the guy's son is Scarecrow, right?
a video within a video? MADDNESS
I think um, maybe, we shoul go a bit further, if um, that all right with you /Fluttershy
Madness?
A mask within a mask.
8cillian murphy is a very underrated actor
There needs to be an episode that is a parody of Inception in Season 2
THIS
IS
Lauren Faust as the architect.....Want
MOVIE TRIVIA: Fischer's Father is played by the hunter from Jurrassic Park 2: The Lost World. This was his final role before he died of cancer

BADUM
BADOM
silverscreen te gusta?
December
MY suitcase
NewDCD I don't think we should go down that path. XD
not best choice for a totem, farly sure all chess peices fall over when you do that.
dman?
How much longer will this movie be?
Apparently, Cillian Murphy was in Tron, too.
yes, anotherbrony?
Custom Totems.
:3
it never ends
NewDCD its only way they'll learn what it is right?
espa침ol?
I don't get why it would never topple in a dream
Well, totems still needed to be emphacized so it's not really wasted.
11RANDOM ELLEN PAGE TRIVIACEPTION: Jessy Schram, Taylor Swift and Carey Mulligan were considered for the role of Ariadne before Ellen Page accepted it.
But whatever
You only use your Totem when you wake up or are in your own dream
8o hai misterbristle
9sklar: pretty much
11Taylor Swift...
it ends when you take it out or turn it off
ewww taylor swift
Praise Nolan
anotherbrony - de lo que yo sepa, yo, (tu,) Y newdcd hablamos espanol. Y no tengo la 'enie' tengo un teclado ingles
11just...why?
You need like 3 reclaimeds if you want a good totem
Taylor Swift? whaaa.....
Sorry Taylor Swift
Thank god for the final result
Ellen Page is so intelligent yet quirky.
FlamingBooger I actually kind of like her.
I'm guessing another 30-45 minutes?
But Pinkie Pie is the cutest pony of all time
OF ALL TIME
no
I'm okay with this.
The amount of memetic jokes that we'd be making if Swift got the part...
OF ALL TIME
damn shes smart
esta bien, suele ser un problema el no tener la 침
WHAT ARE DREAMS? baby don't wake me. don't wake me. DEEPER.
Taylor Swift can play a theme song for them in the dream!
i bet it's getting worse
my totem would be a figurine of fluttershy
Apple_Bloom Not Fluttershy? D:
But Lyra is best pony
Kanye West is cuter
I am happy this movie turned out the way it did. nuff said
Ellen page is the best person ever
11RANDOM TOTEM TRIVIACEPTION: Mal's totem, a spinning top, is (probably) a reference to the Clifford D. Simak's story 'Ring Around the Sun' where the spinning top is used as a way to skip from one parallel Earth to another (by way of helping characters to concentrate).
8Apple_Bloom: nope, RD is
No one said it wasnt getting worse
Lyra is best pony for sure
DID YOU KILL HER?
Dman- no me anda el sonido de la pelicula
WHAT IS SLEEP! BABY DONT HURT ME DONT HURT ME NOMORE

TRIXIECEPTION
My favorite pony is Rainbow Dash!
sorry everyo
Hipster_Brony Well Fluttershy is the cutest
9LITTLE RICHARD
everypony*
Silly Hipster, that's not how you spell Fluttershy.
Silver isn't that some spoilers?
Ellen is best pony
Apple Bloom is the best
Little dick
8lol silver, you mean cobb?
RD wouldn't be my totem. Definitely not...
This is like Ocean's Eleven meets Nightmare on Elm Street 3
Apple Bloom is the best Pony
Imma let you finish, but Fluttershy is the cutest pony of all time!
11Hipster: Nope. The top was Mal's totem first.
How could RD be your totem
Fluttershy would definitely be my totem.
she is XD
...Inception gives you Little Richard?
spoiler?
...!
Little Richard cured himself of his bisexuality.
catholics!
Silverscreen, that's why people were saying spoilers :D
RD plushie totem = nope
UncleOrange, you are the Kanye West of bronies, and I like you for that.
specificity
specificity
lolol
Little Richard!? Ooooooooo!
SPECIFICEPTION
My totem would be Fermat's Last Theorem.
11Xiagu: Cobb said it was mal's totem if you were listening. :P
does that mean Silverscreen has to ban himself? BANCEPTION
If I can prove it, I know I'm in a dream.
you like apple bloom? silly thats not how you spell Rainbow dash
FEED HIM!
8anaconda malt liquor gives you WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I find it amusing how there's no one on the streets.

Was the first movie that short? I thought I'd have time to watch Smackdown first :(
Hows it going?

I can't believe this is actually pretty intense.
SO MANY SINKS
Rarity is delicious.
Sinkseption
CombustibleLemons: you should read the skittles story. :p
That would explain Cupcakes
that's what I was talking about
Now I wanna eat a pony...
the candy theory!
indeed I shall.
Delicious Cupcakes
that explaaaaaaaaaaaaaains everything
some hot chocolate and a couple of Rarity.
no don't eat me!
But their skulls are tougher than bone. It'll be hard to reach the cotton candy.
I don't believe that theory though (especially after reading cupcakes)
Okay, now I want to eat a Pegasus head

Seriously, don't the cut columns in the Luke/Vader battle in ESB look a bit like cigarettes?

Hah. Nolan is pretty awesome if he told Warner Brothers to take their 3D and shove it.

Uh oh. Incoming Kick...
REVEALED IN THE FIRST EXPANSION PACK OF BATTLEFIELD 3...
lol?
aaawwww wut?
wait maybe this server is a dream
They weren't expecting resistance, which is why they arent in an armored van or a tank.
TgPFluttershy: Well, the Dark Knight Rises isn't going to be in 3D, so it's looking like your wish has been granted so far.
TOO SOON... THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID
Oh look spraypainted airsoft guns
20 percent slower? LOL
Ten. Seconds. Flat. from the jump
...WILL BE THE 3 LEVELS OF INCEPTION!!!
11And I agree. It took some balls to tell a big studio company "up yours." Then again, he is their most recent cash cow, so he did have the leverage.
RanYakumo: yay :D
who did you think it was, Hipster?
lets go deeper so we have more time.
Holla holla get $
I know. I want him to keep doing it this way, RanYakumo

This part is retarded
Toooooooooooooooot.
A toot of a trumpet would sound roughly like BBBRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAHHHH three levels deep.

the music playing is still the same key/tone at all levels, but it's intermittent?

THE NEXT KICK! THE SERVER ADMINS ARE AFTER US
4So how long realistically do they have?
4Before they hit the water
delicious freefall
10 minutes
This movie is amazing
no gravity?
MAGIC
My response is to make fun of it.
like 40 minutes
Ghosties, not long enough
ghosties - 10 seconds so ....
What are you doing, Dave?
Enough time to finish the movie.
10 sec
Like, 6 seconds
How do I without gravity?
about 20 mins
about 10 seconds if it kept playing
in level 3
i love the dial tone, nice touch
Oh sure, now the furinachure decides to float.
4Oh, what about in the dream?
in that slowmo
Guys I accidentally the whole hotel
9there's something I never understood, though
I'd say less than 4 seconds in real time
Well, if it takes 4 seconds for the van to hit the water, they have about 30 minutes
HOW DO I SHOT GRAVITY
It stays put for the fight but now it all floats.
ghosties - 3 mins in level 2, 20 mins in level 3
11RANDOM ARIADNE'S HAIR TRIVIACEPTION: Ariadne's hair is in a tight bun in the hotel sequence so that the filmmakers didn't have to figure out how her hair should move in zero-gravity.
Ghosties Eh, there are some time ratios they use, but idk them.
This is the dream.
@ranyakumo entertainment is part of the media.
4Ah
2nd dream 3 min 3rd dream an hour
=]
The real question is how long do we have in this movie
guys, i accidentaly fisher
With a gravitation potion
1: a few seconds 2: a few minutes 3: 20 minutes
I accidentally gravity
3rd dream, scorchman, is 20 mins
I suppose so.
brb
with my wife
Tyranico i said this >_<
I can't believe I missed most of this movie
Just clarifying.

11LEVEL 4 LIVESx01
lol
I have a level 85 warrior

how stable is this level?
SUDDENLY, THERE WAS WATER
FINAL ROUND...
I have the movie, but I like the socal interaction
PLANET OF THE APES
level 4 aint shit
This movie now takes place on a beach inside of an army base inside of a hotel inside of a van inside of a plane.
Who else gets pissed when someone says, "Luke, I am your father"?
we'll they have been changing with each level.
And she's holding Fischer hostage in Limbo
THE TIME OF RETRIBUTION HAS COME
Mal, that is
featherwings Level 4 reminds me of Minecraft.
ROUND 1
Minecraft = Inception limbo.
silly Ariadne, swimming in your clothes
we must be done
DECCIDE THE DESTINY
very unstable
NewDCD: Until somebody makes a horrible sex joke out of it...oops too late
YOU BLEW IT ALL UP!
And in this Limbo, is this Mal's limbo?
9e'yup
Combustiblelemons INFINITELY STABLE
Shoddy architecture right there
Luke, I am your father
so would this be a wet dream?
No. It's the word that comes before Luke.
featherwings Actually, Level 4 reminds me of Wall-E.
it has been hundreds of years since they built limbo
OOOHHH
X CHICKENS, WELCOME TO DIE
DAMN YOU ALL TO HELL!
and that's why everything is falling to pieces?
Where are the cheat codes when you need them?
9no, Limbo is a shared state of all of their minds
AND THE VAN IS STIL LFALLING.
you know
* STILL FALLING
WITH THE LEMONS
It's the island from Kingdom Hearts.
Suddenly: Farlanders, thousands of them.
DAMN YOU ALL TO HELL
best slo mo shot of the decade
I just realized there's still static
beep beep beep. Nuclear Launch Detected.
9so it also includes Cobb's
what is he even trying to do
So...How much time do we got in level 4?
9and by extention, Mal's
zero gravity ftw
Destiny Island
>a literal shore
It's still alfalfing
SPAAAACE
from van to water?
LISTEN TO THE STATIC
MWAHAHAHAHA
YOU DID IT! YOU BLEW IT UP!
9because they've already been in Limbo and they share the same dream
I WANT TO SEE THEM ENTER THE DREAMS OF WHOEVER WROTE CUPCAKES
OH GOD, THEY REALLY DID IT!!
But it appears to be based off of Cobb's and Mal's dream
That's it.
But gravitation potions only last two minutes
pew pew pew
spave? spave!?! SPAAAAVE!
space lemons are good
*yawns* not because of the movie

what would they do in cupcakes?
Ha Irony!
team fortress inception by valve
That's why you just keep drinking them, UncleOrange.
nade in hand
11I heard he's REEEEAAAALLY messed up in the head.
Some day I will have to read cupcakes, it's reffrenced so much and I just dont get it.
well theres no way this could possibly fail

OMG! I was wrong. It was Earth all along.
Gods help you when you run out.
DAMN YOU ALL TO HEEEEEELLLL!!!!
FUUUUUUU
Hold X to revive you ass
themarewhoarrangestheblocks: for curiosity or to invade?
9they built a world in Limbo
SAITO I WISH I COULD QUIT YOU
GAWD
8theyre the only ones that have been there
So Limbo is shaping itself around their time in Limbo?
i wrote cupcakes
dammit Saito, there wasn't any room for tourists on this job
Wow those guys are bad shots
I want to enter the dreams of Silverscreen
INCEPTION 2 IS ACTUALLY THE mlp FIM MOVIE
infinite time
Brokeback Inception
THe future!
8everything in limbo was built by them while they were there
gabemoist 0_o

New Planet of the Apes looks good.
that would be so terrible.
9yeah, because Cobb has been in Limbo
ALL MY BITS
Ideas are really contagious

Who wrote Rocket to insanity?

Sumica: make sure you don't read it before bedtime
13ORLY
Don't read it Sumica! It's a trap.
Someone played Minecraft too long.
13YARLY
Tjeu
That explains it
13You shouldn't be using colors.
Welcome to Cobb's Minecraft server
Maybe we'll see wall-e
So, why is it decaying?

limonception

Falling apart?
0you just found a kick
autokick sure is autokick
13xD
Okay, I;m being reminded too much of minecraft
9yeah, Limbo is blank unless someone you are sharing the dream with has already been there
BOT
Damn, just one more level deeper and they'd have reached Equestria.
banhammer
They're in Lybia!
dari-bot is on top of shit
writers in this film should get fucking medals for this@
/me 11had a dream of defending Equestria against giant Lizard Men this morning.
Likewise, Silverscreen.
GGgala bth
same silverscreen
0Level 5
Equestria = Lvl 5?
but i have morbid curisody.
0Equestria
0well silver
Limbo, level n+1
The part about dreaming lightly, I mean.
8Silverscreen: wat
so
9since Cobb has been there, this Limbo is a projection of Cobb's
RobotPinkie Real question is, what comes after Equestria?
simple physics
-just came in- whats playin folks?
I like to be fully in control of my dreams
0thats quite interesting
smart!
n=constructed dreamspaces
for the scenes in the hotel
level 4.5
/me 11had a dream of defending Equestria against giant Lizard Men this morning.
when i close my eyes i somtimes see blocks
Not the part about giant lizardmen invading Equestria.
are we looking into the future?
Equestria! FRIENDSHIP!
11It was very odd.
Nothing comes after Equestria!
@Silverscreen I like that dream
I have no dreams, due mainly to having no soul
/me is envious of silverscreen
silverscreen - 09____________________-0
DEFEAT THE ARMY OF MANTIS MEN
Why did the tension get released if there was no gravity?
I'm jelly Silverscreen
RanYakumo: The moon
You should write a fic
It's the final stage of consciousness
what what we playing
what's on
I nkow what comes after Equestria. The moon.
Well then how come Twilight has a dream?
my pony dreams usually consist of pinkie throwing me a party for something
8because cobb hasn't been there in centuries of limbo time
Dream preview of Season 2.
what kind of TROLL PHYSICS CAN we come up from this movie
anypony else find an odd sense of irony that we're all lovers of a show with super colorful equines and yet when we try to have color here in a chat for a get together of said fans we get banned?
/me thinks that Silverscreen's dreams are sexy.
is this Inceptionor that Tomatoes movie?
Silverscreen: 6_9
what a piece of crap
HE IS DESCRIBING MINECRAFT
/me 0had a dream of silver having a dream of defending equestria from giant lizard men this morning
Can they shape limbo since there aren't prjections
MirrorImage AFter the moon comes Mars.
Ohhh, so that's why it's falling apart. No one's been there to take care of it
Is that lizardmen as in humanoid lizards, or lizardmen as in Lizardman from Soul Calibur?
This is Inception
not terribly, CircuitMane
techdude3000 yup
9pretty much
OMG! The Quill and Sofa Shop! What have they done to it?!
Because an army of the latter would be pretty cool.
CQC
one time i had a dream i was playing world of warcraft and then we came to a boss and the only way to beat him was to have sex
screw the real world
/me used to dream within his dreams all the time when he was little
COMMANDO
Double kill!
Somewhere in limbo, there is a giant statue of Derpy
11The only thing I really remember is me Rarity, and Rainbow Dash being attacked by a bunch of these lizard creatures.
he is such a good shot
Dem stormtroopers.
9bloody good movie eh? That's why my expectation of Rises are good
I call hax
+50
Killtastic!!!
I fucking never remember my dreams
"Unfortunately Notch hadn't implemented the building materials we needed, but we made do with what we had"
You see, when Celestia banned Luna, she really just sent her sister deeper.
It's certainly entertaining
gggala: Oh okay, maybe it's my crazy pony mind
silverscren: I never get rarity in mine D:
/me woke up from a dream within a dream. Realized he was trapped in the level 1, panicked
somewhere
they need more c4
lol
lol sotha
I had this dream that I was attacking Equestria with an army of giant lizard men this morning.
11I was kicking ass until one of them grabbed me.
9the only pony-related dreams I've had are pony-merchandise-related
I had a dream once where I flew with rainbow dash, then got friendly air tackled by her
i only remember the incredibly epic images
Saito is old school. He doesn't have regenerating health
I don't know if Attack of the Killer Tomatoes will be a good way to end this BMN
It was nice.
sotha IT MAKES SENSE
C4 up in this bitch.
DO IT WITH MAGIC
Stabbercube I distinctly remember my best dreams. Such as when I invaded Venezuela and won in time for my cousin and some internet guy to get married.
I've had pony dreams before
so the lesson of Inception is: If you're not sure whether or not you're dreaming, shoot yourself in the head
Pony merch NewDCD?
/me 8had a dream once where he was defending Equestria from 4chan trolls
With self-inserts
I had a Derpy dream.
I just can't see it ending this BMN better than this
Samus just took her clothes off.
Did you die?
inb4 last-minute exposition
That's what I did :D
I've started dreaming of ponies every other night.... is something wrong with me?
9It was bloody crazy
sure it was a dream hipster?
We still did not pass the magic 200 :(
Look knife fight
That's Wario, Snake.
so if you dreamed of ponies your MIND SECURITY would be the EQUESTRIAN GUARD?
11Hipster_Brony: was that Equestria or Ponychan? :P
the horror!!!!
something you should know about inception- they really only use heroin
Hipster_Brony: Pics or it didn't happen
what is dream, what is reality? Is that the question that many people shall ask themselves tonight?
/me has not once had a Pony dream yet, and still remembers one or two dreams very well every morning. mind Y U NO
8it was equestria
I had a dream where Twilight was supplying a castle seige
KILLIMANJARO!!! I'M BATMAN!!!
My best dream was defending Japan from North Koreans and CHinese
DSNesmith1: lol
shoot her!
hipster_brony: Please tell me you had a grenade launcher or something that went boom
0man
You're late for dinner Cobbs.
the horror!!!!
has anyone else ever noticed that Cobb says "There's only one thing you need to know about me" like, five times in this movie?
Hi Mal...
I never dream
i had a dream that i was vigorously masturbating then when i woke up i was vigorously masturbating
I found that I have nightmares consistently if I fall asleep to classical music.
sucks
never looked back

0I still have yet to visit Equestria in lucid dreams ;_;

WHY MUST THINGS GO BOOM!?
dreams upon dreams are being destory

11RANDOM MOVIE EXPLINATION: The goal was to convince Fishcher that his father was dissapointed in fischer for trying to follow in his footsteps. This would convince Fischer that his father wanted Fischer to find his own way in the world.
combo kick time
whooosh
........ho-ly shit

Ride that Kick!
naw,

IN BEFORE MASSIVE MIND FUCKERY ENSUES (anyone want the explanation for how the levels work after this?)
4But, in reality, his dad really was disappointed in him
How is it they're suddenly able to kill themselves and go UP a layer, without being stuck in limbo?
Kick complete

I think I should be able to ;)
FUCKFUCKFUCKFUCK

That's one dream I'd remember when I wake up.
Hi_brony_what_is_up

THE DROP
THE KICK
They didin't die
9KICKCEPTION
they just fell
MOD FIGHT
I WISH MY CAPS LOCK WORKED
lol
brb I have to clean up
I'd love to, but I don't have the digital box in my room, so I don't always have it. Since Hub is digital-only and TW requires that you lease digital decoding equipment from them.
@Ghosties: Yeah, their fictional reality is actually better than reality
INERTIA
....I jelly
6inb4 ending complaints
meanwhile in lvl 1 cobb is drownind
she's still ALIVE?
ohmycapslockworks
11NightFurson: It's because the kick was synched together, allowing them to rid up all at once.
FALCON KIACK
Oh god! HANDS!
get out of there
but Sathi, it's really late for you no?
hipster_brony wat
i lied
hahahahaha
they actually repair his relationship with his father even though the man was a dick
actually, BOTH of them still are?
4So was this all an elaborate plot to get him to have a positive memory of his father?
yes it is
yes
4What's the payoff?
you should probably stream Euroshows instead
yes
Yes.
inertia is a property of matter
yep
sweet mother of fuck i just epic-gasm'd
4What do they get?
Ariadne should've got a headshot
More Beer? WHAT FOR?!
8ghosties: you'll see
Ghosties nothing is true, everything is permitted
so they can plant an idea into his brain
IlOvEmYsHiFtBuTtOn
DSNessmith1 See, we don't really know all that much about what the guy actually felt about his son.
to make him break up his father's company
@ghosties the son disbands his father's company.
So for realz, how much longer is this movie?
ghosties - the positive memory was the plot - to get him to break up his company
Fischer would split up the energy conglomerate
LEVERAGE
to ruin the company
Ghosties: They get popcorn
Ghosties: They get him to break up his father's company
hipster_brony youare the best
Ghosties Kinda, but not exactly.
I'll get to training you to stream on monday
Hold on Ghosties
this was all laid out way back at the start
THATS WHAT THEY GET
they get to be in the movie
REMEMBER COBOL
so that hes convinced his father wants him to break up the company and not be like him
We're at the ending bit.
was it worth it? nope it was cool though
ghosties - so the other guy can become rich
Yep. Popcorn
Just a little more.
Remember the deal they made with Saito at the beginning?
THEY STILL MAD
Ghosties THIS RIDE AINT OVER YET
great, looking forward to it
Were at the end?
OH NOEZ SINKING VAN
MEOW!
THIS WAS A BAD IDEA
watch this guys
scenes like THIS is why Nolan should have been nominated for best director
11Ghosties: The payoff is that Fischer will liquidate his father's company and rebuild it for himself, preventing the company from becoming an international superpower.
alost\
DAMN YOU COBOL INDUSTRIES!!
4No, because I wasn't really around for the beginning
Cobb drowns in the van
almost
FUCK MY COMP
the end
pixelated!
yeah the endings like whaaaaaat
FUCKMYKEYBOARD
TAKES !) SEC FOR ! SEC TO GO DOWN ON THE AD
cobb's dies alone
HEY DAWG, I HEARD YOU LIKED WATERBOARDING, SO WE PUT WATERBOARDING IN YOUR VAN
meow meow meow
fuck
...how do they get out of this layer, again? chill for a week?
10* 1*
oxoGEN
4Does this all mean that FISCHER'S COMPANY DOESN'T BECOME SUPER BAD BOSS OF THE WORLD or some shit?
lossthief He'll probably get nominated for The Dark Knight Returns.
Ghosties, yeah
Yup
YES GHOSTIES
What Silverscreen said. Also Saito agreed to pull some strings so that Cobb can see his kids again.
Ghosties Keep on listening.
4....Wow
But pretty much yes.
4Eh
NewDCD do you play AC
U no need to breathe?
Ghosties - fischer's company was rival to another. ANOTHER will now becume super baws
4Okay film
And they all get paid
0the neding will be confusing
11Ghosties: Yes, and that means that Saito's company gets to stay in business as well.
Y U NO SAVE LEO?
Just keep swimmin', just keep swimmin'..
0ending*
it worked
This is layer 1.
One might say the bass was kicking in this movie.
9sklar: AssaCreed? Or Armored Core?
it's not really about Fischer? He's a living MacGuffun
So Cobol industries is no longer a superpower and Saito wins.
Y U NO GIVE ME OXYGEN?
ARMORED COAR
ASSBRO
ASScreed
ASSCREED?
Armored Core FTW!
11FritztheCat: exactly.
secret buttception
ASS
creed
ranyakumo I doubt it, he's made great movie after great movie, and hasn't been nominated. he ticked off somebody at the academy
4Is there gonna be a sequel?
Cobb's still in Level 4
Annnd we come full circle.
god i hope not
ghosties - none planned or wanted. they want this to be original on its own
Ghosties: I don't think so
theres supposed to be a video game not based on the actual events of this movie though
Cobb is in Limbo now.
How shit son
9MOVIECEPTION
11And we return to the beginning.
So much pixelation!
full circle
I don't see room or reason for a sequel
what
circle of life
now, back to where we started
Holla holla get dolla
and back to the begining
0dat opening sequence
its not about the companies its about cobb
loosthief Well, what do those idiots at the Academy know anyway? :P
BEGINNING OF MOVIE
Level 4? Shit, he's only half way through the game.
Cobol isn't Fischer's company is it?
those restarts were the movie
there better not be a sequel
EVER
NewDCD yes or do you play assassiaans creed
QUICK
I sequel would only "piss off certain people"
Yo Cobb, we heard you like dreaming, so we put a dream in your dream in your dream so that you can dream while you dream while you dream. Cobb: We need to go deeper. Yo Dawg Guy: BITCH PLEASE!
ARE WE WATCHING THE MOVIE AGAIN?
LOOP THE MOVIE
we were going to the end not starting over
Ghosties = Probably not. The story is complete
ASS'S CREED!!!!
So this is level 0?
Who's the old geezer?
Spoiler : Cobb takes a warp star back to level 1
And then Saito was old.
The whole movie was a flashback?!!
0so yeah
0it was
JUst watch it
Broseph yahtzee
FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Old man is explained in 3...
levels explanation: cobb bleeds out in limbo, rises up to level one because levels 2 and 3 have ceased to exist, then drowns int he van and gets sent down to limbo. THis creates the huge age difference between him and Saito at the end. They shoot each other, rising back up past the now-non-existant first level into reality (the plane), and the ending ensues.
I believe the whole movie is a dream~
2...
9A FLASHBACK WITHIN A FLASHBACK
ghosties for the love of god i hope not
1...
yes flashback
FritzTheCat A very short term flashback, but yes.

Oh wait, thats...INCEP--

11Now...this next part is the only part I don't understand...just watch.
Anon, he's like ancient now.
CALLBACK
Yes

a montage within a flashback within a dream within a fantasy within an idea within a thought within a picture about a dream
CAPSLOOCK ITS CRUISECONTROL FOR COOLNESS
I think I get it
man he doesn't even look asian
But NewDCD yes or no
I mean shit, he's got the whole frickin' cyber tower left, for one.
back to reality
He's spent decades and decades in Limbo
is this real?
Was that a Sig I saw?
0and now, the ending
BROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
4What
CAPSLOCK FOR 20% COOOOOOOOOLER!
Silverscreen Then you understand it perfectly
Annnd WAKE UP
alternatively, it's ALL A DREAM

4IT'S STILL A DREAM
/me says to the audience, "So, now you must decide for yourself. Is this a dream, is this real life? But the real question is, Was it ever real to start? This is the question that defines the world...you decide."
G E N I U S!
IT DOESNT STOP
According to Michael Caine, any scene he's in is the Real World. I tend to accept that interpretation. Also, you can hear and see the totem wobbling.

okay i can explain this
TOOOOO MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
9Okay guys, according to Alfred, in the original cut, it fell. BUT, they decided it'd be more fun to leave it open to interpretation. Canonically, it DID fall though.
