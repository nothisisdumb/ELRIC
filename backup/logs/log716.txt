<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/L1IkPl4RGhM

<alexxm> TheRandomkid321 from what i understand it's more a demon
<Gold_Demona> TheRandomkid321: This is anime. Talking cats should not be surprising. Especially in Magical Girl anime
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: it's called Kyuubey btw
<TheRandomkid321> The only anime I like is anything with zombies.
<DeadpoolDash> My favorite anime is Cowboy Bebop and Black Lagoon

<CrimsonPhoenix> Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask is gorgeous in the 3ds
<CrimsonPhoenix> dem anime cutscenes in 3d
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: the manga is slightly (VERY slightly) different and there's a ton of spinoffs
<MadSurge> HMMMM, magic or miracles you say?

<Mutterguy> oh wow. that's dark
<Sumica> 00,10every one loves mustard gas

<Phase4> XD
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, .-.
<AdamTheDuck> 80?
<Phase4> TheRandomkid321, my server isnt going to be reliable and may disapear at any time
<AdamTheDuck> Damn...
<TheRandomkid321> Phase4 Do you let just anyone go on it or only me and a few others?
<Phase4> i've given someone else the address
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: maybe you should clean up your cookies/temporary internet files
<TheRandomkid321> Phase4 Will it come back if it does dissapear?
<Phase4> maybe, maybe not
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: On BOTH computers?
<Mutterguy> i got admit i've bben spending a lot of time on the tekkify server
<TheRandomkid321> Ah okay.
<Phase4> either way i can send you the save if you want
<Gold_Demona> All other websites work fine, just not DeviantArt. D:
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I dunno then
<TheRandomkid321> Give me the adress to it then... Despite the fact that I once had it without your permission :$
<Mutterguy> East coast server?
<Mutterguy> that appiles to Gold_Demona and MadSurge. I know Phase4 has an east coast server so to speak
<TheRandomkid321> I live on the east coast :D
<Gold_Demona> Mutterguy: Hell if I know. I don't know where DeviantArt is based
<Mutterguy> me too
<Phase4> Mutterguy, ?
<Mutterguy> or an east coast
<Phase4> i think its in la, so wherever that is
<TheRandomkid321> Phase4 Message it to me mate.
<Gold_Demona> Phase4: LA as in Los Angeles? That's in California. That's west coast

<Mutterguy> Yer, it'd be a shame if someone's heart was to break....
<Jmo> Have you tried resetting your connection? Restarting your router/modem? Your computer?
<Jmo> <_<
<Gold_Demona> But everything else is fine... It's just DeviantArt that's broken
*Mutterguy aims a rubber lead pipe at Jmo's heart
<Gold_Demona> On BOTH computers
<Ponies47> Who be streaming? O.O
<Jmo> Both?
<Jmo> o.O
<TheRandomkid321> I still don't know what type of PC to get for my new laptop. Something that can handle Day Z. Peferably desiged for gaming.
<Jmo> Strange
<MadSurge> Ponies47: Sumi is
<Gold_Demona> Jmo: I have two computers. A mac and a pc.
<Gold_Demona> I use both
<AdamTheDuck> and a late greetings to you Ponies47
<Gold_Demona> My internet connection is fine, otherwise I wouldn't be in chat and stream. Stream isn't lagging at all.
<Sumica> 00,10ohhi Ponies47
<MadSurge> Mmm beansauce cookies
*Ponies47 Waves at Sumica "Hello. What's up?" :3
<Dumori> yay i didn't crash anyting
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, Day Z \:3/
<Dumori> ^ pro prgramming skills
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck Hey i'm a sucker for zahmbehz ^_^ and my current Macbook is LITERALLY falling apart.
<TheRandomkid321> so is that cat thingy good or evil?
<AdamTheDuck> I have no idea as I came in half way through the episode and the stream keeps buffering for me to see the action XD
<AdamTheDuck> to see any action*
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck I take it you play Day Z?
<MadSurge> TheRandomkid321: keep watching, next episode should answer that
<TheRandomkid321> MadSurge it's evil isn't it? WHya re the cute things always evil?
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, what fun would reading the Zombie Survival guide be without being able to see it in action? \:3/
<MadSurge> And cute art :D
<AdamTheDuck> D'awwwwwww
<AdamTheDuck> Buffered just at the right time
<AdamTheDuck> You have a Steam account TheRandomkid321? :3
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck I know but... Doesn't taht game just activate every survival instinc in your body? I've heard it does that and makes you really paranoid if you play it for long periods of time. Especially when it's dark. But hell taht's why I want it so badly. And why I NEED a PC.
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDUck Yeah.
<TheRandomkid321> That cat thingy enver blinks does it?
<MadSurge> TheRandomkid321: nope
<AdamTheDuck> Blinking is for the weak
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Nightly Roundup #484
<Mutterguy> that's not a cat. it's a just a thingy. I bet it's a witch
<MadSurge> Don't have a staring contest with Kyuubei
<Ponies47> Pffft. Blinking
<AdamTheDuck> https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-DlvhENDYV5M/UCV5oOAQzeI/AAAAAAAACPQ/-x_SpidypQA/s1600/TheStarecolored.png
<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: so intense :)
<TheRandomkid321> Apparently day Z will be released as a game. Not a free mod.
<Ponies47> AdamTheDuck: Dat Fluttershy
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, eeyup \:3/
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck But wouldn't taht make everyone with the mod want to buy the game?
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, add meh, Adam The Duck on Steam
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDUck You add me. I have no intent to bother opening steam right now. it's TheRandomkid321.
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, I guess, I mean that's how many of my favourite games start out, as simple humble mods.
<Sumica> 00,10／人﻿ ◕ ‿‿ ◕ 人＼
<AdamTheDuck> ^ \:3/
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck I hardly think of Day Z as a mod anymore. It's such a great mod and has caused such great things.
<Gold_Demona> dat ddr
<MadSurge> Dat DDR
<Sumica> 00,10would you like to make a contract?
<MadSurge> ^
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Nightmare Night 2012: Fanfiction Contest Winners and Entrants!
<AdamTheDuck> OMG
<AdamTheDuck> Pocky!
<AdamTheDuck> I remember those
<TheRandomkid321> POCKEEEY!
<MadSurge> Mmm candy
<Sumica> 00,10they sell that at the local walmart
<TheRandomkid321> Ohh a peice of cany
<TheRandomkid321> *candy
<TheRandomkid321> SO AdamTheDuck. Is the Day Z world as massive as they say it is?
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, it's ArmA, of course it's huge.
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck So withput a vehicle it takes ages to navigate? And with a vehicle you become a target for bandits?
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, going on by foot is fun anyway :3
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck Until you die from hinger/thirst.
<Sumica> 00,10is this dark and grim, yep
<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: if only humans weren't allowed to shoot each other :|
<Sumica> 00,10but it gets more
<Gold_Demona> Sumica: WalMart only sells the basic chocolate and strawberry... But it's better than no pocker at all I guess.
<MadSurge> Sumica: sshhhh!!!
<Gold_Demona> pocky*
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, pfft, there's drinks and water bottles everywhere, and once you find a box of matches, an axe and a hunting knife, you can basically live off the land
<Gold_Demona> AdamTheDuck: Mmm, squirrel.
<TheRandomkid321> Apparently there are tents in the game too. What do they even do for you? Sorry i'm asking all these questions :$
<Sumica> 00,10beter yet, become zombie. Then live off those liveing off the land
<MadSurge> Sumica: braaiiiiiinnssss
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Gold_Demona> Don't come to Florida then. You won't find any brains here.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: ok :D
<AdamTheDuck> MadSurge, that's another thing that sort of bugs me, no one can be trusted which I don't think would really happen if a real zombie apocalypse were to occur >.>
<Sumica> 00,10reminds me of the wow zombie event
<Sumica> 00,10I went full gunnut
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, store items
<AdamTheDuck> but anyone can take the items
<Sumica> 00,10camped out on a guard tower on my hunter with my wolfslayers rifle
<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: yeah, that's the thing! I know there would be lots of bandits and assassins, but as much as I know no other player can be trusted on that mod
<AdamTheDuck> Or do what they do in the Walking Dead. Safety zombeh \:3/
<Sumica> 00,10tie a zombie up outside your tent as a guarddog?
<AdamTheDuck> Nah just cut a zombie's limbs and lower jaw and tie it to your back so you smell like the other zombies
<Mutterguy> Sumica before Lich king? that was FUN
<Sumica> 00,10yeah
<MadSurge> He went up and gone!
<Sumica> 00,10till the greafing and exploiting that is
<Serenity> Hey everypony
<Ponies47> Hey Serenity

<Ponies47> Yay Steam finshed downloading L4D2, now I have another game to waste my life with :P
<Kencolt> And this show is?

<Sumica> 00,10this is madoka
<Kandarihu> Ooh, I'm coming back to Madoka Magica!
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: yep
<Kandarihu> I recognize this instantly

<Kandarihu> Homura
<MadSurge> SURPRISE
<alexxm> so the crystals keep them alive?
<Sumica> 00,10the crystal is them
<MadSurge> Congratulation girls, you're all leeches!
<Sumica> 00,10the body is just a shell
<Kandarihu> Liches
<MadSurge> ^
<Sumica> 00,10so yes, he is evil. in a way
<MadSurge> Clean and efficient~ :3
<Sumica> 00,10／人﻿ ◕ ‿‿ ◕ 人＼ so would you like to make a contract now?
<Kencolt> Cutest Asshole Ever.
<TheRandomkid321> SO IT IS EVIL!
<MadSurge> In a way
<p4ngya> did we ever find out what that spear lady wished for
<MadSurge> p4ngya: yes
<TheRandomkid321> But he doesnt ean harm. He just doesnt understand humans.
<Kandarihu> Well, Kyuubey is evil. Not out of malice, but indifference.
<MadSurge> And I repeat, IT GETS BETTER
<Sumica> 00,10he's more brutaly logical
<JRP2234> mica james rolfe has ponys on is youtube background
<Sumica> 00,10so
<TheRandomkid321> JRP :D
<JRP2234> i like eeeeeeeeeeee
<Sumica> 00,10dont even know who it is
<JRP2234> ^^^^
<TheRandomkid321> Sumica 0_0
<JRP2234> YOU dont know
<AdamTheDuck> Mica James Rofle? .-.
<MadSurge> Sumica: the angry videogame nerd
<Sumica> 00,10who/
<MadSurge> :D
<Squallken> morning
<AdamTheDuck> Mornin' Squallken
<Sumica> 00,10dont realy give much of a damn for internet personalitys
<alexxm> how've you been Squallken
<Kencolt> Why do these girls have a sixten old rack and an eight year old face? It's kind of disturbing.
<Squallken> ok
<Squallken> happy halloween (or NightMare Night)
<Kandarihu> p4ngya, I think this is going to be the episode where we found out what Sakura Kyouko wished for.
<TheRandomkid321> Kencolt leave it to a 50 year old to point that out XD
<AdamTheDuck> Kencolt... Welcome to... Japan? .-.
<Sumica> 00,10Clealy Kencolt has not checked out young girls
<Sumica> 00,10this is infact comon to the point of being desterbing now a days
<Kencolt> Sumica: I have checked out kore girls than you ever dreamed-- but even following anime almost from it's inception, this is a bit wierd in artstyle.
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> Sumica: its all the hormones in milk now adays, conpiracykeanu.jpg
<Kandarihu> Kencolt, they actually are about 16 years old, and the large-eye/small-mouth art style is meant to allow the eyes to be more emotionally expressive.
<AdamTheDuck> Eyes can display a lot of emotion
<Sumica> 00,10both my nieces 12 and 8 have already developed.
<AdamTheDuck> 8? .-.
<Sumica> 00,10yes
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> girls develop earlier then boys
<TheRandomkid321> That thing is evil but a sort of good evil in my eyes. Not evil or cruel just... doesn't really understand... I'm wrong arn't I?
<Dumori> Lass in my old class was developed by 11 with a rather large set of breast
<Sumica> 00,10evil by human terms yes
<Sumica> 00,10hmmmm btw any one know the rule of 4 in japan?
<Kencolt> Not normally to THAT extent. And what I'm saying is, the figures are more along the lines of Sailor Moon, or Evangelion, wher ethe faces more suggest Nanoha or Sakura. Kind of jarring.
<Ponies47> Nope
<AdamTheDuck> Japan has their own set of rules? :$
<Sumica> 00,10more of a stigma then a hard rule
<Sumica> 00,10but the number 4 is bad
<Kandarihu> The characters were designed by the person behind Hidamari Sketch, which is why their heads are wider than they are tall.
<MadSurge> Sumica: much like 13 in america
<Squallken> i heard this anime had mind blowing weirdness to it, or is mind blowing weirdness and understatment?
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> Sumica: like how 13 is bad in most western countrys right
<Squallken> an*
<Sumica> 00,10in a way yes
<Sumica> 00,104 is death
<MadSurge> Squallken: You have no idea
<Sumica> 00,10where is 13 is bad luck
<Kandarihu> Squallken, I'd say Mind Blowing Weirdness pretty much sums it up, perhaps.
<AdamTheDuck> Oooooh yeah, and something with 7 iirc.
<AdamTheDuck> I think my teacher said 7 was sickness
<AdamTheDuck> It's been too long since I did Jap ;~;
<MadSurge> Sumica: Death in the new Castlevania games always has 4444 HP :D
<Kandarihu> Some viewers had troube understanding the ending, but I was able to follow it.
<Sumica> 00,10and yeah red's back story time
<Kandarihu> trouble
<Kandarihu> Kyouko
<AdamTheDuck> 4 in Japanese is pronounced "Shi"
<AdamTheDuck> And "shi" in Japanese means death.
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> Sumica: isn't there also something about the number 9 also? in japan
<Sumica> 00,10could be
<AdamTheDuck> SpeccyRush|Drawing, isn't it 7?
<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: and the spirits of death are called shinigami :D
<Sumica> 00,10aces and 8's are also bad in western
<Kandarihu> Although, there's another pronounciation of 4: yon
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> 7 is lucky in the west AdamTheDuck but i'm talking about 9 in the east
<Sumica> 00,10she mad
<MadSurge> Sumica: except the ace of spades because it's badass :D
<TheRandomkid321> ITS POISON!
<MadSurge> APPLES ARE RUBBISH
<Sumica> 00,10aces and 8's are the deadmans hand
<AdamTheDuck> SpeccyRush|Drawing, yeah, 7 in Japanese had 2 pronounciations though
<Kandarihu> TheRandomkid321, the apple was stolen, and Sayaka didn't want to eat stolen food.
<MadSurge> The redhead is Applejack
<Kencolt> Sumica: Ah, thye Dead Man's Hand. That's a poker term relatedto a specific historical event, not quite the same thing.
<Sumica> 00,10yep
<AdamTheDuck> SpeccyRush|Drawing, so if it follows the same idea as 4, it has a negative meaning as well.
<TheRandomkid321> Kandarihu But I love thieves. Depending on their morals. Sometimes things considered wrong in society in my eyes are correct.
<Sumica> 00,10creepy flashbakc animation
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<AdamTheDuck> Loving this animation though
<MadSurge> ^
<Gold_Demona> Ok, I canNOT be the only one unable to access this site. It just doesn't make any sense.
<AdamTheDuck> Reminds me of the cutscenes from American McGee's Alice
<Serenity> I'm back with an English Breakfast
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> AdamTheDuck: the number 9 in japan sounds similar to the word for pain or distress
<Serenity> No bacon though, bleh
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: maybe it's a zone problem
<Gold_Demona> I'm done with my picture, but I can't post it! T^T
<Jmo> ;_______;
<Serenity> I had to chisel into the tin, but didn't take 20 minutes
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: maybe you can ask someone to access your account and post it
<Serenity> Only ended up cutting my hand twice
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Hell no.
<AdamTheDuck> MadSurge, :/ that's sound like a bad idea considering this is the internet.
<AdamTheDuck> that*
<Sumica> 00,10so yeah her dad burned down the church and every one in it
<Gold_Demona> Nothing against the friends I make on the internet, but I trust nobody with my personal account info
<MadSurge> I know, but not even close friends?
<Gold_Demona> Nobody
<Gold_Demona> Not even my BFF in real life
<MadSurge> Tbh yeah, me too
<Gold_Demona> Only person I trust with that info is my husband.
<Sumica> 00,10give it a few hours Gold_Demona
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: aww
<Gold_Demona> And the same vice versa
<MadSurge> You really are a model couple :3c
<TheRandomkid321> Well I gotta go to bed. Cya guys.

<Serenity> Damn
<doughnutjoe> hey there
<Gold_Demona> I crunch angrily at you
<Serenity> That is some verocous eating
<doughnutjoe> Why are you guys here
<Kandarihu> She almost crushed that apple with her bare hands, but not wanting to waste food, she ate it instead.
<Kencolt> Sumica: I'm jealous. After I get my dentures, I won't be able to eat an apple like that.
<Sumica> 00,10it's never explained why she is always eating
<doughnutjoe> your supposed tobe trick or treating
<Serenity> Sumica: cus she faet
<AdamTheDuck> doughnutjoe, we don't do that in Australia :P
<Gold_Demona> doughnutjoe: It's 8 am here. No tricks or treats yet. :P
<doughnutjoe> AdamTheDuck aww why?
<Serenity> I'm 15, not the age for that
<MadSurge> Sumica: long starving children will eat a lot afterwards

<doughnutjoe> Gold_Demona :(
<Serenity> You dont get cake in T&t!
<MadSurge> "Oh by the way, you know that boy you gave your soul for? I wanna date him"
<Serenity> Why would I freeload, to NOT get cake!
<Gold_Demona> The closest thing to it is I buy candy to hand out to trick or treaters. :P
<Sumica> 00,10time for a soul crusher
<Gold_Demona> Kids have to get the candy from somewhere
<doughnutjoe> Gold_Demona scare them
<Gold_Demona> doughnutjoe: I'm not scary enough. :P
<doughnutjoe> lol
<Gold_Demona> doughnutjoe: I'm about as scary as a potted plant
<Serenity> Anyone know the upper monster from Cry of Fear?
<Sumica> 00,10they boy she gave up her soul and wish for might be taken away by another girl
<Kencolt> That remind me.. have to pick up a bag of candy before this evening.

<Kencolt> Gold_Demona: I HATE YOU.
<Sumica> 00,10makes a few bits even more creepy then
<Jmo> my..god
<Gold_Demona> Kencolt: Awww why? :<
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: *standing ovation*
<Sumica> 00,10buhahahaha
<Kencolt> Gold_Demona: FOR THE SAKE OF THE RIGHTEOUS AND HOLY!
<Gold_Demona> Ish Sailor Minmus :>
<Serenity> Phase4: Then that classes as spawnkill?
<Sumica> 00,10chibi mun
<Phase4> XD
<alexxm> so many stalkers
<MadSurge> Gotta cook some minestrone guys, enjoy this episode without me
<Gold_Demona> I figured Chibi Moon worked for Minmus. :D
<Serenity> Hmm, not sure what to play
<Kandarihu> MadSurge, I don't think comparing Kyouko to Applejack fits. Maybe Pinkamena
<Serenity> I've got this wierd lump on the back of my neck. It's been there months.
<Sumica> 00,10Homura cares alot for madoka
<Phase4> Flashbang
<alexxm> grenade?
<Sumica> 00,10and then a hint at her power
<Kencolt> Ah, the senstitive male.
<Kandarihu> Yeah, she just killed a couple of pimps
<Squallken> so in this anime Magic Girls become Witchs sooner or later?
<Squallken> its what i think is going on
<Sumica> 00,10dead
<Kandarihu> Squallken, that will be explained at the end
<alexxm> ded
<Squallken> HOLY CRAP What i miss
<Sumica> 00,10Houmra just gunned down the cat thing
<Kandarihu> Squallken, Homura filled Kyuubey full of holes
<Squallken> damn wth is going?
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> he'll walk it off that cat thing
<Gold_Demona> Did... did he just eat himself?
<alexxm> so the pussy ate itself
<Squallken> idk what going on (crying)
<Sumica> 00,10something every guy would try
<Gold_Demona> dem pringles
<Squallken> ive never seen this anime
*Gold_Demona wants Pringles now
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> inb4 duckface pringles
<Gold_Demona> Me neither Squallken
<Sumica> 00,10she became a witch
<alexxm> what a twist
<Squallken> god damn i was right
<Sumica> 00,10good catch
<Kandarihu> NOW, Kyuubey is a villain
<XAX> Wow. American Psycho.
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> this is me so far http://i.imgur.com/WPN1c.jpg
<XAX> What a movie.
<Jmo> Kiwi
<Sumica> 00,10so keep going?
<Jmo> Don't make me chase you with a chainsaw.
<Jmo> in rnuners.
<Jmo> runners*
<Sumica> 00,10would like to get to where houmra takes a level in badass
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> Sumica: will chast minds be able to take whats to come?
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> *chats
<Kencolt> Well I have to shop for candy and sausage. (That sounded funny.) Anyhow, laters.
<Kandarihu> Two more episodes, and it'll be the last episode before the Sendai Earthquake
*Kencolt waves.
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> cya Kencolt
<alexxm> bye Kencolt
<Gold_Demona> This series feels like someone took a Clamp manga and took it in a REALLY dark direction.
<alexxm> did they forget the witch is still out there
<Sumica> 00,10and then he explaines why
<shana> hm how far into the season is this episode
<Sumica> 00,109 of 13
<shana> thanks
<Kandarihu> Oh, all of those chairs supposedly evokes another series called Bokurano which is also about a group of children getting a horrible raw deal.
<Kandarihu> Bah, I phrased it wrong.
<Squallken> so the alien cat is saying, human = food?
<Sumica> 00,10human = energy
<Roseluck`> back in my day we played battle field 1942, on a real battlefield
<Sumica> 00,10to fuel the uneverse
<Squallken> "Oh, that is despicable. (lol) I LOVE IT"
<Paspiedreamcast> just experimenting with the livestream. It appears the different theaters are only to reduce stress on the server and that the chatrooms are virtually identical
<Gold_Demona> Paspiedreamcast: indeed
<Paspiedreamcast> so I can log this channel off now and use my Paspie user exclusively
<MadSurge> Sumica: That. That is the plot twist that got me the most
<Squallken> I have an idea there this is going, and im going to love it :D
<Sumica> 00,10you could have also asked
<Squallken> i get that feeling
<shana> she eats a lot :/
<Kandarihu> Kyouko gave Madoka a snack that she actually paid for figuring that Madoka would have the same aversion to stolen food.
<MadSurge> Never tell lies, only half truths
<Squallken> but half truths are worse than lies
<Jmo> D:
<gold_demona_> My mac just exploded. o_o
<Jmo> <.<
<Jmo> Defnie 'exploded'
<Jmo> Define*
<Roseluck`> im sorry to hear that Gold_Demona
<Roseluck`> *exploded
<Roseluck`> *define
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: O_o
<Roseluck`> also, meow
<gold_demona_> Jmo: Suddenly white screen of not responding.
<Jmo> D:
<Roseluck`> white screen of death?
<Roseluck`> because apple just has to be different
<Sumica> 00,10cool boss zone
<gold_demona_> It's not like the blue screen of death because there's no text or anything. Just a big blank white screen.
<Kandarihu> This series was described as being to Magical Girl series what Evangelion is to Super Robot series. I'd say this series does a better job of deconstructing it's respective genre than Evangelion did.
<MadSurge> ^
<Roseluck`> so, gold_demona_, its 'the white screen of should have bought a PC'?
<alexxm> Kandarihu how would you say that
<Sumica> 00,10well this show did't run out of vudget in the end either
<gold_demona_> Roseluck`: I have a pc, thank you very much
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: a better deconstruction of that genre is Bokurano. Same writer, incidentally
<gold_demona_> Roseluck`: And in the four years I've had both of these computers, this is the ONLY time the mac has done this.
<Kandarihu> The deconstructive part of Evangelion centered around pretty much the only protagonist of ANY mecha series who didn't want to pilot the mecha (yes, I know it's a cyborg kaiju).
<gold_demona_> Whereas I've had to replace Windows on this PC more than once.
<MadSurge> gold_demona_: so did you follow the space plot twist?
<Sumica> 00,10wtfboooooom
<gold_demona_> What space plot twist? The one where the cat's an alien and the Magical Girls are a plot to fuel the universe?
<Roseluck`> bounce like my checks did, back in the day
<MadSurge> And yeah, they're both dead
<MadSurge> gold_demona_: yep
<Kandarihu> And this protagnoist just rubbed fans all kinds of bad ways with his spinelessness. Madoka, on the other hand, wants to become a magical girl but is stopped by someone who cares about her long enough for the details to give her pause
<gold_demona_> MadSurge: Yup, I got it. :P
<alexxm> have to go to shops back soon
<gold_demona_> Yeah, I'd have to say Madoka is a WAY better protagonist than Shinji.
<MadSurge> ^
<Roseluck`> isnt she though?
<gold_demona_> Though that's not a difficult feat. Being a better protagonist than Shinji
<Roseluck`> just saying
<Kandarihu> This is gonna be a bit hard to follow.
<MadSurge> And come the biggest plot twist of the anime
<MadSurge> Uguuuu~
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> Guys what do you think is cuter, Derpy smiling with her eyes open or smiling with her eyes closed? its a side view so you can't see her walleyedness
<MadSurge> SpeccyRush|Drawing: how about half closed?!
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> ya just have to make it harder for me don't ya MadSurge
<Jmo> ya.
<MadSurge> Then open
<gold_demona_> SpeccyRush|Drawing: Depedns on what she's smiling about
<gold_demona_> Depends*
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> gold_demona_: lets say she's listening to a story from a friend
<gold_demona_> Then eyes open
<Kandarihu> If this series aired during Prime Time, the sponsors would be very upset over the fact that Madoka hasn't been seen as a Magical Girl until now
<Kandarihu> ...and my flash is crashing
<Kandarihu> NM.
<Sumica> 00,10kinda an odd role reversal
<Kandarihu> Flash forward to Walpurgis Night
<Squallken> bbl
<Serenity> Hey everypony
<Roseluck`> Kandarihu, i thought you said "my fetish is crashing"
<Roseluck`> i was like WTF M8
<Kandarihu> Roseluck`, lol
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> gold_demona_: now what if I said its lyra telling the story
<gold_demona_> SpeccyRush|Drawing: I'd say it'd depend on the story more than who's telling it..
<Sumica> 00,10figure it out yet?
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> gold_demona_: existence of humans story
<gold_demona_> SpeccyRush|Drawing: Probably eyes closed them
<gold_demona_> then*
<MadSurge> Awwww
<Kandarihu> She probably used her magic to heal her heart as soon as she woke up in the hospital.
<Sumica> 00,10yep she tossed a bomb........there
<shana> not sure if fan service or not
<Kandarihu> To be clear, Homura's powers have nothing to do with fighting, but only lets her bend time and hold stuff in her giant timer. So she fills it with conventional weapons.
<Roseluck`> probably fan service
<MadSurge> So she can steal all weapons and bombs she likes and hide them in a pocket dimension
<Sumica> 00,10she also has malletspace
<Kandarihu> It's only fanservice for those who passionately love guns.
<Sumica> 00,10so yeah they are now showing all her time loops
<UncouthLurker> not all
<Roseluck`> sumica, this is my favorite episode
<Roseluck`> BETRAYAL
<Roseluck`> sad face
<Roseluck`> SAD FACE!
<Sumica> 00,10realy glad they did not have the gun shot
<Roseluck`> i watched this series originally with a socially awkward man in my AIT platoon
<MadSurge> Dat pissed/sad face
<MadSurge> Now she's serious
<Sumica> 00,10alll the dakka
<Roseluck`> she kills EVERYTHIGN
<Roseluck`> little girl with big guns
<Roseluck`> walpurgis night
<Sumica> 00,10and then we have ep1
<Roseluck`> the music for this is amazing
<MadSurge> ^
<Roseluck`> nd the action tht goes with it is just as good
<Roseluck`> such a creep creature
<MadSurge> So yeah, Madoka is the protagonist, but Homura is the herp
<MadSurge> *heroine
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> gold_demona_: just casue i'm super critical of myself here http://i.imgur.com/QINBO.png you know what they say a picture speaks more than words...
<Roseluck`> what a dick :3
<Roseluck`> how hard is it to fight in high heels
<Sumica> 00,10queue terminator theme
<gold_demona_> Hm... I think the eyes open one is better.
<Roseluck`> if you live long enough, even your greatest heros become villans
<gold_demona_> UGH! Nuuuuu My mac! It's dying! D;
<Sumica> 00,10oh and yeah, whole ep is over and now opening theme
<Roseluck`> IKR!
<Roseluck`> magical quartet?
<Sumica> 00,10glad they did that
<Sumica> 00,10cause the opening would have spoiled that ep
<Roseluck`> she has a kitty cat
<Roseluck`> and i wub it
<Roseluck`> and i want it
<Roseluck`> and im about to be kicked for overflow
<Roseluck`> ... or not.
<Sumica> 00,10it's all her falt they want madoka so badly
<p4ngya> OP?
<gold_demona_> op
<gold_demona_> And at the ending will it say "ED"? :D
<Sumica> 00,10I wonder the importants of the salt on the sholder
<gold_demona_> Isn't salt supposed to repel evil or something?
<gold_demona_> Or bad luck?
<Sumica> 00,10probably somthing to do with her coming back from a wake
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> both technically
<gold_demona_> Throwing salt over your shoulder is supposed to be good luck I think
<Sumica> 00,10yeah but her mom sprinkeld some on madokas sholder as she came home
<gold_demona_> It's a western custom, so if it's based on that it might be a misinterpretation
<gold_demona_> if
<Sumica> 00,10they have been intefearing for decades
<DocSane> Sumica: Kiyome-shio: after the funeral, before entering the house, each person throws salt behind them to ward off evil spirits; some place a large amount of salt at the entrance of their houses and step on it before entering.
<DocSane> Sumica: http://www.worldclass.net/TeachingGlobally/WorldReligions/shinto_funerals.htm
<Sumica> 00,10oh look, suns comeing up
<gold_demona_> It's it's a Shinto thing. My bad
<gold_demona_> Oh it's*
<DocSane> God, these subs...
<DocSane> I hate fan subs that just leave random words in Japanese.
<DocSane> It's not like they can't be translated.
<gold_demona_> DocSane: What do you mean?
<Sumica> 00,10he dont like the honorifics
<Sumica> 00,10here we go.
<DocSane> No, I don't like leaving Mahou Shojo and Majou in Japanese.
<gold_demona_> Sumica: Those don't really have proper translations. Only rough equivalents that sound retarded. =/
<gold_demona_> The honorifics I mean
<DocSane> My stance on honorifcs has softened over the years.
<Sumica> 00,10level in badass inbound
<DocSane> But I hate, hate, HATE fan translators that leave terms like "onii-chan" and "yatta" in Japanese.
<Sylandest> ...this is all going over my head right now
<Sumica> 00,10as I pray.......
<gold_demona_> DocSane: Yeah, that's kind of annoying.
<Sumica> 00,10yes she keeps all that in her pocket
<DocSane> So, who was the Walpurgis Night before she became a witch?
<MadSurge> DocSane: it's an amalgama of witches
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> Sumica: talk about hammerspace
<MadSurge> Oh btw NO SELL
<DocSane> MadSurge: Ah, okay. I was never clear on that point.
<DocSane> A friend of mine hates this show.
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> oh and gold_demona_ thanks for ze input
<sub06905> o.o, what show is this?
<gold_demona_> No problem SpeccyRush|Drawing
<DocSane> She hates all things "girly", hates magical girl shows, and HATES how this story went.
<MadSurge> DocSane: does he like giant robots?
<DocSane> MadSurge: She. No, not particularly. Likes space opera mostly, like Space Battleship Yamato.
<MadSurge> sub06905: Puella Magi Madoka Magica
<sub06905> oh thx MadSurge
<XAX> Good night gentlemen.
<sub06905> night XAX
<Sumica> 00,10piffff, yamato, a space opera
<MadSurge> DocSane: because Bokurano is the equivalent of this show for giant robots
<MadSurge> Night XAX
<DocSane> Sumica: How is Yamato not a space opera?
<Sumica> 00,10it's an action show in space.
<Sumica> 00,10it's world building is lacking
<Kencolt> Sumica: Um... that's the DEFINTION of Space Opera.
<DocSane> Sumica: Um... Its world-building is top notch.
<Sumica> 00,10it's not a bad show but it's not close to space opera
<DocSane> Sumica: It's probably THE definitive anime space opera.
<Sumica> 00,10right
<DocSane> How much Yamato have you seen?
<Sumica> 00,10also odd that's the end of the video
<Kencolt> Sumica: You are mistaken. It IS Space Opera. It's up there in the genre with the original Lensman Novels and the SKylark series.
<Squallken> before i go on with my day I have this to say about this anime
<Sumica> 00,10and yeah, tired
<Squallken> Harvey Dent was right
<gold_demona_> Aww, end of stream
<MadSurge> Nighty Sumica :(
<DocSane> You either die young or live long enough to see yourself the villain?

<Sylandest> MisterSkids: After listening to it, I would say you've got some potential there. Your tone is good, as is your range of sound. My only suggestion, if you do another, is to watch your clarity. A couple words were a bit muffled, but aside from that, good job :)
<Hoody|Skool> Don't pity You, he can't help it
<MisterSkids> thx, part of the problem is my CNY accent and another my mic is total and utter crap
<MisterSkids> im glad u like it
<LightTrooper105> MisterSkids nice
<Sylandest> MisterSkids: no worries, it was well done! :)
<MisterSkids> Thx, im still waiting for a responce but everypony i ask says its good
<LightTrooper105> it is good
<MisterSkids> and Sylandest im glad u gave also some helpful critsism thats what i like, ways to improve
<Sylandest> MisterSkids: anytime :)
<MisterSkids> i tryed an angry raw approach with it first but i didnt like it so itryed a slower sadder approach...bingo
<Sylandest> MisterSkids: Aye. The tempo of a speech, as well as the emotion applied to it, can affect the overall performance. You have to get just the right balance to get the effect you desire. Learned that in my Communications course here at Uni.
<MisterSkids> oh and a...my other videos r of me and my buddys being idiots lol
<Sylandest> hehehe
<MisterSkids> thats it too, just the right emotion for the job, with the right accent and flow of words
<Sylandest> Unfortunately, I have to head out for a tiny bit. Moving from dorm to classroom. Be back in a little bit, everypony

<pony_3290> happy nightmare night bronies!
<MisterSkids> hmmm? well thats just my theory is all
<MisterSkids> too u to pony_3290
<pony_3290> what is the worst shipping you can think of?
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> MisterSkids: its just that any discussion on season 3 (even if you were not intending it to be) will result in a ban from chat right now
<pony_3290> how long will that ban be?
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> perma
<pony_3290> ooooooooooooooooooooo
<MisterSkids> woah thats kinda harsh, understandable if things get out of hand but WOW that HARSH
*MisterSkids zips lips with real zipper
<Serenity> SpeccyRush|Drawing: I'm quite sure it's not perma
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> albeit i said perma i believe you can send an appeal for said ban
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> but it won't run out with time
<pony_3290> do you get reply with ban appeal?
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> ask someone who's been banned or ask a mod if you decide to make them self known in chat at the time
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> *if they decide to make themselves known

<Kawaii_icybeauti> I 4got to greet you Saturn I apologize. Hi there!
<MadSurge> Kawaii_icybeauti: yeah, that's a pretty good motive to cancel school I mean

<MadSurge> Ahhh it's fine then :)
<Saturn> 08,01i taught the 5th years (16/17 year olds) how to fork bomb a linux machine
<Saturn> 08,01now *that* got them interested in getting a Raspberry Pi
<Kawaii_icybeauti> That sounds rad!
<MisterSkids> that sounds ummm....i have no idea how that sounds
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I just see the word "bomb" I think it might be cool
*Saturn 08,01has a feeling that he's doing more to drive the uptake of learning programming and computer science in that school than anything else has done in a long time
<MadSurge> Kawaii_icybeauti: one good thing of living in europe, no monstruous perturbations coming your way
<Shizuka> 13that feel when you wake up wondering why your legs are chalk white and so smooth.. then i realize i was so tired yesterday i crashed out without taking tights off
<Saturn> 08,01Shizuka: yes
<MadSurge> Shizuka: :D
<Brovakiin|Assassin> That happens to me all the time
<Saturn> 08,01tights are warm
<Saturn> 08,01i'm actually wearing tights right now
<Shizuka> 13see saturn knows
<Saturn> 08,01because goddamn, it's cold in scotland
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Europeans....
*Saturn 08,01isn't even joking
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> Saturn is manly man
<Kawaii_icybeauti> If you got caught wearing tights in my town without being a girl....
<MadSurge> I have no thighs, but I had to put on shoes today because my feet were freezing and slippers weren't enough
<Shizuka> 13you have no thighs!
<Lil_B> I used to wear Tightrs on extremly colöd days too...
<MadSurge> Shizuka: OH NO! *tumbles down*
<Shizuka> 13morning bronystate crowd is more fashionable :3
<Jmo> o.o
<MadSurge> Morning Shizu :)
<Saturn> 08,01my tights are boring black ones
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I remember the way my mom would bundle me up on the typical NY winter days....Tights, then 2 pairs of socks, 2 pairs of pants...like 1000 shirts, jacket, boots, gloves, scarf...I was ready for venturing in the artic...
<MisterSkids> im 45% scottish :)
<Lil_B> and hi evryone :)
*Saturn 08,01should get some bright pink tights
<Lil_B> everyone*
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> Shizuka: I've been here for night and morn so I guess I'm the exception :P
<ASoftFluffyThing> I haven't worn tights since I was a kid
<Shizuka> 13i've always been partial to white
<MisterSkids> HAHA Kawaii, i live on the edge of the adirondacks, alot of us just walk around in shorts in the winter
<Kawaii_icybeauti> ASoftFluffyThing: I would wear them when I was still dancing, but sinc eI wuit that, no more tights unless it's cold and I'm wearing a dress/skirt,
*MadSurge wears almost only jeans
<MisterSkids> no joke
<ASoftFluffyThing> I wear leggings but not tights
<Shizuka> 13tights let you extend shorts season by like three weeks
<Kawaii_icybeauti> My mom is from a tropical country, she didn't know what winter was, so she would kill us with clothing
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> Shizuka !! :O http://i.imgur.com/3RF2V.gif ...I kid
<Lil_B> what to do first? Staying in Bronystate and Listening to Tuesday Tech Talk, or watching the new VGA Episodes >.<
<MisterSkids> i wear kahkis most of the time during the colder seasons
<Shizuka> 13SpeccyRush|Drawing: hey black is okay but doesn't usually go with my outfits
<MisterSkids> and the warm seasons
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Because I'm older and because of global warming, I go in jeans mostly, maybe a skirt and leggings every now and then.
<Shizuka> 13i wear black jackets if it makes it less raaaaaaaacist
<MisterSkids> dam i love kahkis
<MadSurge> Shizuka: you like more colourful clothes?
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> Shizuka: but black is supposed to go with everything
<Kawaii_icybeauti> New York=Black clothing. Even as a small child I wore black. it's like a funeral everyday...
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> oh oh Shizuka http://imgur.com/gallery/POde6 you may have seen it though
<Shizuka> 13MadSurge: not in winter... usually blues and blacks
<Shizuka> 13i have some dimmer reds for summer but i'm pretty boring .-.
<Shizuka> 13is why white goes better
<Saturn> 08,01Shizuka: pics or i call shenanigans.

<Shizuka> 13pff light
<Shizuka> 13who needs it
<Saturn> 08,01i do! i love light!
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Like 90% of my closet is black. Plus the dark blues for denim, and only a bit of my closet actually invovles color, mostly my cheerleading clothing.
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> now if I ever were to wear white in winter, specifically after a snow... all you'd see is a tuft of hair floating around...
<MisterSkids> im writing atm soo im in and out of the conversation
<Saturn> 08,01i'm a cross between a plant and a cat
*Shizuka 13sneezes at bright light .-.
*SpeccyRush|Drawing is very pale
<Saturn> 08,01i like light, warm places
<MadSurge> I somehow keep choosing tshirts with black "background" o__o
<MisterSkids> can WAIT till it snows, i love the winter season
<Saturn> 08,01MisterSkids: blargh, i hate the snow
<Kawaii_icybeauti> MisterSkids: It didn't snow anythign last year for me, I hope we get some.

<Sylandest> RealMisterSkids: oh, you did?
<ASoftFluffyThing> MadSurge, in Minecraft silly

<MadSurge> ASoftFluffyThing: oh sorry :D
<Shizuka> 13i hate comcast
<Shizuka> 13so much
<Shizuka> 13can't even begin to describe how much i hate comcast
<Cades> sorry for being so idle, I'm just at school
<Sylandest> RealMisterSkids: I found it, viewing now :)
<RealMisterSkids> kk
<RealMisterSkids> btw how does one copy anothers name so fast

<RealMisterSkids> very nice idea for a chat room
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Spotlight Music: Fears / Flaedr - Nighttime Queen / K3WRO - Hivemind
<RealMisterSkids> oh cool i can use my name again brb
<Panda> Sylmare?
<Sylmare> Panda: I got hit by a r63 beam~
<Maid_Major> Shizuka not even for a Twix?
<Panda> Shizuka, surely there is another ISP in your area ^^
<Shizuka> 13Panda: nope, it's comcast, satellite for twice the price and half the speed, or dialup
<Shizuka> 13we pay $75 a month for 12/4 with comcast, and this year we've had maybe 80% uptime
<Panda> oh damn... wait...what about your cell phone Shizuka?
<Shizuka> 13can't tether
<Panda> :/ how come?
<MisterSkids> im bak
<Shizuka> 13costs too much
<Shizuka> 13for three lines with unlimited data it'll be $150 a month
<Shizuka> 13and that was the best offer
<Panda> Eh? I can tether for free. Geez what cell phone company do you have? O-o
<Shizuka> 13t-mobile
<Kimori> its ok
<pot80> bfbrb (back from brb (back from be right back))
<Kimori> It wasnt possible for me to go on the internet while I was in school :P
<Shizuka> 13not to mention that the "unlimited" is really "4G speed up to 2GB, then 2G speed after that" which means we may as well be on dialup if we tethered
<Kimori> unless I had the computer infront of me..
<Panda> What the hell? they are ripping you off. I have tmobile and 2 lines and it doesnt cost NEARLY that much.
<Shizuka> 13that's america
<ASoftFluffyThing> Mmm...s'pose I should get some wool
<Shizuka> 13company lobbies government to keep everyone else out, gets to drive prices through the roof
<Panda> Sounds about right.
*Jmo pokes ASoftFluffyThing
<Jmo> Wooool~
<Panda> So t-mobile actually charges people to teather their phones?
<pot80> ASoftFluffyThing can you find anything other than pigs and cows that usually happens for me :P
<ASoftFluffyThing> Jmo, YOU BROK DA WOOLS
<Jmo> :3
<Panda> I just rooted my phone and tethered that way >.>
<ASoftFluffyThing> pot80, it depends on which biome you're in.
<Jmo> It's mah dye.
<Jmo> I do wut I want :>
<ASoftFluffyThing> Sheep are just about everywhere except for deserts.
<pot80> whenever i need food all I get is sheep and whenever I need wool I get pigs and cows XD
<Panda> pot80 uh... are you playing harvest moon or something?
<pot80> nope I'm a newb to the game and I had no idea what I was doing at the time :P
<Shizuka> 13it's a separate plan anyway
*Maid_Major hasn't played Harvest Moon in years
<Panda> Maid_Major, play the recent ones O_O they are so good...
<MadSurge> No stream yet :(

<MisterSkids> Back Story: Theres a reason hes called Shock Top. Tortured when he was by other's for his strange behavior. And just one prank too many, and Shock just finally snapped. Using a using some a small hand buzzer and a water pistol, we was able to get back at the little children by assualting them with electricty. And it was after that day that that he, Shock Top and created many more unique weapons, ranging from melee to chemical.

<RainbowAsh> Sundaysmile, Nightmare Night, what a fright, give me something sweet to bite!
<Maid_Major> Trick or treat! :)
<Sundaysmile> :)
<Kammerjunk> RainbowAsh: Oh hey, someone else who listens to TarbyRocks.
<Kammerjunk> He really is underrated.
*Sundaysmile gives RainbowAsh a toffee Apple
*Sundaysmile give Kammerjunk nothing
<MisterSkids> crap i gtg to work soon, hopefully its outside work than i can work on my fan fic as i write
<Kammerjunk> ohokay
<Kammerjunk> What's really annoying is that kids in my neighbourhood still celebrate it.
<MisterSkids> no wait as i walk i ment not write lol
<Kammerjunk> I thought they'd have learned by now.
*Sundaysmile gives Maid_Mayor smores
<Barb|SoMuchBLOOD> Who wants to have a chatventure?
<MisterSkids> best thing is scaring little kids with tricks not treats
<RainbowAsh> Kammerjunk, I am afraid not. Who is that Tarby and how many Rocks are we talking about?
<MisterSkids> chatventure Barb|SoMuchBLOOD
<MisterSkids> ?
<Sundaysmile> as long as your not turning tricks :P
<Kammerjunk> RainbowAsh: You were quoting his Nightmare Night ._.
<Kammerjunk> Maybe. I don't know. I don't follow a lot of brony musicians, and the ones I do are underrated.
<Chrysalis> Chatventure sounds dangerously like rp
<Chrysalis> and rp isnt allowed
<RainbowAsh> Kammerjunk, I was quoting the series Oo
<Kammerjunk> There's a series?
<Barb|SoMuchBLOOD> Its something I just came up with. Its like "Pick a page" type story book, but in a chat room, with like 1 or 2 people providing the choices
<MisterSkids> oh no nothing like that lol, masks hiding in bushes that sort of thing....that doesnt help my case does it
<Barb|SoMuchBLOOD> If you guys want too I need a volunteer to help me
<Jmo> Will there be blood?
<Barb|SoMuchBLOOD> Might have to do that this evening though, so make sure you can be on.
<Jmo> :P
<RainbowAsh> Kammerjunk, it's what the fillies shout in Luna Eclipsed
<Barb|SoMuchBLOOD> Jmo no. The blood is all gone.
<Kammerjunk> RainbowAsh: Oh. Right. Well, TarbyRocks is a brony rock musician. Fairly good.
<Jmo> Damn.
<Barb|SoMuchBLOOD> It will be a ghost story for sure. =0
<Kammerjunk> Also did a 20 minute progessive rock song about the-fic-that-shall-not-be-named.
<MisterSkids> sry i gotta work till 10 Barb|SoMuchBLOOD and after that go to a resutrunt
<Barb|SoMuchBLOOD> It will be fun.
<Barb|SoMuchBLOOD> Aw. =9
<Barb|SoMuchBLOOD> My keyboard is dieing
<Barb|SoMuchBLOOD> lol
<Barb|SoMuchBLOOD> I can't be bothered to find batteries.
<Sundaysmile> rub it against a wooly sweater, static electricity will do
<Kammerjunk> Lithium-ion batteries are best batteries.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Barb|SoMuchBLOOD, dying*
<Chrysalis> people still use wireless keyboards?
<Chrysalis> but they are so slow
<Kammerjunk> No memory effect is the best.
<Barb|SoMuchBLOOD> Anyways. I will make up a story for tonight. I have one question, do you guys want it to be about ponies or no?
<alexxm> is there a stream?
<Barb|SoMuchBLOOD> I can't be bothered to check my spelling and grammer either ASoftFluffyThing
<Chrysalis> Barb|SoMuchBLOOD it wont be in here or youll get the wrath of mods
<Barb|SoMuchBLOOD> I can make a room.
<Barb|SoMuchBLOOD> And I dunno why. Its not like I would do it during a stream.
<Chrysalis> advertising other rooms is against rules
<Barb|SoMuchBLOOD> Cuase you know, I would want to watch the streams
<Sundaysmile> what stories?
<Chrysalis> thing is people tend to go overboard in rp
<Chrysalis> no matter how you try to stop them
<Barb|SoMuchBLOOD> The back seat modding is so strong in this chat room. Fine buzz kill.
<Jmo> Chrysalis, did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed bro
<Chrysalis> Jmo not really, i just cannot stand rp
<Kammerjunk> RP in itself is allowed, but yeah, excessive amounts of it isn't allowed and it does have a tendency to go overboard.
<Sundaysmile> tom is best mod
<RainbowAsh> Kammerjunk, nice vocals
<Chrysalis> !cd
<Tom> Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire, Part 1" airs in 9 days, 20 hours, 34 minutes, 6 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012 UTC)
<Kammerjunk> SOON.
<Chrysalis> Thanks tom!
<ASoftFluffyThing> Nine days.
<RainbowAsh> Not soon enough
<ASoftFluffyThing> NINE. DAYS.
<Sundaysmile> nine days until the chat becomes FLOODED with ponyfolks
<Kammerjunk> I can't wait to observe the Mane 6 rooms from the comfort of regulars.
<Sundaysmile> nine days until technical difficulties :P
<BladedWings|AFK> 9 days until best birthday gift evar ^_^
<Kammerjunk> BladedWings: Your birthday is on the S3 release date?
<twilight_sprinkle> Sundaysmile: ^
<VenHur> So I heard Disney brought Lucasfilm Ltd and plans to make Episode VII, VIII, and IX.
<BladedWings> Kammerjunk: the season 3 release date is on my birthday lol...i was born to watch ponies :D
<Kammerjunk> Yup.
<Kammerjunk> BladedWings: That is awesome.
<VenHur> ...I facepalmed.
<BladedWings> VenHur: i knew about 7 but 8 and 9!?
<Kammerjunk> BladedWings: Disney said they were planning to have a Star Wars film produced every 2-3 years.
<VenHur> That's means we had to suffer from more Jar Jar Blinks...
<Kammerjunk> ^
<Kammerjunk> I can only hope for it taking place in the Old Republic.
<BladedWings> Kammerjunk: oh dear sweet luna -_(\
<Jmo> What I wanna know is who is going to be acting Luke, Leia and Han Solo.
<RainbowAsh> Kammerjunk, don't give them ideas to make time travel canon
<Jmo> :<
<Kammerjunk> Hey, if there's going to be a new Star Wars film, I want to see the Jedi Wars.
<Kammerjunk> Jedi Civil War*
<VenHur> I think Episode VII, VIII, and IX are the sequel trillogy, and I don't know much of the Star Wars universe...
<Kammerjunk> I want some Revan and Malak up in these films.
<Sundaysmile> Well they've already stated they'll do another three involving the cast from Star Wars IV onwards no?
<Barb|SoMuchBLOOD> Eh. I would not see a chatventure as an rp, but I can see how it would turn into that very easily.
<Sundaysmile> sorry not the cast
<Sundaysmile> the characters
<Barb|SoMuchBLOOD> And that would be against the rules fo sho.
<Kammerjunk> Sundaysmile: Then I'll be glad to see Ewan McGregor again.
<VenHur> Besides the characters, the Lightsabers, the Death Star, and...Jar Jar Blinks... *facepalm*
<Barb|SoMuchBLOOD> I doubt I could come up with anything really interesting anyways.
<VenHur> AT LEAST THE SEQUEL TRILLOGY BETTER BE AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINALS! :[
<Kammerjunk> I dunno, I like McGregor. I just think he had a case of bad writing.
<alexxm> but isn't everyone in the original films old
<Sundaysmile> It's very rare that a sequel tops the original these days
<MisterSkids> i was gone there what is happening all of the sudden?
<Sundaysmile> and disney's sequels don't seem to make the cut...
<Kammerjunk> Sundaysmile: That's because nostalgia is a cruel mistress.
<Stormy`> @__@
<Stormy`> Netsplit?
<Sundaysmile> indeed
<RainbowAsh> Well, to be fair, after SWTOR, it's an act of mercy to put the franchise out of its misery
<Kimori> looks like it..
<Kammerjunk> I kind of want to play KoTOR now.
<VenHur> We all know that Disney and Lucasfilm goes a long way back since Star Tours...
<Sundaysmile> though it could've been worse... it could've been bought by 4kids entertainment or something
<RainbowAsh> http://7.asset.soup.io/asset/3851/6887_c1e9.jpeg
<Kammerjunk> Oh lol
<Sundaysmile> LOL
<Kammerjunk> INB4 Mickey Mouse is main character in Star Wars VII.
<VenHur> Thanks god it was Disney...which actually makes sense! Because Disney and Lucasfilm cooperates a few times to makes the Star Tours attraction and adds the trademarked Star Wars characters in meet and greet spots and parades.
<Stormy_> Does this work?
<Sundaysmile> though to be honest I've not been the biggest fan of the marvel shows they've produced lately
<Kimori> ?
<Kammerjunk> I'm just glad Disney decided to leave everything as it is in Lucasfilm.
<Stormy_> Just checking if I was actually connected
<Stormy_> I got disconnected like 3 times already
<Stormy_> Was there a netsplit?
<Chrysalis> Kammerjunk for now
<Kimori> Whats wierd is ive yet to have tne netsplit get to me
<Chrysalis> theyll change it once the fanboys stop crying
<Stormy_> that's odd
<MisterSkids> darth mickey
<Stormy_> when I first signed in it was just the two SRs and my other computer
<Kammerjunk> I'm surprised they haven't taken a cue from EA. If it doesn't hurt income, it's probably fine.
<VenHur> Guys. Calm down about the acqusion....sorry for the typo, but really, chill phils.
<Kammerjunk> Hey, I'm just sayin'. I'm sure Star Wars VII will be at least as good as the prequels.
<Stormy_> I connected directly to charizard and it seems to have stopped, so maybe it's just a shaymin problem?
<RainbowAsh> Kammerjunk, you're right, it's good to manage your expectations
<Kammerjunk> Dat SB.
*NewSpookyBronyU glomps Kammerjunk
<NewSpookyBronyU> 11,02Moo o.o
<Kammerjunk> Moo indeed, good sir.
<NewSpookyBronyU> 11,02Happy Nightmare Night ^-^
<MisterSkids> woot
<ekips> oh, nightmare night is today?
<Lil_B> Aloa Everyone :)
<MadSurge> Moo NewSpookyBronyU :3
<NewSpookyBronyU> 11,02I've been a good pony so the Great Pumpkin is going to give me presents tonight :D
<RainbowAsh> http://e.asset.soup.io/asset/3851/6126_7c53_500.jpeg
<VenHur> NewSpookyBronyU: Hey SpookyBrony, heard the news? Yesterday, Disney brought Lucasfilms Ltd. For like...4 million dollars I think?
<Sundaysmile> Inb4 kidnapping and candy ransom
<Kammerjunk> Billion.
<MadSurge> NewSpookyBronyU: an early WiiU? :D
<NewSpookyBronyU> 11,024 million? lol
<Kammerjunk> RainbowAsh: o u
<NewSpookyBronyU> 11,02MadSurge: Dat would be cool ;3;
<ekips> NewSpookyBronyU Will you go for a Trick or Treat round in your neighbourhood?
<Kandarihu> I hear it was in the billions
<NewSpookyBronyU> 11,02VenHur: Yesh, I heard about it :3 They're coming out with Episode 7 in 2015
<Shammy> VenHur: no...it was 3 billion..
<VenHur> NewSpookyBronyU: And Episode VIII and IX.
<Kammerjunk> Nope, 4.1.
<Kammerjunk> Rougly.
<NewSpookyBronyU> 11,02ekips: Maybeh o.o However, I might be staying home to give out candy. We're expecting 600 kids to visit our house this year.
<Kammerjunk> Oh wow.
<Sundaysmile> 4.1a and one half
<MadSurge> Inb4 episode 7 is WAY better than the second trilogy anyway :D
<VenHur> NewSpookyBronyU: So be prepared for more Jar Jar Blinks and "NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!".
<Sundaysmile> inb4 massed fan rage after release :P
<ekips> 600 kids? Usually, noone visits my home for trick or treat
<Kammerjunk> Well, it's not done yet, so so far, it as good as the prequels.
<NewSpookyBronyU> 11,02Jar Jar Binks is Disney's favorite character because he's the comic relief :D
<VenHur> Pfft, yeah right...
<Kammerjunk> INB4 Jar Jar Binks as main character.
<VenHur> ^ FUCK NO!
<VenHur> ANYTHING BUT NOT THAT!
<J_E_Smith71> NewSpookyBronyU: I guess there must not be any Trunk or Treat things around you. Around me all the church trunk or treats steal all the trick or treaters and no one goes door to door anymore. Haven't had a single one in four years
<Kammerjunk> Well, I'm going to go eat whatchamacallits.
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: :D that would be a suicude
<Kammerjunk> Fritters? I think they're called fritters.
<MadSurge> *suicide
<Kammerjunk> You know, the ones you shower in jam and icing sugar.
<NewSpookyBronyU> 11,02J_E_Smith71: D:
<RainbowAsh> And I am off again. Bai

<Jmo> Oh jeez.
<Amu-chan> I used to have a computer that because it had a horrible wireless adapter, it would ping timeout regularly.
<Jmo> I didn't mean to literally call you guys
<Jmo> Just me and Ayejay having a talk.
<VenHur> In the future, Justin Biber and Rebbeca Blac k are married...and they're kid...SINGS WORSE!

<Eli> Fluttershyfan158: i have nothing against grimdark, it just doesn't fit ponies one bit
<MisterSkids> i seen both raonbow factory and cupcakes to my horrow
<Fluttershyfan158> I luv cupcakes..
<killerpony7733> Fluttershyfan158 Just be careful bringing that up. Kinda is poking the rules by bringing it up here in mane chat
<Stormy_> ...so apparently I got 100% on that paper I was complaining about a couple weeks ago
<MadSurge> I has licorice :3
<Fluttershyfan158> Oh..nv
<artist> Fluttershyfan158: have you heard micthemicrophone read them? its hilarious
<Fluttershyfan158> nevermind
<Fluttershyfan158> I heard that Mic The Microphone is a jerk..
<Stormy_> I'm pretty sure it was nowhere near that good because I just wrote it at the last minute and didn't care...
<Amu-chan> At one point I had both the computer with crappy wireless, and a computer with much better wireless running at the same time and connected to the same IRC network, and I would get ping timeouts with the one while the other would still be working fine.
<MisterSkids> and why did he have to go and name it cupcakes, i thnk he was making sure EVERYBODY remeber that dammed movie
<artist> movie...?
<MisterSkids> its a...youtube video now

<MadSurge> 'ey Slendamann, Saul Slendamann
<Sundaysmile> Slender 2 will be out probably by the end of the year
<Malavolent> I was too afraid to even start playing Slender.
<MadSurge> Sundaysmile: and this time it will have a DIFFERENT PIANO KEY! OMG
<Malavolent> I don't like these kinds of games.
<Eli> MadSurge: he only startled me once really... he sat in the freaking back of the truck the page was on... damn didn't see him till i was really close
<Sundaysmile> you should play Cry of Fear Malavolent
<Malavolent> Sundaysmile: Haha.
<Malavolent> No.
<Everlasting_Nightmar> "Hysterical Society", and her I thought I was the only one who called it that.
<Sundaysmile> how come? not like it?
*Reikim walks in the front door, then breaks a window because some jokes have to be kept alive
<AJIsAwesome> ?
<MadSurge> Malavolent: don't bother, it's just jumpscare:the game
<Everlasting_Nightmar> Sundaysmile: No, I just call things silly names for fun.
<Eli> who's reading and what?
<AJIsAwesome> Ghosties. Silent Ponyville. I think.
<Malavolent> I dislike horror games and I despise jumpscare games.
<Sundaysmile> Then why are you playing Slender :P
<AJIsAwesome> Either that or just a Silent Hill fanfic.
<MadSurge> Malavolent: because you get scared easily?
<Malavolent> I said I've never played it.
<Reikim> So what's up, everyone?
<Malavolent> Too scared.
<Everlasting_Nightmar> Howdy Reikim!
<AJIsAwesome> Nothing much, Reikim. :)
<Malavolent> MadSurge: Yeah, pretty much.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and then everyone told Reikim he won 3rd place
<Sundaysmile> ah, I thought you said otherwise
<AJIsAwesome> How about you?
<Eli> Malavolent: i don't like it either. just made an exception for halloween
<Sundaysmile> my mistake
<Reikim> What did I miss?
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome! *hugs* Happy Halloween!
<Reikim> ...Whut

<MadSurge> Malavolent: well, you can watch LPs of those (not Slendamann, please :D )
<Reikim> I'm about as shocked as the rest of you.
<Reikim> HOW DID THAT HAPPEN
<Lil_B> Reikim I guess "shocked" is the right adjective for today
<Reikim> ...I'm confused
<Malavolent> MadSurge: Well I watched 11 drunk guys playing slender etc. if that counts.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> first RaveBrony http://i.imgur.com/ZiahI.jpg second panda http://i.imgur.com/06CNQ.jpg

<Serenity> Didn't say it was.
<Everlasting_Nightmar> Malavolent: But it sure is fun :).
<Malavolent> Hell yeah.
<Lil_B> Malavolent nope, Halloween doesn't exist (exept that itr got injected into Society during the last decate by Capitalism...) it's basiclly copying what the US is doing
<Reikim> Rave, it's fucking awesome.
<Malavolent> I wouldn't be afraid of Slender, if you could defend yourself somehow.
<Malavolent> It's the feeling of hopelessness that scares me.
<thelonepony> Hi Starspooky :)
<RaveBrony> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: You want me to edit it for luna? Its a simple fix of a few layers O.o
<ekips> Malavolent some elementary schools organize trick or treat rounds and a few people do halloween parties. But nothing major
<RaveBrony> Reikim: Thank you so much :)
<Serenity> Malavolent: Let me amend that: If him finding you didn't sound like GabeN falling on a piano
<Lil_B> Malavolent I prtefer Amnesia over Slender :3
<Reikim> So yeaaaah.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> some people don't get jokes
<Reikim> I wish I'd done colour, but not enough skill or time.
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Starspooky. :)
<Malavolent> Serenity: Hah, you made me lol with that :D
<Reikim> Need to learn SAI. Need to get tablet.

<Malavolent> Lil_B: Well I played Amnesia at my friend's place, it was quite fun when there are more of you.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hey that's what i'm doing
<Reikim> Trying to do computer art with a mouse hurts.
<Serenity> British Halloween: Bunch of nabs come to your door asking for sweets and cake, and I'm like NOOEEE
<Reikim> Like a bitch.
<NewSpookyBronyU> 11,02twilight_sprinkle: Ghosties :)
<Lil_B> Malavolent actually, today is another Holiday for evangelics here, but well... lts just say it doesn't "sell" well
<Reikim> Although it's partially my fault for insisting on conserving the sketchy art style.
<thelonepony> Ohai Tiowilight_sprankls :3
<twilight_sprinkle> o, thx NewSpookyBronyU
<RaveBrony> Yeah
<Eli> hi twilight_sprinkle
<Malavolent> Serenity: Since when is there a tradition of trick-or-treating in UK?

<Reikim> Just checking.
<Serenity> It's only ghosties, what did you expect? :3
<Eli> shana: you celebrating Halloween?
<Malavolent> Lil_B: We don't even call it Halloween here, it's more like "the day when you remember the dead".
<Serenity> Malavolent: Day of the DED
<Reikim> I honestly tried doing it on computer, because it would have looked really nice.
<Reikim> However, it was way too time-consuming.
<Malavolent> We go visit the graveyeards and pay respects to the dead ones, basically.
<Malavolent> Serenity: Well, yeah.
<Lil_B> Malavolent and it has nothing to do with Candy or Costumes right?
<Malavolent> Lil_B: Not at all. And I don't think that trick-or-treating will get here anytime soon.
<Lil_B> Malavolent yeah we have that too, but on another date

<Stormy_> haha, sad thing is a lot of our customers would probably believe that...
<Lil_B> Ohay Mark
<Mark> night, Malavolent. :3
<Lil_B> night Malavolent !
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> people give windows a hard time about telling you to restart after updates
<Mark> Ohai, Lil_B. :3
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> osx tells you much much more frequently.
<Stormy_> At least he hasn't come back yet, so maybe he figured it out
<Lil_B> Mark you are my favourite customer
<alexxm> bye Malavolent
<Reikim> Whelp, nothing much happening.
<Reikim> So
<Reikim> I'm out!
<Reikim> PEACE!
<Mark> Lil_B: Thanks. Bye doggy!
<NightmareBlade> bye Reikim
<Mark> Bye Reikim. :3
*Reikim jumps out through the window
<Lil_B> bye reik... DAMNIT
<Stormy_> People complain about that?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> yes
<Stormy_> Unless your computer takes forever to start up I don't see why it would matter
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I dont like closing all my stuff.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> but osx seriously pisses me off it reminds me every 5 minutes to restart
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and you can't tell it to stop reminding you.
<Stormy_> I just keep hitting postpone until I'm not doing anything anymore
<Stormy_> That must be annoying
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> it is
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> at least with windows you can postpone it for like 4 hours
<Stormy_> I have this old Mac Mini that I got from work; it's super slow so I barely ever use it
<Stormy_> And that's the extent of my experience with OSX
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Ive bitten the bullet and bought a few apple laptops
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Just because I was pissed off at other stuff available.
<Stormy_> I'm actually considering getting one as my next laptop
<alexxm> the chat seems ded
<pot80> Ok what did I miss?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Ive had more problems with this laptop though than any other laptop i have owned
<Stormy_> I'll just dual boot Windows
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> major issues where it locks up and wont do anything
<Stormy_> And buy one used so I don't give Apple money :P
<Kimori> I take it your not an apple fan?
<pot80> ok...
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I actually do kind of like osx for productivity
<Stormy_> I've never heard of a Mac laptop falling apart, unlike this piece of crap... :(
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> the gestures are nice.
<Stormy_> Kimori: No, not at all
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> swithcing around and multitasking seems more fluid.
<AJIsAwesome> Nothing much.
<pot80> anyone up for some minecraft classic multiplayer?
<Stormy_> It's like 50% brand loyalty and 50% not liking their business practices
<Vordox> Bwhauhua, saved a good piece that got deleted by youtube. :P
<Lil_B> Vordox Fluttercrys reading?
<Vordox> Lil_B: No, there are many good videos that gets taken down by youtube
<Whizzbang> silent ponyville?
<Lil_B> pot80 you mean the free version you can play in your browser?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I have to admit something though, I do own an iphone.
<Vordox> I just got lucky one of my favourite One Piece stuff. :p
<Lil_B> oh :P
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> but the new nexus 4 is mightly tempting @ $299 unlocked
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> off contract
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> thats a great buy for a smartphone.
<pot80> Lil_B: yeah the game screws over when I try using the main game :P
<pot80> carrots?
<Stormy_> I like my Galaxy S2, but it's the only smartphone I've ever owned
<Stormy_> So I don't have much for comparison
<Lil_B> pot80 but what do you wanna do in the classic version? you can only place blocks :P
<Kimori> I agree apple is not the nicest company to deal with
<cachi01> hi everypony :) EHRMAGERD GHOSTIES STREAM? :O
<pot80> Lil_B: I dunno maby a project of some sort?

<AJIsAwesome> cachi01: Ghosties is reading a story, but SB's streaming it.

<valoreins> oh wow a fanfic reading eh
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Im considering an ipad mini.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Or the 4th gen ipad… haven't decided.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> probably unnessecary.
<valoreins> btw guys i need help, seems like my big bro got addicted to WoW, i have trouble now going to internet because he's using the pc all the time
<cachi01> read 40 creepypasta yesterday.........im scared of my own shadow and weird exe files now :D
<Stormy_> I remember when you were saying the iPad was the stupidest thing ever
<Everlasting_Nightmar> I'm getting "No Mercy" vibes from L4D with this hospital setting.
<Stormy_> Everyone made fun of it when it first came out... now everyone loves it
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> it is stupid
<Everlasting_Nightmar> valoreins: I'm sorry to say, you're screwed.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Its gimmicky.
<cachi01> valoreins: WoW addiction? uhmmm yeah thas iincurable
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and I hardly ever use mine.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> :P
<Stormy_> then why would you buy another one? lol
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Because I kind of want one with cellular connection so I can use it whereever,.
<valoreins> i just dont get it, i also played Wow but i never get addicted, dafuq big bro?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> would make it more useful.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I dont like tethering because it sucks battery too much.
<pot80> valoreins: yeah its a hell of an addiction (thinks back to worlds greatest freakout)
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I have an ipad 2 i bought a while back
<thelonepony> valoreins: Is he A RPG Type of guy?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I bought the original one too but i gave it to my dad.
<valoreins> thelonepony: yup
<thelonepony> Well WoW Is A mmorpg so
<thelonepony> YOur fuck
<Stormy_> I don't own any tablets
<thelonepony> your*
<pot80> All I can say is... WoW! (I'm sorry I had to)
<Stormy_> I'm considering getting one though so I don't have to lug this huge laptop with me everywhere
<thelonepony> Scamfuckinwow :P
<valoreins> now i'll have less time here because of that, screw it
<thelonepony> valoreins: Get a Computer/laptop
<oni_link> valoreins: I was like that for awhile, then my free trial ran out XD
<Stormy_> that friend I was talking about before just got that Nexus 7 to replace his HP Touchpad
<cachi01> why did i read then my free trial ran out as but then i took an arrow to the knee?
<Stormy_> He bought the touchpad when it was on sale for $99 and is now selling it for $130...
<shana> Eli: no, I even forgot it was today :)
<oni_link> cachi01: I have no idea
<Kimori> Wasnt the HP touchpad discountinued?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> yes
<Stormy_> No one wants to buy it from him because he went around bragging when he bought it about how cheap it was
<Eli> shana: yeah, we don't really celebrate it here... shame tho
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> they did a firesale of them for $99
<Kimori> I remember
<cachi01|creepypasta> brb
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I wanted to get one but everywhere sold out.
<pot80> cachi01: whaaa? XD Me no understand
<oni_link> lol
<Kimori> I probably shouldive bought one too
<pot80> all I got from that was arrow to the knee
<valoreins> and last time he was mad at me because i use the pc when he want to capture some kind of rare monster that spawn during a specific time
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I tried for a few days but no luck
<Kimori> I'm really thinking I might make the leap to getting a tablet this christmas
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> everyone is trying to sell them now for more than $99 and no one wants to buy haha.
<Kimori> cant blame them
<thelonepony> valoreins: tell him to get Guild wars II
<Stormy_> That's what I said
<Kimori> lol
<thelonepony> So he doesnt bitch about Rare monster spawnings
<Kimori> Black Friday :) thats the day I'm waiting for
<Stormy_> And then another friend told me I "don't understand economics"
<Stormy_> okay...
<oni_link> pot80: he was saying that when he read what I had put up, instead of reading the last part that said "then my free trial ran out" , he thought it said"but then I took an arrow to the knee" haha
<shana> is that silent hill 2 in novel form?
<valoreins> lol
<cachi01|creepypasta> oh my...... look at all the zelda creepys o_O
<Kimori> I'm hoping for a real good deal on a tablet that day
<pot80> valoreins I'm glad I dislike MMORPG's it dosent sound like a healthy addiction
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I might buy a 42 inch lcd tv on black friday if there are any good deals so I can turn it into a multitouch table.
<oni_link> cachi01|creepypasta: if you find any good ones, care to pm them to me?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well RaveBrony care to give me an opinion on this ? http://i50.tinypic.com/eq2xdg.png
<Kimori> Avoid walmart that day >.>
<Stormy_> :o Cool
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I avoid walmart all the time
<Kimori> lol
<cachi01|creepypasta> oni_link: long journey will be long....but ok :)
<Kimori> my relatives went to walmart last year on black friday
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I just dislike their staff.
<Stormy_> I avoid everywhere on black friday
<oni_link> okie doki lokie :)
<Kimori> they were in line to buy something and a fright broke out
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> The internet is the best black friday.
<IshFrankenPony> ohai pony pepple
<NightmareBlade> hi IshFrankenPony
<valoreins> i don't get why people got addicted by MMOs... i played many of those and got bored eventually
<thelonepony> Ohai IshFrankenPony :)
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I went to a fight and a walmart broke out,.
<oni_link> pot80: then again, console gamers think that about anything on PC
<Brovakiin|Assassin> Ohai IshFrankenPony :)
<RaveBrony> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I love it :)
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, IshFrankenPony. :)
*IshFrankenPony isn't celebrating Halloween
<Brovakiin|Assassin> ^
<thelonepony> ^^
<Kimori> I use to avoid everywhere on black friday but common...you are not going to see this stuff everyday
<IshFrankenPony> ^^^
<Everlasting_Nightmar> Howdy IshFrankenPony!
<Brovakiin|Assassin> I am to boring... :P
<RaveBrony> you should shorten Twilights head tho :P
<Kimori> I bought skylanders on black friday :D
<Kimori> It was such a sweet deal
*AJIsAwesome wishes he could, but he's at college and there's nothing going on there.
<pot80> oni_link hey i played minecraft and portal on mah pc XD
<oni_link> how so Brovakiin|Assassin ??
<Stormy_> If it ever goes down lower than $40 I might consider buying it
<Pahvi> http://i.imgur.com/liv8Q.png
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> My motto is… don't get caught up in sales because theres always going to be more sales.
<Brovakiin|Assassin> oni_link: I just prefer to stay in over going to partys and what not :P
<Kimori> Spyrorocks: I went to a fight and a walmart broke out,
<Pahvi> Oh wrong channel
<Pahvi> :)
<Stormy_> but with all that stuff it comes with I doubt that'll happen
<Kimori> did you mean the opposite? :P
<oni_link> pot80: Yeah I know, but Im just saying that that is what they think. EG: my friends
<pot80> is it odd that when I here silent hill I think of coldplay's violet hill?
<oni_link> lol
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Kimori its a joke.
<Kimori> uhh I missed it

<IshFrankenPony> There's never anything to do on halloween except Trick or Treating which I'm too old for or passing out candy, and we get trick or treaters in this neighborhood, so whats the point of celebrating anymore
<CriticKitten> So I was like "....k"

<oni_link> hewwo Saturn
<Obsidian> Hello Saturn
<AJIsSpooky> Hi, Saturn! You feeling better? :)
<Blako> gtg, bye
<xles> Dear princess Celestia... Today, I encountered my first trick or treaters. Which is odd considering we don't even celebrate halloween here. Your faithful subject, Mr xles Mcfuzzypants.
<Cades> cya
<pot80_GLaDos> man time is confuddling
<Saturn> 08,01AJIsSpooky: nope, slightly worse
<pot80_GLaDos> *man, time
<AJIsSpooky> :(
<AJIsSpooky> Hope you feel better soon, Saturn. :(
<Saturn> 08,01hey xles, where do you live?
<xles> Saturn: Sweden.
<Saturn> 08,01in Scotland, we call trick-or-treaters guisers
<pot80_GLaDos> xles: what were they dressed as?
<sonicdude558> I am getting a little annoyed with the sound in the background
<oni_link> I like that term more :3
<xles> pot80_GLaDos: Poorly facepainted something and black clothed someother.
<oni_link> lol
<Saturn> 08,01also, is it true that in the US, kids just turn up to houses and expect sweets?
<Saturn> 08,01because we do it slightly different here
<Dj_Cyber-4G> yeahs
<Dj_Cyber-4G> i heard
<Saturn> 08,01the kids need to tell a joke or a short spooky story
<Alchemist> Is my country the only one where haloween is absolutely non existant?
<Dj_Cyber-4G> yep
<Dj_Cyber-4G> well np
<Dj_Cyber-4G> russia
<pot80_GLaDos> My haloween costume consists of trowsers a shirt and a gun (helps with getting sweets)
<oni_link> Saturn: yeah, unfortunately they are a bit on the bratty side. But not all of them are like that, the cute ones or the polite ones get double treats (at least thats what Ive seen going out with my nephew)
<xles> Saturn: That's exactly what these kids did. It was surreal, they were just holding out a bag expecting it to be filled with lollies. I had a tangerine in my sweater pocket and offered them that instead. They accepted.
<Saturn> 08,01xles: how utterly odd
<xles> Indeed.
<Stormy> back
<Saturn> 08,01i'd have just given them a piece of dog fluff
<Alchemist> granted, if kids would bang on my door this time of the day I would be a bit...angry.
<Saturn> 08,01i have lots of that
<oni_link> ^
<oni_link> best trick
<Stormy> On my way home, I discovered that at least 4 country stations come in where I live
*Saturn 08,01has a husky
<pot80_GLaDos> or like avgn you could have given them a rubbish old games console xles :P
<Dj_Cyber-4G> daww puppy
<Saturn> 08,01they shed like a garden centre
<Stormy> That's not counting the ones that were on commercials when I was skipping through
<pot80_GLaDos> ^ :D
<Dj_Cyber-4G> oh yeah my new face meme http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hx9DhEREUwM/TipT62kCsBI/AAAAAAAAJAg/ij1D_xFBXzQ/s1600/37323+-+derpy_hooves+filly+meme+sock_filly+socks+will_cause_diabetes_and_various_heart_problems.png
<xles> pot80_GLaDos: I don't own things like that. Nor do I have access to lollies, or money to buy lollies with.
<oni_link> Saturn, those are my favorite type of dog ;A;
<Dj_Cyber-4G> FAVE*
*Saturn 08,01is really not a dog person

<Bronysith> Sumica: i saw a kid dressed as Ash Williams
<ekips> cachi01|scaryshit ouch
<cachi01|scaryshit> i know...
<Sumica> 00,10not bad
<cachi01|scaryshit> the screen is smaller than my hand
<Pumpkins47> So now everyone is trying to kill me to ;~;
<AJIsSpooky> People using the Scout must love this power. :D
<cachi01|scaryshit> probably i'll get a nice pc next month
<AJIsSpooky> Who's the worst person to uber in this game?
<ekips> cachi01|scaryshit same, my pc is ~5 years old now
<cachi01|scaryshit> AJIsSpooky: mmmmm spy
<AJIsSpooky> What about the Medic?
<AJIsSpooky> That would be useless too, right?
<cachi01|scaryshit> AJIsSpooky: medic has his needle gun thing
<AJIsSpooky> AH.
<AJIsSpooky> Okay. Thanks, cachi01|scaryshit. :)
<Kimori> where? me?
<Moopy> aight im back from my dinner and im full right now
<Lunar_Brony|TF2> AJIsSpooky actually, if 2 medics had full uber and they constantly healed each other, they could do a strong Uber push into a well-built nest. I wouldn't recommend it, but it is possible.
<ekips> Moopy what did you have?
<cachi01|scaryshit> lol shizu doesnt forgive
<cachi01|scaryshit> now she is ded
<Moopy> speghtti
<Cades2> yeah
<AJIsSpooky> Woah. That's pretty cool, Lunar_Brony|TF2. :O
<Moopy> with texas bread
<ekips> Mmh, loving spaghetti
<Moopy> ikr
<AJIsSpooky> Lotsa spaghetti! :3
<thelonepony> Now im hungry ;3;
<Moopy> i just ate just now
<cachi01|scaryshit> AJIsSpooky: gay luigi?
<AJIsSpooky> cachi01|scaryshit: Toast! :3
<Moopy> so thats why i came back in my bedroom
<AJIsSpooky> Dat "Brain" avatar :D
<Lunar_Brony|TF2> AJIsSpooky it would take some strategy and teamwork, but it could, in theory, let a pair of medics push with a 16-second long Ubercharge. One uber lasts 8 seconds and when one shorts out, you hit the other one
<Lunar_Brony|TF2> I've done it once before, but also seen it fail a lot
<AJIsSpooky> Wow.
<Moopy> and now im eating a frozen fruit bar right now and its so good
*cachi01|scaryshit is eating hot cakes
<ekips> I'm having a bonbon right now :3
<AJIsSpooky> I just got back from eating, too. ;D
<AJIsSpooky> *:D
<Moopy> what is hot cakes? never had one befor
<cachi01|scaryshit> :O
<alexxm> thriller time
<cachi01|scaryshit> uhmmm they are also called pancakes
<Moopy> oh
<cachi01|scaryshit> lol
<ekips> Darkness falls across the land...
<AJIsSpooky> And then the fire nation attacked....
<Moopy> also i have been drinking alot of A&W root beer here so yeah i got another pack of it over here
<cachi01|scaryshit> i used to be an adventurer like you
<otakon> damn you buffer!
<cachi01|scaryshit> but then i took a fire nation to the knee
<AJIsSpooky> And I blamed it on Dinkleberg.
<Moopy> Heh i used to play the old games back then nut i took an arrow to the knee
<Moopy> i mean but
<AJIsSpooky> GOTTA GO FAST!
<AJIsSpooky> Another great power for Scout, too. :D
<alexxm> why is heavy a giant eye ball

<CriticKitten> cachi01: But, their market strategy is so brilliant! Steal competitor's ideas and try to make them sound original, add shitloads of DRM and other nasty components, act genuinely surprised when people point out that they don't like this sort of thing.

<J_E_Smith71> Long before he sold it
<cachi01|scaryshit> he knew what was going to happen :O
<AJIsSpooky> Coulcn't you just airblast the rockets back at it?
<DerpyMuffins> How did Disney even afford Lucus studios?
<AJIsSpooky> *Couldn't
<DerpyMuffins> They spend a crap load on Marvel a few years ago
<cachi01|scaryshit> DerpyMuffins: its fuckin disney it can afford you, it can afford me, it can afford anyone of us
<J_E_Smith71> DerpyMuffins: It's Disney. Plus Lucas only sold it for 4 billion
<DerpyMuffins> ONLY 4?
<cachi01|scaryshit> it was way more
<cachi01|scaryshit> not just 4
<DerpyMuffins> Disney got it cheap
<Stormy_> :O
<Suinide> Oh yeah
<Suinide> Its that awful
<J_E_Smith71> Yes it was just $4.5 bil
<cachi01|scaryshit> well....lucas.....you are stupid
<Suinide> I hope the next time you eat it, you get ice cream cancer
<J_E_Smith71> Walt Disney Co. (DIS) agreed to buy George Lucas’s Lucasfilm Ltd. for $4.05 billion, pressing Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger’s $15 billion bet on creative franchises by adding “Star Wars” and “Indiana Jones.”
<Stormy_> :(
<IFDreebs> Wow not even 4.5
<Suinide> Kidding no sad
<RoboGerbil> meh, disney cant make it any worse than lucas
<IFDreebs> BARELY OVER 4.
<DerpyMuffins> Wait are they doing old school Disney with Lucus studios?
<J_E_Smith71> Okay I read it wrong
<cachi01|scaryshit> damn

<AScaryFluffyThing> Welcome back TOY_PON3
<DerpyMuffins> Hai TOY_PON3
<J_E_Smith71> That's about the same they paid for Marvel, $4.2 for that
<TOY_PON3> Hey everyone :)
<CypressWerewolf> In the same aritcle I read about Disney buying Lucas Films, Yahoo article, it mentioned an episode VII for 2015
<TOY_PON3> ^
<creepy_sprinkle> AJIsSpooky: http://denver.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw575_Applejack_Spooky.gif
<J_E_Smith71> It was more expensive to buy Pixar, which was 7 nil
<RoboGerbil> so does this mean we will have a deadpool sith?
<J_E_Smith71> bil
<DerpyMuffins> So both Marvel and Lucus studios for less than 10 billion total?
<AJIsSpooky> Can airblasts negate the charge from Demomen?
<TOY_PON3> RoboGerbil: Most likely
<Psycho> Ello everyone
<TOY_PON3> Hi Psycho
<AJIsSpooky> creepy_sprinkle: I'm saving that. ;D
<Pumpkins47> Hey TOY_PON3 long time no see :3

<Pumpkins47> Hey Psycho
<TOY_PON3> Pumpkins47: O U x3
<Pumpkins47> TOY_PON3: :)
<J_E_Smith71> I guess how good it is depends on what director gets put in charge of it
<CypressWerewolf> what happens if Disney sets its sights on Habro? O_O - :) try sleeping with that thought
<AJIsSpooky> Hi, Psycho. :)
<DerpyMuffins> No just no CypressWerewolf

<RoboGerbil> wait.. hasbro... doesnt hasbro own wizards of the coast?

<TOY_PON3> ^^^

<DocSane> GreenPony: How old are you and how old was this child?
<GreenPony> the kid was 7, and im 17
<GreenPony> I was dumbfounded that he called me gay in front of his kid
<CrimsonPhoenix> BREAKING NEWS Someone called another person a faggot, more at midnight
<DocSane> GreenPony: And why do you care what some little kid calls you?
<Saturn> 08,01so, um

<Kandarihu|Zoro> DocSane, this is what his father called him

<Domo> Saturn: ...I wait w--LOL

<DocSane> GreenPony: Kid, you need to be a little stronger in life.

<Master_of_War> https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/10/31/v3br1Z-1KkWhiSkZKXJvJw2.png
<otakon> AlienWarhead: eeyup

<otakon> wait you pay 20 bucks just so you can PLAY IT IN THE DAY?
<AJIsSpooky> *happens

<AScaryFluffyThing> otakon, only funny part is the music that plays cause then it's just too random
<VenHurlloween> Oh god, Slender...
<otakon> that is the STUPIDEST THING
<AJIsSpooky> otakon: No. :D
<Jmo> <_<
<otakon> then WHAT is the point of the 20 dollar mode?
<AScaryFluffyThing> otakon, i've never played it. I've seen LPs of it and I laugh at how...randomly weird it is
<DerpyMuffins> Bet you Domo only gets 5/8 pages
<Ponies47> Welp time for bread. Good night everypony :)
<creepy_sprinkle> otakon: its prolly more like a donation with an extra mode

<thelonepony> Night Ponies47 :)
<VenHurlloween> Just say to yourself while playing this: "It's just a game".
<AJIsSpooky> otakon: You unlock it when you beat nighttime. Something.....SPECIAL happens when you see him.

<SirGanjalf> Welp, i instaled Amnesia tonight. After about 10 minutes i said "nope, another time".
<DerpyMuffins> I was too scared to play Amnesia
<Jmo> Oi don't be a wuss SirGanjalf
<Jmo> That's a great game.
<RDash5000> AJIsSpooky: i see what you did there...
<Master_of_War> SirGanjalf: That's about what happened when I installed it 2 months ago...
<AJIsSpooky> :3
<SirGanjalf> that's why i said another time, not "never"
<soulrider95> I love amnesia
<Lunar_Brony> I never played it myself, but one of my friends at school got it onto a Mac and just turned up the brightness so much that it was like day.
<Phase4> ok, so the tf2 server is up without a password

<ponykat> getting hungry while waiting for slender to show up
<Lunar_Brony> walking through an abandoned mine shaft, torches everywhere, know the place like the back of your hand, sealed off every entrance and exit. Turn a corner and come, quite literally, face-to-face with a Creeper.
<Lunar_Brony> I lost 3 diamonds.

<Master_of_War> Lunar_Brony: Play Tekkit, diamonds are LOL DIAMONDS after a while
<SirGanjalf> AScaryFluffyThing: Meh, i googled him. Bastard isn't scary at all: http://i.imgur.com/391El.png rather silly
<AScaryFluffyThing> Lunar_Brony, the last thing you see is the black in those emotionless eyes as you hear the dreaded hiss and you think to yourself, "Oh, SHI--!"
<AJIsSpooky> RoboGerbil: So THAT'S how she's been living so long. :D

<Lunar_Brony> AScaryFluffyThing not really; I was having problems with my good stuff and got bored of waiting for the glue to dry. I was going to throw away the crap-tastic stuff anyway.
<SirGanjalf> Sumica: Rotate 8 by 90 degrees and you get infinity symbol - that's how long you will seek those pages.

<Lunar_Brony> Saturn Rainbow Dash because she is best pony imo
<RDash5000> Lunar_Brony: i'd have a fucking heart attack :D
<DerpyMuffins> Saturn Twilight because she had experience with Celestia
<AScaryFluffyThing> Saturn, Pinkie Pie because she's such an awesome and easy pony to get along with.
<AlienWarhead> Saturn Fluttershy her hugs would be good for my back
<Shizuka> 13vivi because vivi
<AJIsSpooky> Saturn: Pinkie Pie. She seems like a nice person to hug. :)
<RDash5000> Phase4: :D

<VenHurlloween> Saturn: Fluttershy, because when someone picks to her, I wants to hugs her!
<Lunar_Brony> and not for the whole "LOL Rainbow Dash iz best cuz she Rainbow Dash". I probably wouldn't be watching MLP if Rainbow Dash weren't awesome enough to fight in (and win) a DEATH BATTLE!!

<SpecterRush> this better sumi ?
<flutter_spin> Yeah. I saw the link.
<LuigiNut02> flutter_spin: It's cause they wanted Mario to have a strong role, ya.

<Buytoast> i'd turn on my sprinkler system on halloween
<eddmario> I still have a whole metal bowl full. In fact, I'd take a picture but I don't know how to mute the camera sound on the Galaxy SIII

<Hanako> Kojima was sick of MGS when he made MGS4
<SpecterRush> Shizuka: he didnt scope in to tighten the shell spread...
<Hanako> this won't be any better
<RoboGerbil> must be in a james bond universe.. no bullets ever hit people unless from bonds gun
<Shizuka> 13isn't that the guy from skyrim
<cachi01|scaryshit> RoboGerbil: thats because the bad guys are stormtroopers

<Lunar_Brony> I missed.
<oni_ghost> -.(\
<Lunar_Brony> twice
<oni_ghost> flutter_spin: do eet :o

<Shizuka> 13CUTSCEME: THE MOVIE: the game
<Panda-> O-o
<Lunar_Brony> but then I shot a guy 2 levels higher than me with full shield and health (somehow) and he died instantly

<Shizuka> 13this is a game?
<otakon> Shizuka: eeyup
<Buytoast> The Playstation 3 has no games.
<SpecterRush> Shizuka: this aint MGS4
<otakon> Shizuka: Uncharted 3: Among Thieves
<SpecterRush> otakon: WRONG
<Buytoast> The Playstation 3 is the world's best 600 movie player.
<Lunar_Brony> I thought otakon was leaving..
<otakon> okay what IS the subtitle then SpecterRush?
<otakon> I am
<Buytoast> 600 dollar

<otakon> ah
<Lunar_Brony> that's why YouTube was invented
<Shizuka> 13TABLE FLIP
<otakon> that title makes more sense now
<Lunar_Brony> now GTFO
<oni_ghost> Buytoast: Five hundred and ninety nine U S dollars
<J_E_Smith71> Buytoast: You mean no original exclusive to the console games? But what about Ratchet & Clank, and the PS3 versions of games like Arkham City, Lollipop Chainsaw, etc
<otakon> FOLLOW THAT WAITER!
<Shizuka> 13and now it's modern warfare 2
<SpecterRush> otakon: among thieves was number 2 though

<Buytoast> FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE AMERICAN US DOLLARS
<the_real_pony_1604> you can't catch that guy, he must LIVE!!
<Shizuka> 13when do we get into the test chamber
<SpecterRush> Shizuka: not enough explosions
<Lunar_Brony> There's going to be a MW4

<Shizuka> 13how ever will we get past
<creepy_sprinkle> wups
<creepy_sprinkle> gotta love his scream :D
<Sebiale> @Shizuka LOL
<thelonepony> :D
<Shizuka> 13and now it's assassins creed again
<Lunar_Brony> oni_ghost because people are never satisfied until a series is milked beyond the point of being dry
<flutter_spin> So did everyone else hear how Disney bought LucasArts for $4 billion and is now making Star Wars 7-9 (7th one will be in 2015)?
<Sebiale> Drake is freakin superhuman.
<Lunar_Brony> which it reached at MW3/Black Ops II
<J_E_Smith71> flutter_spin: Yep, been mentioned several times here
<flutter_spin> I just found out! :P
<Lunar_Brony> that bus has some good brakes
<Shizuka> 13three day old news
<Kandarihu|Zoro> Wow. He knows how to take a hit from a stopping car
<oni_ghost> Lunar_Brony: I lost interest at MW2, MW3 was just $60 MW2 DLC as far as I'm concerned. And COD4 will still be the best to me <3
<Shizuka> 13and we hear it, what thirty times a day now
<flutter_spin> :( sorry
<creepy_sprinkle> urprise, mothabucka
<Lunar_Brony> old news is old and, like game/movie etc... series, will be milked dry
<Shizuka> 13and now it's the bourne ultimatum
<Sebiale> What kinda of knowledge does this douche have that lets him navigate the city liek this??
<Shizuka> 13this movie just doesn't know what it wants to rip off
<Lunar_Brony> if you're going to rip off something, why not make it EVERYTHING?
<Sebiale> Movie. Kek.
<creepy_sprinkle> well its not like no game is allowed to have this kind of style if there were a few movies/games with it
<SpecterRush> RIPOFF ALL THE THINGS!!!!!
<Lunar_Brony> Because it's f*cking stupid!
<oni_ghost> Lunar_Brony: Unfortunately and Halo is well on its way of becoming the next COD since they said Halo4 is the first of the "new triology"
<Shizuka> 13that was spore's idea
<Shizuka> 13and spore sucked
<cachi01|scaryshit> well today was fun but i have to go to bed cya everypony :(
<cachi01|scaryshit> :)*
<Kandarihu|Zoro> Well, the prequels officially milked Star Wars to the point of being dry. I think there's hope that Disney will do justice to the franchise that George Lucas himself denied it of.
<oni_ghost> bye cachi01|scaryshit !
<creepy_sprinkle> bye cachi01|scaryshit
<Lunar_Brony> oni_ghost . . . did you just say "Trilogy"?
<thelonepony> Night cachi01|scaryshit L)
<thelonepony> :)*
<creepy_sprinkle> Kandarihu|OldComp: but i liked ep 3..
<Shizuka> 13and now it's mirrors edge
<oni_ghost> Lunar_Brony: Yeah they annouced it when Reach was released.
<Shizuka> 13and leap of faith into the hay bale
<Lunar_Brony> There is only one trilogy with a 4 in it
<Sebiale> What is this RE4?
<oni_ghost> a good way to sum up what happened, Bungie = LucasArts and Microsoft = Disney Lunar_Brony
<creepy_sprinkle> lawl
<Lunar_Brony> sounds 'bout right
<Sebiale> Again!
<Shizuka> 13the end
<Sebiale> And how the fuck did he find Drake?
<Shizuka> 13so
<thelonepony> night everypony :)
<flutter_spin> PARTY
<Shizuka> 13we went through that entire chase scene
<Lunar_Brony> g'night thelonepony
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight thelonepony

<creepy_sprinkle> bai tehlonpon :2
<Sebiale> @Shizuka: Entirely pointless.
<Shizuka> 13IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE MY CHARACTER HAS AGENCY
<Lunar_Brony> My question is . . . why the fuck don't they kill this guy?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Night thelonepony :)
<thelonepony> Bye Sprunkle :3
<creepy_sprinkle> well, it seemed fun, so why not
<Sebiale> Lunar_Brony: He has plot armor.
<oni_ghost> Wow, it even ripped off Metroid Other M with that do you remember me scene Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13never played it
<AdamTheCarnivorousDu> Damn, name is too long >.<
<Maid_RainBow> DAT rope
<oni_ghost> It was horrendous
<oni_ghost> Team Ninja needs to stick to well... Ninjas.
<Shizuka> 13is he french, texan, or... WHAT IS THIS GUY
<Sebiale> ROFL
<flutter_spin> OK
<Sebiale> :D
<Kandarihu|Zoro> Losing means going back and doing it over again. Winning means getting captured and interrogated. That's how story-based games are.
<Lunar_Brony> wait wait wait, this managed to rip off Other M? That's beyond low!
<flutter_spin> ow
<Sebiale> Why would you want to rip off Other M?
<oni_ghost> Lunar_Brony: Yeah that dude with the cowboy hat said, Remember Me?
<Lunar_Brony> oh
<Lunar_Brony> oh wow
<creepy_sprinkle> the numbers JASON, WHAT DO THEY MEAN
<oni_ghost> didnt need the commma
<Shizuka> 13wow
<Sebiale> ROFL
<Shizuka> 13nice of them to make the chair from graham crackers
<Sebiale> Plot chairs--they break like glass.
<oni_ghost> hahahaha
<Shizuka> 13and rope made of silly string
<oni_ghost> now for some Arkham City brawling
<Sebiale> Drake is the ubermensch, apparently.
<Shizuka> 13so is this when he gets the arm blade?
<Sebiale> I have Arkham City.
<Sebiale> Still need to get around to playing it.
<oni_ghost> I dont own it, I want it though
<AdamTheCannibalDuck> Wat
<AdamTheCannibalDuck> More baddies?
*flutter_spin still browsing rewards to buy
<AdamTheCannibalDuck> And all of them can't take on one guy?
<Sebiale> At least RE4 had means of combat OTHER than QTEs.
<Shizuka> 13it's like shizu pyro
<Lunar_Brony> Well duh. Did you se his movement speed?
<Shizuka> 13barret!
<Shizuka> 13where's cloud?
<Sebiale> Now who's this joker?
<RoboGerbil> and now, more fighting that god of war
<oni_ghost> flutter_spin: any accessories or peripherals you want?
<flutter_spin> I'm thinking of getting a new headset...
<Maid_RainBow> STOP HITTING THERE
<oni_ghost> flutter_spin: do eet
<Lunar_Brony> It's just . . . gah. He's whipping his arms around with ridiculous acceleration.
<the_real_pony_1604> he has to have the strongest forearms ever
<Sebiale> I love how, no matter how banged up he is, he can always do extreme parkour and acrobatics. :)
<flutter_spin> I'm browsing dvds. I already chose Avengers for like 2,400
<oni_ghost> lol
<Sebiale> Bullets in my torso? No problem.
<Shizuka> 13nolan north IS altair IN assassins creed: drake's deception
<Lunar_Brony> why buy The Avengers when you can torrent?
<RoboGerbil> get your assassins creed climbing simulator out of my uncharted
<Sebiale> Some people like supporting companies. :P
<Shizuka> 13he's awful spry for having just been in a ten minute fistfight
<Sebiale> Nolan North???
<AdamTheCannibalDuck> Do what you want 'cause a pirate is free
<CECtheRonin> Uncharted?
<flutter_spin> Look. The only way my mother will watch a movie is if I buy it or it comes on tv 5 years later
<Lunar_Brony> where did this ultimately strong rope come from?
<CECtheRonin> Also, HAPPY NIGHTMARE NIGHT, EVERYPONY!
<AdamTheCannibalDuck> Ohai CECtheRonin
<Sebiale> Happy Halloween
<Shizuka> 13ah there's the arm blade
<Lunar_Brony> ohai CECtheRonin
<flutter_spin> Besides Lunar_Brony , I can now say I actually bought a dvd :P
<Shizuka> 13now he just needs to find a hay bale to jump into
<oni_ghost> flutter_spin: same here and netflix
<flutter_spin> ok... maybe not :P
<the_real_pony_1604> I like the water fire fight coming up
<Sebiale> A ship graveyard apparently.
<thegt90> hope u had ur tetnis
<Sebiale> Because people just like to leave tons of expensive metals lying around in the ocean.
<creepy_sprinkle> lol
<flutter_spin> Besides, I have to spend it on something.

<Sebiale> I love how fought gravity for abit there.

<Gold_Demona> new battery time?
<Misha> We really should stream Sadowrun Returns once it gets released
<mutterguy_> I've actually just been in a shadowrun game that's ended
<Misha> Ended? Impossible
<mutterguy_> Modified so that there no magic 9simply high tech)
<mutterguy_> well it's ended because the GM said we're done
<Misha> I see. But magic is kind of the deal with Shadowrun
<naturesfury> wseriously was expecting the msp sound there btw
<naturesfury> mgs*
<mutterguy_> yeah but so is high cyberware and hacking. there was lots of hacking. The Driver/ hacker's catch phrase was 'OPEN ALL THE DOORS'
<Hanako> It would appear I'm no longer the only shoujo.
<Misha> Did you ever play the SNES game?
<mutterguy_> nope
<mutterguy_> hell I didn't even really know about roleplaying until I got Baldur's gate
<Misha> It plays kind of like the old Fallout games. The creator of Shadowrun (pen and paper) is remaking it for PC
<Misha> 2D, turn based and plays like the old
<Alchemist> ooh, are you familiar with shadowrun novels?
<Misha> Never read them but the SNES game is based on Don't Deal With a Dragon
<mutterguy_> I mean my dad played this thing called D&D and I would have to stay over with my Dad's friends kids
<Ryunosuke> HMM
<Ryunosuke> sorry
<Hanako> unless you're a different Misha, I guess
<LightTrooper105> eenope..
<Ryunosuke> shadowrun returns... is it more like the snes version, the genesis version, or the crap microsoft version?
<mutterguy_> but until Baldur's gate i didn't really acknowledge it
<Misha> SNES/Mega Drive
<Ryunosuke> assuming its a game of course :p
<Misha> Let's forget about the Microsoft version.....
<Ryunosuke> well the snes and genesis/mega drive verions were... different as well :p
<Misha> It is a game. See previous comment
<Ryunosuke> i must research this then
<Misha> The creator of the pen and paper Shadowrun is remkaing the SNES game for PC
*Hanako shrugs and gets back in bed
<Misha> 2D, turn based, plays like old Fallout games
<Ponies47> Good morning :3
<AdamTheDuck> Good morning Ponies47
<mutterguy_> are they updating the System material to 4e?
<Hanako> Ew, 4e
<Misha> Don't know
<LightTrooper105> halllo Ponies47
<Misha> There is a kickstarter with everything you need to know
<mutterguy_> Hanako 4e Shadowrun not D&D
<Hanako> mutterguy_: oh okay
<Misha> Google Shadowrun Returns
<Hanako> 4e d&d is pig disgusting
<Misha> Last time i checked they had 2 million dollar
<Ryunosuke> okay
<Ryunosuke> so seeing as they have deckers, I am correct in assuming they are not using the latest shadowrun rules? :)
<mutterguy_> Hanako i have similar reservations. D&D shouldn't be a board game...
<Alchemist> I wonder how easy it is to abuse kickstarter...
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> take all the stuffs(damn you fallout)
<alexxm> what do you mean Alchemist
<Ryunosuke> it does look good though
<Misha> Ryunosuke: I don't know. I honestly haven't playe pen and paper Shadowrun for like 11 years
<Alchemist> alexxm: I cant help to think, what if someone announces a bullshit project, one he doesnt even intend to do, but gets hundreds of thousands of dollars donations.
<alexxm> Alchemist surely they have to produce an end product though
<Ryunosuke> same here, its been a while, but i know that ... hacking and the matrix hasa gone under significant changes
<Misha> Shadowrun Returns is due january 2013
<Ryunosuke> well since the SNES/Mega Drive versions
<Misha> It would have been awesome if it would have been released on 21 december 2012 *wink wink*
<Ryunosuke> what year is it set in is my question :p
<Alchemist> alexxm: yeah, one that can be made with minimal effort and minimal budget and looks nothing like the one product they announced
<mutterguy_> yeah they use wifi now
<Misha> The Awakening
<Alchemist> alexxm: I dont know what kind of follow up is there from the part of the site.
<Misha> I would guess 2051 if it based on the SNES/Mega Drive game
<mutterguy_> c'mon Awakening, mutate me to a Dwarf...
<Misha> ^
<Misha> Well we still got 2 months to go before the manastorm
<Alchemist> I would settel for a half elf physical adept
<mutterguy_> 4e is currently set in the 2070s
<Ryunosuke> hmm
<Barb|HipsterHippy> Holy shit.
<Barb|HipsterHippy> Walking army
<Ryunosuke> if the primer is to be anything of a setting, its set before Dunkelzhan (sp?)
<Alchemist> Dunkelzahn died in the 2050's right?
<Barbetos> Who?
<mutterguy_> Well he is dead now...
<Ryunosuke> oh wait
<Invi> moin everypony ^^
<Ponies47> Hello Invi :3
<Alchemist> Barbetos: a character from the Shadowrun rpg
<Invi> dat Ponies47 ^^
<Ponies47> Dat's me :P
<Ryunosuke> no wait, its after dunkelzahn, but they didnt mention him?
<Ponies47> Dat Invi :3
*Invi plays a silly sound
<Misha> The SNES/Mega Drive game is actually pretty fun. I look forward to Returns
<Jmo> Allo Invi
<Ryunosuke> Big D, was the first Dragon President of the UCAS :p
<Invi> hai Jaymoo ^^
<Alchemist> Ryunosuke: though not for too long
<Misha> UCAS? The megacorp?
<Ryunosuke> the country :p
<Misha> Oh
<AdamTheDuck> and a late hello to you Invi
<Alchemist> Misha: United Canado American states
<Misha> >Dragon president
<Alchemist> iirc
<Invi> hai that AdamTheDuck :)
<Misha> We all know how well that will go
<Ryunosuke> basically iirc, the us was split up into several smaller states
<Alchemist> plus the native indian territory
<Invi> iirc?
<Jmo> If I remember correctly.
<XAX> MUTTERGUY
<mutterguy_> Current president is ex General Angela Colloton
<Invi> hai XAX ^^
<mutterguy_> XAX
<Ryunosuke> Shalish-shide, and other elf nations, amerindian nations, aztlan, etc
<AdamTheDuck> Hello XAX
<Ponies47> Hi XAX :3
<XAX> mutterguy_: http://www.hoyts.co.nz/Movies/details/My_Little_Pony.aspx Did you see? :O
<Alchemist> were there two "countries" for the elves? One in jamaica, one in ireland?
<SpeccyRush> Sumica: can you go between games without causin explosions
<mutterguy_> NewSuperBronyU|Zzzwait, wat no wat HUH???
<Ryunosuke> Alchemist, there was one up in washington and one in northern california iirc too
<mutterguy_> *xax
<AdamTheDuck> XAX, .-. Movie?
<Ryunosuke> salish-shide was up in washington, you had to go there in the mega drive version :p
<Misha> I only played the SNES, bro
<XAX> mutterguy_: I presume it'll just be a few episodes based on party stuff. But still. I want to come up to christchurch on the 25th to watch pone on the big screen now.
<Invi> how is he still alive?
<Misha> Ponies in church? That's it, im becoming relgious!
<Invi> you show ponies in church?
<Jmo> >_>
<Invi> well... we actually watched simpsond oone time in church :D
<XAX> Misha: Christchurch is a city name.
<SpeccyRush> LOOK UP YOU IDIOITS
<Invi> oh
<Invi> uh no. too lazy ^^
<Misha> That's a rather confusing name for a city
<alexxm> Misha when did that happen
<mutterguy_> XAX I guess we shall have ot make this a meet up!!!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Well i'll go and try to sleep, Goodnight everyone thanks for the stream Sumica
<Invi> nighty TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<alexxm> bye TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Alchemist> Ryunosuke: I need to re-read all the shadowrun novels, I cant remember the geography and many many other stuff.
<Ponies47> Night TheG....
<Misha> Alchemist: Would you recomend them?
<XAX> mutterguy_: I'll definately try my best to get along to it.
<Misha> Alchemist: Right now i am busy reading A Song of Ice and Fire
<mutterguy_> but yeah, Christchurch was named after the Christ church college in oxford if you're wondering. We've recently had a big quake
<mutterguy_> *well one and a half years ago
<JRP2234> i know
<Barbetos> That one random guard who saw that just throught out his flash of whisky
<XAX> Still tidying up though.
<JRP2234> i saw the shit tha got damaged
<Barbetos> threw*
<Alchemist> Misha: The Dragon Heart trilogy definitely, Black Madonna is great, LX-IR, Technobabel. all good books
<XAX> When I woke up during the earthquake, I legitimately thought it was just huge winds banging the windows.
<mutterguy_> JRP, just explaining to Misha
<JRP2234> should i continue the cupcakes song remix or sleepeis?
<XAX> Then dad rushed in and told me to GTFO of bed, because the earth was quaking.
<XAX> ._.
<mutterguy_> that's was my thoughts about the 7.1 too.
<Barbetos> augmenteded eyes
<Misha> Alchemist: I'll look them up, thanks bro
<XAX> The second bigish one (the aftershock that actually caused deaths) happened literally as I sat down in my computer chair one lunch time.
<Misha> I just realised. In decmeber i have been watching FiM for 2 years
<JRP2234> whos seens james rolfes youtube channel background recently?
<Alchemist> Misha: oh and Burning Bright too. From the ones I mentioned all are world building books, so they dont deal with the average joe stories (except maybe for LX-IR)
<mutterguy_> yeah it took me 20 seconds from waking my eyes to getting up and under the door frame. ~4:35 is a god awful time to be woken up
<XAX> ikr.
<Alchemist> JRP2234: James Rolfe = AVGN?
<mutterguy_> and THEN we had got in the car because we weren't sure where it came from and thought there could've been a tsunami (I live close to the sea)
<XAX> oh true. i remember the tsunami warnings.
<XAX> well, precautions.
<XAX> none actually happened :p
<Alchemist> JRP2234: ohai random OC pony in the background :)
<Misha> Tsunamis? You chaps live on the west coast?
<mutterguy_> yeah because the epicentre was around Charing cross (actually close to my Grandada's old farm)
<mutterguy_> reast coast.. this was back in 2010
<mutterguy_> *east
<XAX> a 1 and a half metre tsunami did come to shore at the bay here at some point a year or so back lol.
<LightTrooper105> im back o.o
<mutterguy_> that was probably from japan??
