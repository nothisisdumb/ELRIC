Hey someone help me out! If I buy "Total War: Medival 2" NOW, do I still get the 'King of Scotland Cape"? O_O
to Da
or email
I have no idea.
Y U DISAPERA
I want iiitttt
:<
dat backround music
night guys
Democape.
Also, is it only 'Gen' quality that is untradeable?
Nite {swa...
And the reason was this:
/me voms
:o
like many promo items
TL DR
yours is fine
Well, most of them, IMO.
O_O
oh come on, the vps is down AGAIN
I can still buy one of those games and get it
this is unacceptable
Time to A-Rank Grand Metropolis
Some OC's I find pretty creative. It's just that the majority are incredibly horrible.
Which one? Medieval II: Total War or Total War Battles: SHOGUN?
yep until october 1 it seems
http://obstacol.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Didnt-READ.gif
Most OC's are utterly terrible.
^
ohh wait both give you the same
^
my oc is an alicorn
just kidding its a unicorn
well if you only want the item go for the cheap one medieval II
You can somewhat draw but you do have some anatomy problem
i was searching for bad OCS and i found this one. but imo its good and creative http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/299/2/1/mlp_oc_pony___gear_hawk_by_metadragonart-d485lei.jpg
around the age of the cmc

Fluttershies are land-based too.

It goes up because you don't have a supervisor anymore... Damn trick questions. :P
Thats all I used
00,02Chrysalis, the idea is those 120 hours are spent with an instructor, but anyone with a licence is legally able to instruct
brodash, G'day
00,02and there are a lot of morons out there with licences teaching other morons
00,02thus the chinese wisper of driving knowledge continues

Aliens? :3
Carpenter is a special effects genius
the first 3 alien movies were all shown over the summer. I don't think The Thing has been played though
FULL MOON TOMORROW
but i want to see trainspotting and tron!
To be honest the effects were the only thing I liked about The Thing. The movie itself didn't impress me
damn
Aliens 3*
yep, 3 was played for the trilogy event
Ahh trilogy
oh, Ranjid rettet die Welt hits the theaters soon :3
I just want to forgot I even watched 3 and 4...
Bleh, 3 was like the first only shittier and more cruel
forget*
I know how about we watch my Gopro clips of me fishing in the ocean on a kayak?
They played the extended version of all of them. 3 did was not good enough to justify an extended version
*I know how about we watch my Go Pro clips of me fishing in the ocean on a kayak for 20kg TUNA?
it was awesome. Tara Strong cosplayed as Twilight
and?
And they brought in a bunch of non-pony actors to do a VA rwading of Boast Busters

Oh and guys, have some humanized ponies http://fav.me/d4r821l
The thing about furry its a bit sexual.
it's a fetish of course it is
No in my opinion its not
Everytime I hear fetish all I can imagine is Saturn
though there are some people that just enjoy furred character because they're cute
That's fine for you
but let's put that subject into a close
sensitive subject
