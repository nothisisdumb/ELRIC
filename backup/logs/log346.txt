<DocSane> I ran a pony panel at AWA and made a joke about Twilight being the best pony in the program guide description. Someone actually complained about it at the gripe session.
<PinkiePieAddict> of Animusic, that is
<pony_2247> Octavia would approve even though she plays bass
<Geneva> It's just a really wacky instrument.
<m0rxx> I haz no lag :3

<SOAPisBronyMW3> :D :O
<ZombiePY> =P
<TheGPT> I remember when the first of these videos debuted on the Sci Fi channel. Amazing.

<pony90920> Fluttershy is best pony

<InfinityDash> The way they move in unison is terrifying
<Starssk1ttles> 2 K views holy shit
<Typhlosion> Yep it sounds like something from the 1st Spyro game
<Cheezer> Indeed season 2 has been great so far, but there are some things that is annoying me just alittle bit but not much about it. For an example that all the ponies has started acting like Pinkie Pie is annoying and that they don't appreciate her company. Like how used Pinkie Pie as a way of getting the truth out of Applejack as Pinkie Pie was some horrible thing they just couldn't stand hanging out with
