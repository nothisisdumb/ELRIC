The Thirteen Ghosts of Scooby Doo is the only series I like

Scrappy is best pony.

05hmm
Phase4, he showed up in some cartoons as well but not much
I think he was in the original series
05i never saw thsi ep
he was in Scooby Doo and the Ghoul School Phase4
LadyCanary: I remember that series. :O
otakon: The more recent series have much better designs for Velma.
DocSane: agreed, the newest one she's actually ATTRACTIVE
08,01Panda: it's really not; i had it zoomed in when i drew it
DocSane: much less lesbian-y designs
okay bbl, TL2 is calling me
Wrek: neither have i, but i know of him from Scooby Doo and the Cyberchase
The one with Mama Kass was my favorite >w< since, my mom and I like the Mamas and the Papas ^^" heh.
08,01that picture used 4 layers
05but yeah
05all the bad movies
05and later isntallments

WOOOAAAAAHHH!!!
/me ignites age debate once more, burn baby burn, aging inferno~
Kipkat07_USAF: night
she acts very mature, but not like an adult
17 is good
yeah i vote 17
I vote 20's
wrek i dident know you like pink floyd
/me grabs his junk. "WWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAHHHH!!"

so, how about that bronz
PINK FLLOYD!
Pinkie would be 15 or sumthin.. the way she acts
Mum walked pasted and asked 'Darkside of themoon?
cowvarkian: ?
Wrek: May I post a link here?
AJIsHaunter: tis a band
=3
oh, i thought wrek was taking his clothes off for a second.
OohShiny: nope they are all almost the same age
and Fluttershy is a year older than pinkie, so 16
It ain't YT; but something EQD put up
Are we discussing pony ages again?
OohShiny: fluttershy is 18
OohShiny: pinkie 17
too many typos theres
all the ages
wrek: dat tshirt can i borrow for 10 years
I imagine Twilight, Pinkie, and Rainbow Dash are the youngest.
.....
all the fanon
13http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_meem3scvuY1r00waro1_500.png
I have a completely non-sexual crush on Fluttershy.
I believe Rarity has 18 too
Shizuka: http://www.hottopic.com/hottopic/GiftGuide/ForYourPopCultureJunky//My+Little+Pony+Ditzy+Doo+Hoodie-120535.jsp :P
Shizuka: ?
is*
cowvarkian: well fluttershi being 1 year older than pinkie is canon
cachi01: I know
fluttershy*
rarity is thinking about maridge keep that in mind
Twi, because she would have been advanced a grade or two as she was tutored by the princess.
cachi01: but why would any of them be teenagers?
Pinkie and Rainbow Dash because I think they got their cutie marks sooner than most.
Shizuka they all just saw the internet
boofire: she's just acting like we'd expect
cowvarkian: i vote 17
Because anime.
They're all over 18.
nope
dat hoodie <3
Kurra: objection
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Spotlight Remix/Foval Music: General Mumble - Babs Seed / ) Babs Seed (P1K Cover) feat. Meelz / I Just Don't Know
Rarity, Fluttershy, and AJ are the oldest, although I suspect Rarity may NOT be the oldest of them all.
I vote all of them be 20 somethings
Wrek: "Dat ass".
wouldnt Rarity be in her mid to late 20s minimumif shes thinking about marriage ?
Fluttershy is the oldest
Yeah, they all have jobs, prolly file their taxes already, many are paying mortgages or whatever no?
she is all motherly
oni_link: No. Some women get married while still in college.
dont base their age because of their actitude
pls
even she's scared of almost anything
it has nothing to do
we dont even know if they pay mortgages, Kurra
DocSane: but not all go to college right away
This is amazing <3
XD
Lol, Wrek.
Kurra: yet, she's still a student
xD
/me applauds. Yaaaay~
I think Rarity isn't the oldest because of the age of her sister.
Kurra: plus twi, aj, rarity seem to be supported by someone
Haha, GoPro ad better than this song XD
pinkie too
...RUN LIKE HELL
Wrek did the "dat ass" face a minute ago.
Twi is still a student.
Aj works for her family and herself, pff
^o^
trixie_squirtle: her parents pay for her house
AJ lives with her family and helps support them.
OohShiny: yeah so they might not be over 18
http://derpy.me/lhCTY :D
Pretty sure the Apple home is long-since paid for.
Rarity works her own store. Goodness knows she has to file a million taxes and expenses and deductions, oh gosh
I think the mane 6 are all teenagers
almost adult
we dont even know if they pay for their housings
but yet, need to see a lot
OohShiny: rarity might be like 20
Rarity's prolly getting screwed over by small business tax law too :[
*Raises lighters**Shizuka raises her fireplace*
05sit back
didnt the writers saying anything about their age?
05relax
cachi01: I agree
05enjoy the pure awesomeness
05that is this song
05if you can
I'm pretty sure they're at the least high teens and at most very early 20's.
13<3
05max your speakers
cachi01: but the others are younger
I wonder if she could file hers as an LLC c.c
Wrek: I'll do that instead of getting into this pointless disussion
oni_link: Yeah, I've been trying to find some pony wristbands.
OohShiny: yeah she is the only one with a job
They're adults at the very start of their adulthood.
OohShiny: besides applejack
OohShiny: but its her own business and AJ is family business
AJIsHaunter: I really want some, why does no one make them??
Rarity has to file as an LLC
oni_link: I hear people can find them, but I never can.
So, suddenly we started talking about pony ages... so, how long does a pony live?
Unf, dat bass <3
OohShiny: 100000000000000 years
AJIsHaunter: yeah same here
She just HAS to. HAS TO! *lounge chair*
OohShiny: well apparently granny smith founded ponyville
OohShiny: A long time, based on Granny
05drop the redundant age discussion.
*her and some settlers
is not redundant c.c
05it is
i vote egoraptor made it
it really is
RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN
It's actually pretty good for thinking
it's cool to imagine how old they must be!
/me runs
05it is redundant.
twilight got darker :D http://derpy.me/RBAUM
05end of discussion
*makes a rainbow* IMAGINATION!
Because then you relate your own age to them and their experiences, and wonder what they think of their lives so far :)
Can we just...enjoy the music >_>
btw anypony knows of a place i can read the mlp comic?

The 1 millionth comment on /mlp/ was something horrific, mainly about rainbow dash. *shrugs*
UNDERBITE!
Mike: I just ignore the p--n.
Reddit is anything but organized
KrazyNoobs: what was it?
dialysis
lets not prompt him to ask
crap
i want to --- in---- ------- ----
Buytoast: At least they automatically replace their pony episode links if one goes dead
KrazyNoobs: Im pretty sure its became a meme because they said it so much XD
Buytoast: Way more organized than 4chan.
Ok I call bullshit.
KrazyNoobs: lol
KrazyNoobs: i dont now whats scarier, what you said, or that i know what you said.
U cant just reattach a medical tube like that.
I know, oni_link. I enjoy it, but I keep myself from saying it here.
MustEnfoldAll: it's a cartoon for one
KrazyNoobs: lol yup
MustEnfoldAll: for two, dialysis would leave him VERY weak
Sorry, I kept it censored.
KrazyNoobs: dont worry i get it xD
Awkward...
:D
This is PG channel, so I just stay appropriate, unless asked. I'll hint to it if you need to know it

KrazyNoob: You sound like an anti-gay-rights person.
otakon: "clop" is the name :P
xD
trixie_squirtle: o_O
clop is fucking hard
KrazyNoobs: Sadly some folks unaware of the rules come in and say that during new episodes. Bet they probably get kicked/banned
Please, conversation over.

otakon17 still wimnter where I'm from
FACT: CN dosen't have the broadcast rights to Megas anymore
i miss when toonami was on cn.. ._.
I remember when CN first started and showed "Space Ghost: Coast to Coast" and endless, endless Scooby Doo.
cannot unsee that :3 video :D
Toonami is back on
not on cartoon network on adult swim..
J_E_Smith71: Then who does?
00,10toonami is back but it's realy just rebranded [AS]
It's ain't Toonami unless it's on after school.
haseo348 but it is on. Its on Adult Swim now on adult swim
Yeah
I mean I like AS
It's just an Adult Swim anime block.
Haku1013: thats what i ment
nyeh
DocSane: and looney tunes and all the old cartoons
Bit the anime offerings have been slim as hell
i ment i missed it when it was a part of CARTOON NETWORK... not adult swim..
All the old stuff was moved to Boomerang.
If I heard right, it's not as good as it used to be
08,01hmm
Ben 10's on boomerang
Seriously why haven't they picked up PS&G or Black Lagoon?
Darth Fluttershy?
I see a dark tunnel with a bright light t the end.... oh my god... in the light... it's.... it's.... fluttershy...
08,01so i think my boyfriend might have broken up with me, but is too scared to tell me that he has
classic pokemon is on boomerang...
I have no ifea
Black Lagoon is good otakon17 :3
otakon17: Least Toonami has Sym-Bionic Titan
08,01he's not been responding to any of my messages for a week

Ass his kick
In that order
J_E_Smith71: oh god that show was awesome...
FUCK THAT WAS LOUD
08,01yeah, i intend to
to bad they cancelled it...it started going down hill during season 2...
08,01i may need to go to the netherlands to do it, but one way or another, he's gonna get a piece of my mind
I remember when my texts stopped getting returned; and when she generally had no time for my interests or feelings...
08,01even if it's a calm, understanding piece
or like, cared at all
NOT THAT IT STILL BUGS ME OR ANYTHING :[
lol
J_E_Smith71: It does? Nice
No idea what this song is
dat cadence
Stallion_of_War: thats why you call them and tell her what the flying fuck is going on...
Okay that was weird
AT 3 AM IN THE MORNING
The only GF I ever really cared about broke up with me when I worked on ONE school project instead of hanging out with her, ONCE
Net split?
haseo348: I wasn't in the mood to kick plot at the time; I had strong emotional attachments
yet
HoodyKazam: bullshit eh?
Hello?
Stallion_of_War: understandable...
oni_link: She also didn't like my friends :I Either way, yeah bs
08,01otakon17: too busy to respond to my increasingly concerned messages asking him what's going on?
Creepy ass music
but i did that to my x....i called her at 3 am and told why the fuck she hasent been answering my texts and shit...
HoodyKazam: seems like a dumb reason to split DX
dis music
08,01and too busy to take my calls...
otakon17: LOUDER
NocturnalBlade: :I At least she moved this year and things aren't awkward

RaveBrony: sorry thought u was going
Is it safe to discuss the trixie episode now/?
Ill be leaving in a bit ^_^
SpadeKyurem[R]: Yep since this morning
SpadeKyurem[R]: yep
sure flies by sumi
What im getting is, that brooch had alicorn powers right?
I suppse
Why the fuck did Celestia not destroy the fucking thing?
*suppose
Because reasons
SpadeKyurem[R]: It was called the alicorn amulet and had nearly unlimited power
Not alicorn power
Oh, is it time for r/mylittleconspiracy in Bronystate?
Who the fuck just leaves a artifact that powerful and not destroy it
I think it's all magic
Maybe she couldn't find it?
08,01hmm, while sb sets up, imma test out my setup
She's at least a 1000 years old and has a Kingdom to run?
SpadeKyurem[R]: Probably can't be destroyed
13BUT
13it doesn't have fire
AttackWithHugs: do what?
Maybe they plan to bring it back? Who knows
SpadeKyurem[R]: The One Ring
Right...Im chalking it up to Celestia being fucking lazy
It must be thrown into the fires of mount friendship
as usual
13or could you load a fireplace onto the offline playlist :3c
Either that, otakon17, or only another alicorn can destroy it
the only thing the amulet couldnt beat was the art of trickery
Inb4 Zecora uses it to gain music and goes on an evil rampage? lol
00,10give me files Shizuka
weylinish|Blarg: Eeyup hell I wouldn't be surprised if that would kill or hurt the alicorn doing it though
yay fireplace forever
I had sympathy for trixie untill this episode
All I see trixie being is a bitch who cant learn her lesson
08,01jeu wipergone2
otakon17, and we have all these ponies and unicorns delving into the occult
I actually enjoyed Trixie returning.
WHY
Eeyup
shaddup, trixie is awesome
Shes a fun character, lol
Not saying she isn't a good character
Well the fact trixie learned nothing from her first incident annoyed me
SpadeKyurem[R]: well she learned from the second and apologized
Pride does strange things, my friend
I liked how Twilight beat her by outsmarting her rather than suddenly gaining new power out of the blue
yeah its the first time we saw her limits actually
Well pride goeth before the fall
J_E_Smith71: same, felt better than twilight being tons more powerful lol
Her way of living was taken away from her, and she wanted revenge. O.o At least she 'sorta' apologized
:D
Hey it wasnt twilight's fault he rlife got wrecked
you guys have a good site to watch the new epis after theyve aired?
It was fucking Snips and SNails
Blame those two fuckers
Yeah
I didnt say it ws Twilight O.o

Like these offline pictures, better than the buffer circle
Also I dont get one thing from the Babs seed episode
Why the hell was applebloom making a pumpkin float?
00,10soon™
Because pumpkins, man!
Isnt that all they fucking do?
SpadeKyurem[R]: Fall harvest? Maybe picking something from the fall crop?
because, an apple float is jsut what the competition would expect
Also, it was called the Summer Harvest Parade IIRC.
AJIsHaunter: Doh
Harvest crops usually include pumpkins, if I remember.
AJIsHaunter: Only saw the ep twice, didn
ddn't remember
SpadeKyurem[R]: They made a gold apple at the end

Hey Shizuka , Poly just asked why Beetlejuice was ineligible for voting
It is?
Also, I didn't really notice that bad of a quality.

I checked the spreadsheet and Beetlejuice was in red.

Oh wow, wouldn't have seen that coming.

I never would have thought Beetlejuice to be an A movie
It's by Tim Burton, so... :/

I think so?
Whoa what
11,02Good day for a brawl of firepower isn't it gents?
yes
SuperBrony64, what's with pistol-only?
Righto
it's easy getting 10 awards in a row, especially if they have the same number points for the required unlock
SuperBrony64: yup, keep up the good work mentlegen
Legshot? ded
..
/me tosses tumble weeds into chat
mm, I feel like im starting to get better with the gamepad
He didn't even try...
also, I love the WII U
how many people are on that ship?!? jeez XD
I could take it to school and play BO2 without a tv
nope
Major SuperBrony!
lol
QBAlchemist: SB throwin a parteh
11,02Polydunami: Yay ^-^
11,02Time for a fun parteh \:D/
Oak leaves all around :3
SuperBrony64: does voice chat only work with a headset or something??
sadly you cant take the gamepad away from the Wii u to far
:I
On a Wii U?
11,02Boltasar: I think so, yeah
darn
then I still cant talk to you...
Wait, can the Wii U support the microphone?
mmm
11,02yes
Wait, this is a Wii game :(
yes
a wii u game
Is the Wii U just the gamepad and like an add on to the wii?
Oh, it's on the Wii U now.
is that the MP412
?
Revolver is crummy, it seems.
Revolver? Really?
Its the executioner, i think it shoots shells
honestly, why are they saying hostile with weapon
like honestly
RawketLawnchair: it was in MW3 as well it if is the one im thinking of
Maybe some hostiles carry kittens
Some carry cookies and candies
No, SuperBrony64 , you are not Ocelot.
is dat jaymoo here?
SuperBrony64: what are ya doing using the shotgun pistol, it has no range
Do you get something special if you use only the weapon you spawn with?
and by that I mean drugs
maybe they are only carrying spears or whips ... they dont specify
Maybe.
<:
this game looks pretty good on the Wii U
Jmo died
Didn't you hear?
jaymoo is always lurking
:I
dat jaymoo on
he lurk, lurk, lurk
I lurk. Your argument is invalid.
I lurk big-time
damn
was that a Pikachu emblem? I like that about this game and the first one
Good god
in fact, it was close to a year before I even started chatting with you guys
Utter domination
Back when this game wasn't Modern Warfare XD
but it looks fun at least
What'd you need aniderp?

SuperBrony64 change your emblem to JRP
NocturnalBlade: not for superbrony it seems :D

Ugh, achievements.
achieves make games boring
hahaha man you are owning these guys with that pistol XD
good lord ... how powerfull is that pistol?
And that fist
very apparently
very powerful
XD
pistol is OP lol
inb4 SB is using a rapid fire (according to these dudes watch)
pistol op, remove from game plz
oni_link: no, SB is OP!
hahaha
SB makes me want to get back into COD QBAlchemist ;3;
I had to be an asshole today on my TF2 server
oni_link: ditto
QBAlchemist: what plaform do you play on?
weylinish|Blarg: y u do dis?
I play on a micspam server, and we have a rule where you don't overspam
oni_link: currently 360. my PS3 is away at the moment XD
people did that, and I muted and gagged everyone but myself for a good 10-15 minutes
QBAlchemist: nice, Im getting it for the 360 to play with friends
weylinish|Blarg: lol
3 people ruined the fun for everyone else
dat brohoof
and I don't have full ban/kick powers, so I had to drag two mods in
lame
not to mention people were trying to get around the chat filter with their stupidity when I let them chat
oni_link: ill keep an eye out for you online then :D
Im gonna be an admin for some surf servers on CS:S
Kyrgyzstan, huh?
:O:O:O:O:O
QBAlchemist: yeah, we should play sometime. (that is, when I get the game haha)
I've been playing on Sporcle way too muc :S
*much
My goodness, they're killing a lot. Your teammates are either not shooting enough or real tactless
probably the latter
my skulltag(doom2) crashed
Hi everybody :)
SuperBrony64?
hello The_TCR_Engineer
I'm afraid he quit right away
wow
that was fast Polydunami
Wha?
Huh?
Oh, you mean the guy?

Physics of war, STILL not a reality in video games

/me flips tables at the thought of Juggernaut
FAL is single fire lol
sure you have a fast enough trigger finger for the FAL SuperBrony64 ?
I know I do , that was my gun in MW2 <3
and the G3 in COD4
/me sits on jaymoo
o.o
/me pats aniderp
Wow, ragdoll lol
used to get suspended for playing with kids who would file complaints and send bad rep XD
Whoops
"he has a rapidfire!" "mods!!" blah, blah, blah XD
Couldn't you report someone for being too young?
Polydunami: Nah, but you could report them for misconduct
Well, that's a little better
oni_link: hated that, it's not my fault you suck at shooting me in the back and got turned on
today is the 3rd
SpeccyRush: IKR XD (this game is really bringing my competitive side out, I want it now)
Hai
Polydunami: yeah, didn't always work, rep had to be put down to a certain percentage for it to actually matter and me being a trash talker back then didn't help my cause either XD
Hey there, DitzyDerpy15
hi DitzyDerpy15
dayum
the whole team was on you SuperBrony64
but honestly I could take my WII U with me and play BO2 campaign at school
Why isn't he trying? ;~;
idk, im getting a little upset HoodyKazam :/
protip when playing cod: you start to tryhard and all the fun is sucked out of it
SpeccyRush: Meh
just be aloof
Go with the flow
^
SpeccyRush: or opponents take the fun out of it when youre not trying :P
I like the league play ;~;
All the more reason to keep calm
never tried the league play out, what is that btw?
It's like...Why're you getting mad at a game?
exactly what it says on the tin
and yeah, I play to have fun nowadays
Overflow?
Funny how you say when you're a tryhard SpeccyRush :P
Oh, never mind
that*
SpeccyRush, tin?
moojay
pls
go
You play some placement matches and then you're put in a league
HoodyKazam: so like arena in Reach
Wait, are your team the big number?
oni_link: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin
Na.
I mean, the kill total
You lose or gain league points by winning or losing
SpeccyRush: ahh
I haven't been playing much of it though...
HoodyKazam: I would play if I owned the game
oni_link: Tis a fun game
HoodyKazam: yeah , I tried it out when a friend brought it over. Gonna try to get it soon but on the ol snoozebox360
Jmo I wouldn't call someone runnig around with a shotgun against smgs and the like a tryhard
You're a tryhard Speccy.
SpeccyRush: not even if it was the SPAS in MW2 with grip?
SpeccyRush: Tried that, win everytime :I
^
...please tell me that isn't SB64
nope
well that's mw2 oni_link one of the most broken cods out there
it aint
its not
thank deity in all its forms
SpeccyRush: lol true XD or the spas in the first black ops as well
shotguns in blops weren't that great
only reason the spas was considered good was cause of the suppresor
yeah. that and it was the strongest shotty, the others kinda sucked. and am I right in saying that SMGs are always OP in COD?
final kill yayz
congrats Boltasar
11,02Boltasar: Moo :3
ugh, I muted that idiot...
11,02ikr
You did like the Babs Seed episode, right?
SuperBrony64: VEE
MOOOOO
oni_link: I considered the stakeout better honestly, and kinda although blops smgs were abit meh... except for the ak74u
jaymoo my head hurts ;_;
Take some medication to sooth the pain?
or leeches
soothe*
SpeccyRush: omg yes <3 Aks74u is my favorite. Only two games it was in iirc were COD4 and Black Ops right?
SuperBrony64: did they erase another message of yours?
11,02no
This is mystical
oh that was the old message then, my bad

UPlay?? really? I think they're taking advantage of Nintendo now

Well, there are ways
I never did like Uplay's UI, kinda hard to navigate
All those Miis

13HWAT!

I wonder when Apple officially became more evil than Microsoft-
well, I'm out. Later
Well jobs was a mean boss, is the rumour on the street
At least he kept the cap on the shit company. Now it's just spilling everywhere.
Jmo: pfft, nah when the first iPod touch and iPhone came out.
SuperBrony64: moo
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Nightly Roundup #514
jaymoo messageeeee
At least Jobs didn't wanna sue every frekin person that opposed them.
Not sure when they started with strange lawsuits and semi-immoral factories
Jobs wasn't in the legal dept. I think
I think they sued crazy things then too
Not as much as after he departed.
13CLOTHESLINED
no, but his economics and--legal dude took over as CEO didn't he?
Something like that.
11,02Because $18,000 goes a long way
I never liked how Apple buys things and says the made them...
13ramen works wonders
SuperBrony64: SOUTH PARK
or when they do something that everyone else does, its better because its Apple >.>
Apple has agressive echniques
/me slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
So do I.
11,02oni_link: People say that about their computers they built and that's perfectly acceptable.
the price anda gression is the only reason I don't like them
the machines themselves are ok, decent
13uh sb... apples and oranges there bub :/
/me lays down infront of Jmo and weeps
my head hurts-
Cause I was busy kicking your head in while you slept. :>
13it barely looked
13wat
;__;
Goaticorns demanded it.
The betreyal stings!
11,02Shizuka: DOUBLE STANDARD
SuperBrony64, the difference is the money point, I figure, built computers are usually cheaper, as for better or not-depends
built as in home-built
I wouldn't have such a problem with OSX, iOS and their hardware if their advertising wasn't so full of itself... That and most (not all) of their consumers are ass hats that don't know squat about what they buy
automaticall assume Apple=best
13macs start at like twice the cost of a PC built to the same specs
There are good macs out there, just cost too much
yeah, the price and advertisement/marketing is the issue
*automatically
11,02Shizuka: But Apple computers are better, so it's justified.
13wat
...what
run SuperBrony64
no that's just the point, they're the same
run fast
13psst apple hates flash
/me throws cookies everywhere
13bronystate is built on flash
13THEREFORE FAIL
lol
the apple vs flash was because of a monopoly desire, wasn't it?
yup
monopoly is very tupical of evil companies
if Apple can't own it, its dumb to them
Night Work? Have a good time? uhhhhh....uh oh
/me over dramatizes with evil laugh
no wonder why i cant get on chat here when im on my ipod
or "illogical" or a "waste"
13cause adobe is dumb
SuperBrony64: mobile flash was always bad
they just came to light and killed it off before it layed eggs
Only in 4.1
*laid
I still have flash on mine
removing it is a mistake because of backwards compatability
SuperBrony64: you dident awnser
you can still get the APK for it if you look around for it
but its pointless
its dead on mobile
perhaps
13PEGGY PAWNCH
11,02Apple is best visionary.

Hehe

you lie shit
pfffft
13you are not a very good liar or salesman sb
SuperBrony64: get windows
I want to go Linux soon but have Windows on a dual boot or VM or parallel
I am, sadly I guess, a windows lover
used linux when I was young, but-
tried it again on virtualbox, and it doesn't suit my needs anymore
Too bad Windows doesn't love you.
Forever alone :>
11,02BronyState is Mac Compatible!
Oh windows love me, I feed it money
That it is
Guess wat Vivix
13REVOLUTIOOOOOOOON

SuperBrony64: over charging causes battery life to go down, and if charged for too long they can leak
11,02oni_link: True, but I can always buy another battery :)
SuperBrony64: over time it'll make their battery life dwindle, over charging causes that to happen at a much quicker rate
11,02I'd rather not run out of battery life while playing a game.
So they are replaceable ?
11,02Yeah
AWESOME
2+2= cow

And here I am having JUST woken up ;A; hearing all this good food and shit

00,02don't think i'd enjoy it
00,10Start building your space station Phase4
cya
00,10or start topogrophy scaning
00,10I think there is a sat scan mod
00,02no mapper unfortunately
00,10oh you dont have that mod?
Phase is there multiplayer in KSP?
00,10it works with mechjeb
mica is your text pink?
or is it just me?
00,10no you just have stupid seting on your irc

Sweet! I have to go download it now
/me slaps Gold_Demona|cooking around a bit with a large trout

I contributed to the curry!
Woo!

How to properly build a rocket : Place main engine , add fuel tank ...... pour milk all over it , smasheggs!
lolol
00,02i'll make the boosters detatchable
But do you have enough solid fuel boosters?
I mean, if 3 boosters are good, shouldn't 6 then logically be better?
dun dun duuuuuuuunnnnnnn
ok..? rockety rocket is it time to launch?
mica lets go bowling
00,02looks good
Phase4 y u no rainbow
Then its Mun or bust?
also Phase4 y u no bed
/me hits JRP2234 with a bowling ball
When is this rocket gonna launch
One time I was watching the KSP developer's stream and asked if they were gonna eventually make it possible to take the Kerbals skydiving like Felix. And they said yes. XD

Never mind. Not space.
00,02the kerbals seem to be having fun
to space?
00,02hmm
00,02need music
XD
That was a shorter flight than expected
Patcher's being a pota :<
00,02Gold_Demona|cooking, it does that
00,10yeah Gold_Demona|cooking it always is
00,02wobble wobble
Spaaaaace.
00,10needs more duct tape
So just keep trying until it works, or should I wait until later? :P
00,02this rocket does not want to stay in one piece
looking good so far
00,02also lost my main engine
O rly duct tape
00,02was not suposed to lose that
this will end in laughter and tears
/me wraps duct tape around Sumica
You have 3 more so no biggie phase4
Duct tape fixes everything
Phase What games do you have.
00,02Fl00t4sh41, kinda needed that one though
00,02pony_624, far too many
mica have you seen my host name?
00,10you should see it when my camera stops following the aircraft Phase4 the craft jumps to like mach 4
hi Nittany_Discord
Say 5 games.
To space.
00,02so
WAIT TO THE MOON?
00,02need more engines on the upper stage
00,02and i need to not loose the main engine
00,02and i need to get the fule lines right
00,02we will not be going to space today
;_;
Nuuuuu!
Phase4 can i has some help
phase u made me cry
00,02hmmmm
00,02what to do for music
00,02JRP2234, depends
Explosion tiem.
:O OH MY GOD THIS IS THE GREATEST BOSS EVER :D
lol
I'm going to try again later. This thing just refuses to work. =/
You know what im gonna cheat THIS INSTRUCON TO GET A GOLDEN SWORD
*Wood*
Lololololollololollolololl
00,02phantom engines
Phase4 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logitech_G15 me lieky
00,02looks like a hideously complicated keyboard
i think
my internet derp
i just want it cuz it works with doom
/me laughs at JRP2234 lol
Lets do this
Next stop MUN
00,02those engines still dont want to stay still
Space?
and then...BANG!
00,02wobble wobble
A little jiggling don't hurt anyone
00,02this is not good
They only need to be stable long enough to run out of fuel
00,02so those are the wrong engines
D:
They worked, didn't they?
00,02i wont have enough fuel
00,02lost an entire tank
That way its not a problem if it snaps off
00,02Fl00t4sh41, the bottom tank exploded
A few explosions never killed anyone
SPACE!
I SEE IT
They're just part of getting into space
just make it so the explosions propel you into space
I'm loving the music they added to the game. :>
Wouldn't be any fun if nothing blew up on the way
Its not that much speed you are short of an orbit anyhow
00,02i'm running on fumes
00,02not sure how far behind the stream is
about 5 seconds or so
00,02the upper stage is full but i need that for landing
00,02weylinish|Blarg, woah, really?
yep
00,02was expecting more
Not gonna use a parachute to land?
05so...
05i overslept today
Fl00t4sh41: parachute is for home landing. Need the rockets for Mun landing
05i woke up when my class started
05only got one class today
05and it starts at 13:30
05:|
ah
:c
00,02clean up some of the ships
00,02Fl00t4sh41, landing on the mun
STARE FIGHT
00,02as demona said
>_>
Never thought you'd actually make it to mun with that rocket
wats bbbbbffffff?
No offence
00,02est burn time: N/A
00,02thats reasuring
.
tiny wobble
TOBBLE
TOBBLE TOBBLE
TOBBLE SHALL NOW BECOME A NEW, SCIENTIFIC WORD
00,02stupid focus change
00,10hmmm, a KerbalKon
00,02sence when was this thing left in orbit
Boring
00,10big rocket
00,02oh well
Now I think we're 8 seconds behind
00,02loving the manouvers system
Phase4 how do i protect my nick again?
00,02 /ns help
00,02damnit cat
00,02not now
00,02i'm busy with rocekts
Phase4 i cant seem to find the command
i already did that
hmm its not there
JRP2234: what are you having problems with?
00,02that is a nice orbit
its not teliing how to protect the nickj
THEMOON
00,02i'ma try landing
as in setting a password for it??
00,02ooo, i can see a moon arch
Do you see Luna anywhere?
00,02not landing ther
00,02Pinkie_Kittie, not yet
I think you'll find her when you land.
i think the command is /ns register [password] [e-mail]
but you have to /ns identify [password] when you change to that nick or else it boots you from that nick to an anonymous nick :0
Pinkie_Kittie: But Luna is on Equestria's moon. This is Mun. D:
hmm
Unless Equestria is actually on Kerbin. >.>
Luna can go on any moon :3
if the moon is luna, and the moon is made of cheese, does that mean luna is made of cheese? :0
Cheesy Luna?
00,02secretly luna is a cheesemaker
Ryunosuke: Luna really IS Chrysalis!
Her special talent is cheese
and cheese accessories
Wouldn't her cutie mark be cheese then?
00,02this is gona be a close landing
I thought it was suspicious how she was abscent when Chrysalis was unveiled
The moon is cheese
00,02need to save as much fuel as possible
and they are both shape shifters
00,02shoulda bourgh some lights
She loved cheese so much she accidentally made way too much for Equestria to hold, so it got thrown into orbit and now we call it the moon. :D
there protected
you know... Fl00t4sh41 that... makes some sense as chrysalis is swiss cheese as well :)
:D
And I'm pretty sure her name was Helga before Luna
So the rocket is landing on cheese?
Helga the Cheesemaker
Ryunosuke: IKR
night yall
JRP2234|Zzz: just remember said password :)
g'night, JRP
also Phase4 is a giant tuna sandvich for heavie
00,02SO
00,02we're on the mun
Nice
Cheese time
Do you still have enough fuel to go home?
Yay! =D
Phase4 is Sandvich!?
Or will the Kerbals be stuck with Luna?
Dat face
Mun
night phase cook
00,02unfortunately he cannot spot luna
Maybe Luna is hiding?
00,02so
00,02hometime
00,10need more flood lights
00,02we come back with bigger rocket later
00,02Sumica, indeed
00,10you know they have lights now yes Phase4?
00,02not sure if enough for munar escape
Time to go home. :>
00,02Sumica, yeah, used them on another rocket
00,10I think I need to fresh install my game with no mods
00,10they seem mostly redundant now
this game needs a luna mod :3
00,02WOAH
00,02that was close
00,10just snough
00,0223 out of 720 units of fuel
do eet
Niiice
failure isnt an option
So that fueltank blowing up wasn't a problem at all
00,10correct, failure is a result
ah windows classic theme so much nastolga
Free-fall to Terra!
00,10Kerblin
forgot to add the firma :<
00,10comeing in realy fast
makes me wanna listen to david bowie - space oddity
The situation demanded it :v
00,10so have they added heat yet?
00,10guess not
so where is Phase going again?
what is this?
to the moooooooonnn
Jageman: Kerbal Space Program :D
I think the chute went off to early
Actually he's just returning from there RoboGerbil
Back
to high up for any drag
What game is this O-o
Kerbal Space Program
why am i still here
/me slaps JRP2234|Zzz around a bit with a large trout
/me yells at JRP2234|Zzz to goto bed
Oh gosh :l
00,02real re-entry is nowhere near this calm
ok night yall...again
Your going to hit the water! D:
PLACE PLACE WHOS GONNA ROCK THE PLACE PLACE
Phase4: well, simulating re-entry is kinda hard.
HAY GUYS
*Ded please enter the message if you alive*
Now the real question is, did you remember to have a ship waiting for you to splash down
gtg guys bai
is it just me, or does that planet have a very thin atmosphere?
or will your astronauts have to swim home?
better get the paddle
Where did the parachute go
00,02Fl00t4sh41, well the kerbals have yet to invent boats
Better start swimming then
its a long way back to the launch base
wtf
they have space rockets but no boats?
00,02i like how i lost a huge ammount of fuel and the misson worked anyway
00,02Jageman, yeah
00,02no cities either
00,02just the space program
lel
becuase priorities, man
sense that does not make
00,02so
Phase4: That's because they have distilled their society down to its most awesome component and done away with the rest
00,02this next chalenge involves rendezvous
00,10rocktry is the first tech kerbals discovered
00,02Fl00t4sh41, is best society
Truth
how can their society support a space agency without cities?
00,02this looks like a good starting point
00,10entire population lives underground
underground cities?
I gotta go AFK for a while. Need to get my groceries before it gets too dark
05zerging indar ftw
Make some good explosions while I'm gone Phase4
00,10yay
00,02k
Phase4: is this the demo?
00,02Jageman, nope
That's why they're green. That explains everything, Sumica
i love the giant batteries
00,02lol, the ion drive isnt even listed under propulsion
00,02max engine power: 0.5
DADADADADADA DADADA FUCKCY FUCKY ITS A ROCKET THEN WE GO TO SPACE WOWWAVVBAIA WOASDKZOWWWWWWWWWWWW
00,10silly Phase4 you forgot topic
00,02oh derp
00,02Sumica, can you change?
i think im going to get this game.

What is that?
00,02SO

ITS BEDANGLEDANG
Phase4: can you make a multistage?
00,02yeah
you could try that
00,02yeah, thats not going anywhere
00,02multistage isgo
00,02actually lets try more fuel first
Phase, you blowing up kerbals again?
Phase4: you almost overheated your rockets before
wobble wobble go the rockest
rockets*
He's now blowing up satellites
00,02THAT DIDNT GO SO WELL
00,02sry caps
00,02caps lock is the precision cont rol key
00,10oh man this is gonna be good.
00,02PERFECT
lol
success!
you should put more farther down
00,10just need to play the game enough to be able to use cel phone
00,02staging time
Phase4: i think 1 of your fuel lines goes the wrong way
im not sure
00,02this will explode spectacuarly
wibbley wobbley a bit
it's spinning a little, too
how far till apogee?
where are you going anyway?
00,02somehow successfull
00,02Jageman, jool it seems

hi MLP_Brovakiin! Hi Snow!
Damn straight.
Moving hastily onwards.
lol
I wear the pants in this relationship.
I thought dabi was your true love, Jaymoo.
I have several true loves, shhh.
nope Meanwhile we are still here :D
/me cracks BladedWings in the head with a cinderblock.
So, how's the weather?
I don't know what's going on anymore.
Jmo: i hope you wear a belt with that pants or else it will fall of your very legs
AssaultWithEmbraces: Me neither.
Syl would prefer the latter.
/me flails around laughing
00,10Silly Meanwhile, falling back on spelling errors like I care.
i never know whats going on AssaultWithEmbraces ^_^
Cat won!
Silly Sumica, getting butthurt because artists can't do their research.
/me throws tables
I should get back to drawing whatever I was going to draw
Vivix: Cats always win. :3
/me nods
They don't win with me.
big cats do!
You lie.
hi
Nope.
And then, they mount you
I'm Australian, nothing wins with me.
i do
Does australia have big cats?
Not even spiders?
The spiders Mayjoo, the spiders.
Na, not even the spiders.
Jmo loves spiders
You don't Snow :P
I will never visit
i do
who is gonna stream
I still have that spider family living on my ceiling.
because if you don't let me
Think they had another baby.
00,10wait you though I was buthurt, try harder and perhaps I will be.
i stop fallinf everywhere
falling*
Sumica: who is gonna stream
You wish Snow.
Given how much you seem to care, I don't think I need to.
Ié been tripping all over the world now
Vivix: i can't be everywhere at the same time
/me rocks in chair
Maybe I can bribe the weather gods
Someone give me a word for describing a changeling, besides cheeselegs
Trout.
Shapeshifters
Swisslimbs.
Swisslimbys swisslimbs.
Cheddarextremeties.
I was about to say a very dirty hole-leg joke
Swisslimbsys*
Okay, anything having to do with cheese is out
00,10Keep humoring your self Meanwhile
And shapeshifters.
Vivix: i can try to come to norway and trip over some rocks there.
Shapebender.
aww
AssaultWithEmbraces: Deceivers?
Move on Sumi, I did.
Changeling- hm-
AJIsHaunter, that one is in forr consideration.
Now, I can't find my pencil. Great.
/me hands AssaultWithEmbraces a pencil
I was gonna say something there.
But yeah.
/me thorws a drawing tablet at AssaultWithEmbraces
AJIsHaunter, is it a mechanical pencil with 0.7 lead?
aaargh so much typo today ;-;
/me is finicky with herr pencils
her*
/me loves pencils
AssaultWithEmbraces: ...........yes?
/me slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
I use a blue and red sketching pencil when I sketch
You love anything that'll touch you.
/me violates fish
Of course!
See?
/me slaps a trout with a large Jmo.
Ha
BAHAHAHA.
/me calls a sea pon
This took a weird turn.
pony*
Nothing is ever weird enough!
My preferred pencil are PaperMate Clear Point with 0.7mm lead
Oh the perspective of that context.
but this is not 18+
0.7 is what I liked I think, in school- but now I'm more fond of like--2B and HB wood pencils
*whispers* not yet
Or those "clear" mechanical pencils. 0.5mm to 0.7mm lead preferrred. 0.3mm is too thin and 0.9mm lead is way too thick and smears easily
pencils, srs bisnis
I don't mind those wood pencils, they just smudge crazy when drawing or taking notes with.
so picky.
God.
yeah they smudge a lot- we used eh
This is why we can't have nice things.
Festspray? English?
spray the drawing afterwards, so it sets
setspray?
shut up Jmo. I like my pencils the way I like them
You're just as picky about trout Mayjoo.
anyway yeah, not touching the drawing is hard-
Trout is serious business.
Milky boy.
Vivix: I can't spray anything I draw. It irks me
Milk is serious buisness fishface.
I did it in school, but never done it since-
Milky boy?
I love trout.
if you put on too much the lead would run
i love you too Jmo
Don't question that name, you'll never understand it.
Now, ink pens....either PaperMate or Bic
Blood for the blood god, skulls for the skull throne, milky milk for the Khorne flakes.
/me can't stand the way fountain pens write
my favourite ink pen was a split-tip- aaah, wonderful to write with, never really drawn with ink though
Jmo: Unless I find the information on why he's called that.
RICE FOR THE RICE GODS.
You never will.
really? I love split tip, similar to fountain isn't it?
That's what you say. :P
That information is stored within archives of the oldest codex in the history of mankind.
Trouts for the Trout god.
FYI - Femme Fatale = Shizuka, Vivi, and Luna :)
hi
Vivix: I wouldn't mind fountain pens if they didn't feel like they'll rip the paper every time I use them
Hi, kimplix.
speaking of Shizuka
Fireplace!
FYI the term Femme Fatale in common usage means a harlot.
how is everyone today?
Fire~
Fine, kimplix. Talking about pens and pencils
kimplix: I'm okay. How about you? :)
AssaultWithEmbraces, oh yeah- they tend to be sharp. I had one with a rounded ball on the end, and the other one was super sharp
Only picky people are.
13fyi the term meanwhile is "let's cut away from something interesting to listen to a self important blowhard"
/me flails around
i meant in case anyone was wondering who was in that particular pic
But Shizu, you haven't said anything yet.
i'm good. thanks AssaultWithEmbraces and AJIsHaunter
noun (plural femmes fatales pronunc. )
an attractive and seductive woman, especially one who will ultimately cause distress to a man who becomes involved with her:
Zing.
Yes, i am very picky with what I use to wrte with, Jmo. Is that a problem?
Yes it is fluffeh. I want nice things already :<

DIGIMON OH MY GOD
awesome
I feel ya Somethingwithponys , it was the first fanfic I heard, left an impression
i sense a digimon stream
woo digimon
must be sumica :)
oh god. not digimon
Digimon, how far into this are we?
kimplix: I like Digimon. :3
kimplix: bye^^

Meanwhile: Too far to keep count?
Island files
/me fans Snow'
sounds like a tax heaven
/me slaps Snow around a bit with a large trout
Jmo
Yes?
i am your trout.
AJIsHaunter:
Right, still early then. No superdnacombometaldigivolves or whatever.
AJIsHaunter: hi
I keep hearing the english dub of the Digimon theme in my head to this intro.
Yes, wipergone2? :)
Damn you, dubs
AJIsHaunter: :)
Well, I don't know if you really want to be.
AJIsHaunter: i am a sea pony
00,10dub?
00,10what dub
Livestream ees naht loading!
Also, Hi.
4kids one probably?
kick
there is no english dub. go way
HAH! digimon
English dub? Never existed. <_<
Yeah the 4kids dub. That's the only one I've heard so farr.
i remember those days with the movie and such
Dubs don't exist, like bigfoot and teamplay on CoD.
Milky milk on the other hand
of Digimon? Yeah I saw it as a kid, Norwegian dub
Meanwhile: And 7 year olds on TF2.
Hey, I liked the 4kids dub. But I can get used to the original Japanese version
Meanwhile: i play CoD with teamplay.
its moments liek this when i'm happy i'm german and didnt have to grow up with 4kidz
hai everypony /)
i remember picking up the video casset of it
Milky milk on the other hand is a totally one hundred percent real thing that exists.
£3 it was
AssaultWithEmbraces: I didn't mind the dub either.
the german one holds very close to the original
Totally does.
and it was new
And now I ask a question in which the answer would requiregreat thought and highest intelligance, in an elaborate answer,
what's this?
digimon
wtf is dis shit
turtlegod98: Digimon.
actually it was Saban entertainment
intelligance
yay digimon!
which... wasnt THAT much better than 4kids
Your question has already been made invalid.
a bit like pokemon but with talking monsters
rtns
i always laughed at him because he looks and acts like my brother.
and no Pokeballs
isn't it
Pokemon are cuter, though
But they have Digieggs in like..the second season with Davis and them
true

/me slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout

I don't know enough about pokemon to point out my favourite block of species, but- I prefer the more natural and such
rainbow dash not canon
HavokOC: not meh, get it
'Nawa nawa swiming in the ocean. causing a commotion, cuz they are so awesome'
>can't follow because it can't swim
normal pokemon are the only good pokemon
what is this anime?
...If he can't swim why did he agree to being mailed out to sea in a crate.
You havea giant bone, USE IT TO PADDLE.
Small oversight much.
It's not that hard.
Bwahahaha
this isnt pokemon i know, is it digimon?
Piyo
What pokemon is the pink psy one? Related to Umbreon?
Espeon?
Jmo: Think so.
OMG YES
Yeees, that one is gorgeous
my fav
God I still know the name. I need to hurt my brain.
so cute
Espeon is the name yes
dat nawa
Jmo: Watch some soap operas?
Jmo: I've been out of pokkymans for years
I still know the first 400 names by heart
i have a poster here with all 368
Good for you.
I have never played pokemon
386*
I just watched some of the series, and think they are cute
00,10I think I can recall them if I had a rap >_>
I can't even remember the G1 Pokemon anymore.
Read some feral fanfics though
y'll abvoisly never heard about ninetails
Cause you didn't have a childhood Vivix.
How many are there now? 700+?
Sumica: i could link the rap if u want xD
/me pushes Jmo
I never played a Pokemon game,ever. Is that good?
Liar.
Hehe
Serenity: I think 640+.
what's the next mlp episode title? anyone know?
!cd
Episode 6 of season 3 "Sleepless in Ponyville" airs in 4 days, 21 hours, 24 minutes, 58 seconds (Dec 08 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
I like the pokemons, some of them, but I never got into- eh- you know the games
AssaultWithEmbraces: It depends. Do you play RPG's much?
AWW YEAH!
Vivix: Other way round for me, hated the anime, loved the games until Gen 4
tried one a wee while back, and it was a bit too jrpg, and I really just kinda wanted to play as a pokemon, not capture them and force them into battle
i hope it's a scotaloo episode
aah
scootaloo*
Jyou is the worst possible leader at the moment.
Black 2 looks interesting, I hate the actually pokkymans themselves, but I can always transfer
Dat engrish.
Engrish is best language
the main problem with the pokemons eries was the absolute lack of story and that it was the friggn same every episode, season for season
I have Black 2, just haven't played it yet.
I was recomended black 2, but I don't own nintendo things
AJIsHaunter, I've never played an RPG before. Like, eve.
pokemon is pretty much the CoD of anime
I only briefly watch the show, but I collected the cards
AssaultWithEmbraces: Then I don't think it'll interest you that much.
now adays I just think they're pretty, and I think the only reason I know their names are fanfics
> Digimon streaming >Pokemon talk in chat
Dark_Horst: How? How did you put that out so well?
the only same thing was team rocket want pikachu, they do pokemon battles, walk all the time and loads of other stuff
YokusaHHart: that always happens B)
I loved the show and the games, stopped watching the show when Gen 4 showed up, still play the pokemon games to this day.
00,10lol, dont the leader normaly have his folowers do the work?
AJIsHaunter, not like it matters because there's so many of them nowadays. Who needs 600+ Pokemon? Like, seriously.
I was just thinking that.
dem faces
AssaultWithEmbraces: I have no idea, to be honest.
guess that pokemon - ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
1501 was enough as it was.
Serenity: had my good part in BF vs CoD discussions as well. gives you practive B)
anyways, Pokemon is a pretty cool guy, eh captures monsters and doesn't afraid of anything
251 was the absolute limit
AssaultWithEmbraces: One of the things that keeps people playing is usually the online battling.
yeah but the diversity makes it fun
pokemon collector enthusiast?
._.
Though some of gen 3 was pretty good
AJIsHaunter, online battling?
I like that there's so many, because a lot of them- I don't like to look at
God what has been started.
guess that pokemon - /)*(\
that face is so fukin' creepy
These people seem totally legit.
kimplix: ikr
in all seriousness, I love the games, not go keen on the anime
AssaultWithEmbraces: The game allows you to connect to online battling via a wi-fi connection and lets you battle people all around the world.
I like the pokemons, not to keen on game or anime-
Meanwhile: inb4 they're part of a cult?
Vivix: a problem that didnt exist with the first 151^^
As of Gen 4.
05omnomnom
after that batch they looked more and more like toys
AJIsHaunter, like Brawl?
Dark_Horst, that might be true- when did the Umbreon and Espeon come in?
AssaultWithEmbraces: You could say that, just works much better.
gen 2
meh
Vivix: no idea. but i know they werent in the first wave
bakamon
seen creepier
AJIsHaunter, eh
NOW DIGIMON?!
Vivix: generation 2
there is a pokemon MMO in the works
I wonder what it looks like without the sheet.
Gen 2? Okay, well- They're probably my favourites, but I haven't gone through the list
Gen 5 was actually then gen that got me backinto Pokemon.
<for kids
05and thats why you never trust an altarboy

Anime is weird as hell.

BladedWings: he is realy a BAKAmon

You know.. that has got to be traumatizing for that little kid.
"As long as he evolves properly"
But the question is, will he remember you?
What happens if they evolve improperly? Do they turn evil?
NO, THANK YOU, THAT WOULD BE TOO EASY!
Jennai
AssaultWithEmbraces: yeah, I think it was covered in a later episode
Was the second evil digimon Etamon or Myotismon?
Dat Grandpa
00,10suddnly old dude
thats convient
who could that be?!
AssaultWithEmbraces: i think so...remember what happened to agumon when he became SkullGreymon?
I want to know
BladedWings, not really.
Sumica... may I pm you a video for intermission?
Meanwhile, I think it was Etamon? I'm not too sure.
Eatamon?
the english lyrics make no sence at all

Angewomon appeared in the movie i guess.....feel free to correct me if i'm wrong
yea it was Etamon...loved that guy lol
shivering? jacket? dafuq

AssaultWithEmbraces: Tai wanted Greymon to evovle so bad that he went nuts
someone kawaii me
BladedWings, so he cracked under pressure?
00,10Tai over fed him then put himself in danger to force an evolution
BladedWings: Tai was ALWAYS LETTING his pride get the best of him
or most of the time
AssaultWithEmbraces: what sumi said lol
I have to rewatch season 1
Sumica: What would happened if he tried to force him to evolve?
00,10dark evolutions

magic logic: "lol i dont need to explain shit"
Deutschland ist ze best land.

Next to Uncle Sam's Freedom World.
00,10think of the cartrages as over clocking

Dark92Enigma: Certain clients allow you to see quit/join messages, IIRC.
why can't i do that...?
Just download an IRC client
that allows it of course.
I'm using lightIRC, so I can't see the messages.
Only problem with using other IRC programs is you lose those lovely pony emotes :'(

i havnt watched this show in the longest time

Heya again GilDash :)
/me glomps Panda ontop of GigabitHarmonie
nice wallpaper
Dat Panda

Wait GigabitHarmonie is streaming? YAY! :D
w
t
f
GilDash, nope...
who is excited for the next episode
7You need to internet-stalk everyone and bully them into coming back.
This is Earthworm Jim levels of funk.
7I've already done that like three times.
indeed
7they're not listening to me anymore
Panda: Yep. I've had one hour sleep so far and it's the busiest report week of the year! \o/
GilDash: Ouch. :<
what makes you think anyone would listen to me though?
/me noms Panda's fluffyness :3
sleep is for teh weak
And you don't get much funkier than Earthworm Jim.
I honestly think I'm going insane right now. XD
GilDash, I know that feel. Coffee, tea and determination works well.
Also
Stream boats.
I don't talk to anyone from the "old days" anymore unless they already come in here
hello gunthler
sleep is for teh weak
Obey boat.
/me shakes his groove thangs.
lol
Panda: I'm not really a coffee person though. I can't handle hot drinks. :S
OH GOD IT BURNS
7You basically mothered the bunch of us for a couple years :P
I wonder if there's iced tea in the cafeteria...
GilDash, cold coffee is better
Ze soldier sez:
...?
actually, sleep really is for the weak, for the longer you stay awake the more weak you becomea nd you need to sleep to become strong again, so yes, sleep IS for the weak
BOAT
The hevy sez:
Panda: To be honest, I think I'd be lucky if they have cola, let alone iced coffee. XD
exactly
POOt
:o
huh
Oh, for a second there, I thought that you were gonna stream another yule log.

GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASP!

"Don't swear at the new people" "Be nice" "Don't post NSFW"
GigabitHarmonie... what is this...
Yeah, seems accurate
This isn't helping me think I'm any more sane. :D
Why does that chick sound like derpy to me.

Lol, you can hear when GigabitHarmonie gets mentioned.

Panda: No, no, no....
dafuq
AJIsHaunter|Homework: why not?
Just say GigabitHarmonie's name. The PM noise is on the stream.
I'm about to give up on SF for this reason.... It may not be as bad as darkspyro, but it's still a bunch of teenagers who can't seem to grasp simple guidelines
