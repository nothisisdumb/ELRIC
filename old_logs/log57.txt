<Tyranico> bewbs?
<Combustiblelemons> Sexual content = "Plot heavy"
<Wolfcat22> ...
<chedduhr> and so this one time...at band camp...
<Axel_Foaley> It's good nudity, not bad nudity like Borat.
<Maxaminus> Has the movie started? Is that why the stream is black?
<Kaezone> Those PLOTS
<ChaoMing> 0RATED-RP FOR MAGICAL PONIES
<sotha> Isn't this like your favourite movie or something?
<NightmareMoon> Keep watch, that was an exact ban

<Hipster_Brony> 8and this movie is FUCKING HILARIOUS
<WhatPayne> Eww... girls

<Aponymous> Meh, whatever, I've probably seen worse. I sat through that Last House on the Left shit.
<Elky> borat was stupid
<Hobo> Borat nudity? *shudder*
<DesSur> Wow, BLACK Dynamite!
<Dman> 0If you wnat RainBroDash I can recommend one of my favourite fanfics too

<yyy> Hi, I'm Malk.
<NynashamnPole> holy crap. FOUR chapters of Past Sins appeared on EQD during todays movie night.
<RainbowFox> lol @Maxaminus
<interior_gummy> i used to wonder what nudity could be
<Axel_Foaley> This movie is extremely black
<Combustiblelemons> Borat nudity was alright
<luc> are there any ponies in this movie
<BubblyDoo> Loved Last house.
<mib_k2ne9x> this better not be like deathstalker
<Hipster_Brony> 8and everything you see thats "bad" is supposed to be that way
<SirSprinkles> 6It'll last until about 10:30 PM XD

<Axel_Foaley> nothing but black it seems
<Elky> mib: HERESY
<RainBroDash> it's my mate and his twin brother's birthday, I'm getting wasted on monday
<yyy> Black Dynamite's dick is Twilight Sparkle's horn.
<HaveTumorWillTravel> We've had Borat, Combustible?
<RobotPinkie> Warning: This movie has no ponies.... to my knowledge.
<DJMidli> its probably just some 12 year old rtard so the exact ban is more then enough
<Hipster_Brony> 8like boom mics in the top of the shot
<pony_yay> tHIS FILM IS REALLY BLACK
<Ray> 02brb
<ChaoMing> 0I didn't know this movie was full of niggers, look at all the black. ;) Nah, just kidding guys...

<Razyn> Hipster_Brony, how exactly will the lotto go tomorrow?
<Ghosties> 4We're gonna hold LOTR on August 26-28
*ReticentSmolder Ghosties was waiting patiently inside the cottage on a futon, eagerly awaiting SilverMane. They had planned a romantic night out and dinner had been wonderful, but SilverMane had mentioned he had left something at home and wanted to grab it before they met at Ghosties' place. With a knock on the door, Ghosties called "its open," and Silvermane trotted in.
<DJMidli> badly. in this case Shaico
<nah> @chaoming wow rude
<SirSprinkles> 6We just need a reason to do this, since we haven't yet and people have been demanding it.
<Applebloom> NynashamnPole Ah just said thaaaat @.@

<SilverMane> Ghosties <3
<BitZero> Yes we do.
<DR_Robotnik> I approve of DJMidli

<interior_gummy> i vote for epic sax spike
<Dee_Twenty> Does OOO take as long to get to the good part (read the part when the rider henshins up and kicks ass) as the other Kamen Rider we've been watching? If so this would be a good time for me to go grab a drink.

<Dman> SUBARASHI
<DSNesmith> the beetle themed one
<NewDCD> 9...I should probably redraw DCD Sparkle, even if I didn't make it
<Purple`Prose> OOOS! OOOS! OOOS! OOOS! OOOS! COMEON!"
<Kaezone> lol
<HaveTumorWillTravel> No, DSN, but I imagine there were a lot of them, considering how popular it was
<mib_b73i9l> AMERICAN VERSION OF ANYTHING SUCKS
<DSNesmith> ugh, what was it called
<Darf14> Kamen Rider, saw it before but never heard about it.
<NewDCD> 9DSNesmith Yeah you mean Masked Rider
<NewDCD> 9it was SO BAD
<Dee_Twenty> Beetle Borgs was actually the Americanised version of one of the Metal Hero franchise actually.
<DSNesmith> I had one of the action figures
<Elky> mcdonalds?
<DSNesmith> because I was young and didnt' know the difference
<NewDCD> 9the creator of BOTH series, Super Sentai and Kamen Rider forbid Saban from EVER touching Kamen Rider again
<mib_b73i9l> GONASPONSA CHRISMAS
<Manlyguy> lol
<DSNesmith> beetle borgs, that was it
<HaveTumorWillTravel> KAUNTO ZA MEDARURZU
<Razyn> DSNesmith: BeetleBorgs...?
<Kaezone> damn
<mib_b73i9l> $3.5O DAMN!!
<Darf14> Wait, this was Bettle Borgs?! Wow I didn't know that
*Ray is frustrated
<Kaezone> look at that
<BubblyDoo> This is BB?
<Purple`Prose> Also, Ankh likes popsicles
<DSNesmith> so wait is this the bad guy?
<Kaezone> eating three ice creams at all SAME time
*Zoroark noms Ray.
<Purple`Prose> He's one of the bad guy race
<Dee_Twenty> No no, Beetle Borgs was Metal Hero, not Kamen Rider, similar and same creator but two different franchises.
<Elky> fabulous
<DSNesmith> I can tell how cold and refreshing these are
<DSNesmith> WTF
<Elky> wait, he's a bad guy?
<Ray> 02Not in the mood, sorry
<roll> pfffffffffft
<interior_gummy> three pops, one mouth
<Kaezone> LOL
<Dman> NewDCD where does This show fit into the 18 power rangers series?
<DSNesmith> how impolite
<Purple`Prose> This is a different series
<Darf14> oh, I guess I got confused
<DSNesmith> he's eating WITH HIS FINGERS
<DSNesmith> /rimshot
<trunsako> LOLWUT
<HaveTumorWillTravel> PHALLIC SYMBOLS
<Purple`Prose> unrelated to Power Rangers
<NewDCD> 9Dman, it's Kamen Rider, its sister series
<NewDCD> 9they just share the same creator
<DSNesmith> wait made out of medals
<DSNesmith> lolwut
<Bjornfot> Ice cream food is best food
<Dman> I see
<roll> so
<roll> these dudes drop loot
<roll> when you kill them
<DSNesmith> it's like a popsicle
<roll> right?
<Darf14> So, did this show ever translated to America at all?
<HaveTumorWillTravel> Damn, they say medals more often than Battlefield Earth says leverage.
<DSNesmith> the yummy
<DSNesmith> the bad guys are called yummies
<trunsako> Cores
<YusukeKomiya> that explaaaaaains everything
<DSNesmith> Oh, Japan
<Kaezone> I want an ice cream for some reason
<NewDCD> 9Yummies and Greeeds
<Dman> so power rangers and SUPER SERNTAI are two separate shows, just similar?
<NewDCD> 9because they DEVOUR SHIT
<Elky> really now?
<NewDCD> 9no no
<Dman> or are they interlinked?
<Purple`Prose> similar
<NewDCD> 9Kamen Rider and Super Sentai: different
<DSNesmith> hey look it's snips and snails in japanese form
<NewDCD> 9Super Sentai is Japanese Power Rangers
<Darf14> Armor Car? Do they mean a tank?
<NewDCD> 9or Rather
<Kaezone> Shit
<YusukeKomiya> man there r times when i rmember growin up in japan was pretty weird
<DSNesmith> WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT
<Dman> But i don't see seasons thar are the same >_< so
<NewDCD> 9Power Rangers is American Super Sentai
<NewDCD> 9because SS came first
<trunsako> WTF
<DSNesmith> it just crawled out of his back
<DSNesmith> what the fuck
<Purple`Prose> That's a Yummy
<Bjornfot> >SS
<HaveTumorWillTravel> OOZU
<Purple`Prose> Monster of the Week
<DSNesmith> okay power rangers is silly, this is freaky
<NewDCD> 9Dman: footage from Super Sentai is adapted to Power Rangers
<DSNesmith> without the stick, the ice cream won't hold together
<Elky> kamen rider doesn't have this five man band structure, does it?
<SilverSonic> ;o
<Dman> does anything that happens in SS happen / do anything in PowerRaingers and vice versa? so are they in the same universe, or they are separate universes but based off each other?
<DSNesmith> I'm using that line
<DSNesmith> somehow
<NewDCD> 9Kamen Rider is MUCH, MUCH MORE SERIOUS
<Razyn> Ever since I learned that I wanted to watch Super Sentai
<HaveTumorWillTravel> Yeah, because the masks completely cover their faces, they just dub the American voice actors over the footage, and bingo: 30-minute toy commercial
<NewDCD> 9spoilers: I'm named after Kamen Rider DCD/Decade
<Dee_Twenty> Basic rule of thumb, if the heroes are in spandex it's Super Sentai/Power Rangers, if the hero looks like a bug it's Kamen Rider, and if it looks like a robot it's Metal Hero.
<DSNesmith> >implying the original wasn't a toy commercial
<BubblyDoo> So is the arm the good guy?
<Dman> >98 Kamer Rider episodes
<Dman> WOW
<Purple`Prose> He's...an anti-hero
<Elky> I have no idea
<DSNesmith> raep face
<BubblyDoo> kk
<Kaezone> oh......shit
<Elky> what type?
<Purple`Prose> He's one of the Greeed
<HaveTumorWillTravel> Oh of course it was/is, DSN
<Purple`Prose> Meaning he's one of the bad guys, but has his own agenda
<HaveTumorWillTravel> I meant a *new* toy commercial
<Aponymous> What is with these shows and people in awesome coats?
<Kaezone> OMG
<NewDCD> 9That girl's poni version is FREAKING AMAZING
<trunsako> Uh, shit
<NewDCD> 9DAT MOUSTACHE
<Dman> So NewDCD, what does Decade do?
<Dee_Twenty> There are other tokusatsu as well of course, but Kamen Rider, Super Sentai, and Metal Hero are the three big ones.
<Darf14> She must have Popeye's Genes
<HaveTumorWillTravel> What's with this show and awesome brass music?
<NewDCD> 9http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/300f480ea9391ec3ea0d9ed5127ddc5b/24988%20-%20Kamen_Rider_OOO%20artist%3AEgophiliac%20kamen_rider%20ponified.jpg
<NewDCD> 9JUST LOOK AT HER PONI FORM
<Zoroark> Mmk.
<BubblyDoo> I just did a little.
<Zoroark> What's wrong?
<NewDCD> 9Dman: basically Gokaiger two years before Gokaiger, with cards instead of figurines
<DSNesmith> is she the one in the fabulous hat?
<HaveTumorWillTravel> HER MOOSTASH
<Glacymr> 12o-o

<Glacymr> 12how many gold things do you have from OoT
<Elky> so does kamen rider have this color scheme thing?
<DSNesmith> wtf
<DSNesmith> these things feed
<DSNesmith> so strangely
<Purple`Prose> yeah
<NewDCD> 9Spoilers: The Yummy feed from whatever their "contractor" desires
<mib_7tddvw> O.o
<Aponymous> Eating money with his chest?
<trunsako> ?
<Purple`Prose> Yup
<Darf14> He must be taking a money diet
<DSNesmith> lol @ scream
<NewDCD> 9since this guy was made out of a guy who wanted MONEY, he eats money
<NewDCD> 9and so forth
<NewDCD> 9if you were used to make a Yummy
<Dman> Last question before watching some of these: are all the power rangers seasons, like time / wild force ,ninjastorm/samurai etc etc, the same in the japanese versions?
<DSNesmith> it would eat ponies?
<Darf14> I am here to eat the bank!
<DSNesmith> D:
<NewDCD> 9he'd probably feed out of pony merchandise or something
<Light_Latias> 12umm...
<trunsako> Oh I see.
<DSNesmith> that's horrible
<RainBroDash> 10XD
<HaveTumorWillTravel> Best example ever, DCD :D
<prince-dari> So if I desire wiminz, what do I eat?
<DSNesmith> don't worry, guys, you're safe with me
<Light_Latias> 12in my original file on N64 I have 100
<Glacymr> 12i bet you have all 100
<Dee_Twenty> Dman: No, not at all. They use the footage, but write their own stories.
<Aponymous> WE MUST STOP IT FROM EATING THE PONIES!
<Light_Latias> 12in 3D
<DSNesmith> hush, fluttershy, I won't let anyone eat you
<NewDCD> 9Dman: somewhat. Wild Force = Gaoranger, Ninja Storm= Hurricanger
<Darf14> I will take this Yen AND EAT IT!!!
<HaveTumorWillTravel> Once you were healed, you'd get slapped with over 9000 rape convictions, Dari
<Light_Latias> 12I have around 50 and around 30
<NewDCD> 9Dari: DON'T GO THERE BRO
<Dman> Dee_Twenty ok i'll just have to watch ALL OF THEM

<NightSeas> 12Hey Umbreon :34
<DSNesmith> that's the general hierarchy
<Dee_Twenty> Car Ranger for example was meant to be more of a parody, Turbo however the plot was (intended) to be serious, and because of this it's well known as the season that nearly killed Power Rangers.
<NewDCD> 9OOOs
<mib_myxa8p> lol wtf
<NightSeas> 12-4
<SirSprinkles> 6This guy is a level of crazy that is just awesome.
<DSNesmith> also, why is he pouring icing

<HaveTumorWillTravel> I LOVE THIS GUY. He's a bigger ham than John Travolta and Nic C... well, a bigger ham than John Travolta.
<Dman> OOO
<DSNesmith> he can't be bigger than John Malkovich
<DSNesmith> or Stallone
<NewDCD> 9yes
<DSNesmith> or the bad guy from Judge Dredd
<NewDCD> 9I know
<Purple`Prose> BIG CAKE IS BIG!
<DSNesmith> LAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAW
<NewDCD> 9Cakeboss is AMAZING
<Dee_Twenty> Is Cakeboss his actual name?
<Dman> Kamina is a pretty good ham
<Dman> big ham
<DSNesmith> wow, they really want that blond guy to be bishie don't they
<BubblyDoo> yes
<NewDCD> 9nah, it's his fan nickname
<DSNesmith> also, disappearing arm is lols
<Darf14> He likes cake, so evil people make's cakes, so from this I have learned that Cakes are made by Evil People and if that's true then Cakes = Evil
<Elky> definitely
<Dman> CAKEBAWS
<DSNesmith> wow this shit's pretty serious for a weird japanese fighting show
<Purple`Prose> Eiji is frikken badass, btw
<Dee_Twenty> I was going to say, between that and Yummies it's hard to believe this is supposed to be more serious than Super Sentai. XD
<Chimera> 04gold skulltula oh god
<mib_b73i9l> THE CAKE IS A LIE!
<HaveTumorWillTravel> KEEIKII BOSSU
<Chimera> 04those things are hell to find x-x
<Bjornfot> did they died
<Elky> where's that weird cake monster coming from though?
<Dman> KEEKII
<Glacymr> 12i agreee
<Elky> scratch the cake, I wanted to write bug
<DSNesmith> so if you made a yummy out of a pony
<BubblyDoo> SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSPPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACCCCCCCEEEEEEEE!!!
<DSNesmith> what would it be
<Razyn> I loved that expression
<Purple`Prose> It's the yummy that was eating money
<DSNesmith> 0.0
<DSNesmith> holy shit this is dark
<Dman> veryserious for what it was
<Purple`Prose> YEah.
<Purple`Prose> EIJI is badass
<DSNesmith> 0.o children getting shot in the face
<DSNesmith> okaaaay
<NewDCD> 9Kamen Rider is some SERIOUS SHIT, CAN YA CATS DIG IT
<DSNesmith> silly feeling's gone
<Dee_Twenty> Well if it was made of Rainbow Dash it would probably eat the Wonderbolts.
<Darf14> This is pretty dark, you know for Kids!
<Purple`Prose> Happy hobo is not so happy
<DSNesmith> fluttershy would eat the animals
<trunsako> More Grimdark than one would think O.o
<NewDCD> 9Kamen Rider would make a great primetime show
<NewDCD> 9also
<Glacymr> 12i'm determined to at least get 30 though
<DSNesmith> applejack... would eat granny smith's hip
<NewDCD> 9SPOILERS: this is nowhere near as dark as Kuuga
<Elky> xD
<DSNesmith> dear god pinkie
<NewDCD> 9or Kamen Rider BLACK
<DSNesmith> what would pinkie eat
<Elky> pinkie would eat... sweets?
<NewDCD> 9this is actually pretty light for standard Rider fare
<Dee_Twenty> Pinkie would eat Dash of course.
<HaveTumorWillTravel> Hmmm... Twilight would eat books and possibly friends, Rarity would obsessively cut up all the clothes in sight, and Pinkie would devour sweets and throw parties. So no change in Pinkie's case then.
<Purple`Prose> Eiji ran up there, un-henshined, and is going to save people
<Darf14> Pinkie will eat anything
<DSNesmith> pinkie's yummy would feed on fun
<DSNesmith> pure fun
<NightSeas> 12I have over 9000 of them
*NightSeas runs
<rubenflonne> im heading out now, take care everypony wish i can stay for the rest of this x.x
<Glacymr> 12lol
<Dman> NewDCD what's the difference between black and black rx?
<Glacymr> 12that was tasty
<Razyn> I can't picture Americans really supporting this. Dunno why
<NewDCD> 9Dman: Black RX is the sequel, as in think Black leveled up
<Glacymr> 12why didn't i put pepper on my mac and cheese before
<Dman> oh ok. is that also dark?
<DSNesmith> dat physics
<NewDCD> 9Black RX is really lighthearted too
<Dman> oh
<NightSeas> 12XD
<DSNesmith> wait so the arm left the other guy to die
<NewDCD> 9and Black RX was used for Saban's Masked Rider
<Purple`Prose> HENSHIN!
<Dman> TaToBa
<HaveTumorWillTravel> Oh, this bit. They always transform just before they hit the ground.
<Purple`Prose> TATOBATATOBA!
<DSNesmith> this kid's nose is strange
<Dee_Twenty> There was actually an American adaptation of a Kamen Rider on Fox a while back, can't remember what it was though. I remember something about using mirrors to henshin.
<Purple`Prose> And now, the awesome sword
<DSNesmith> it's too low or something on his face
<NewDCD> 9DAT SWORD
<BubblyDoo> TaToBa=DyNoMite
<DSNesmith> lol dat hand
<Dman> SUGOI
<DSNesmith> do vending machines actually look like this in japan?
<Darf14> Wow, a sword
<NightSeas> 12Really though, I have around 25 on the 3D one
<Dee_Twenty> DCD is the big Kamen Rider fan, he'd probably know which one I'm talking about.
<Glacymr> 12:<
<Glacymr> 12i see
<Glacymr> 12and blah NightSeas
<Elky> well, do coins look like that in Japan?
<Glacymr> 12i wanna build an unlimited lostgar
<HaveTumorWillTravel> Pretty much, DSN, but they usually have panties inside.
<Dman> NICE TRANSformation wow
<mib_19uud2> Epic
<NewDCD> 9I mentioned it
<Chimera> 0430 gets you waht
<Chimera> 04*what
<NewDCD> 9oh
<Chimera> 04the Giant's Wallet?
<DSNesmith> I want that vending machine
<NewDCD> 9you mean Kamen Rider Dragon Knight
<NewDCD> 9it's based in Ryuki
<Dee_Twenty> Yeah, that's the one.
<DSNesmith> AND IT COMES WITH COKE DISPENSARY
<Purple`Prose> And now, more merchendise
<NightSeas> 12Xd
<DSNesmith> awesome
<Darf14> He must use a vending machine to get a power, I have to admit that is origional
<Chimera> 04or is that 40?
<Dman> wat. NewDCD have you seen every thing to do with powerrangers?
<DSNesmith> oh wait they aren't actually drinks
<NightSeas> 12XD*
<trunsako> FUCK. YES
<DSNesmith> drat
<Purple`Prose> ROBOCANS
<nyeh> OCTOPUS
<mib_7tddvw> oh thats cool
<DSNesmith> I was hoping for a drink machine
<trunsako> Oh wait...
<EmmettBrown> OCTOPI
<NewDCD> 9Dman: Power Ranger/Super Sentai ain't my thing
<NewDCD> 9I'm into Kamen Rider
<Purple`Prose> ROBOCAN ROAD
<mib_myxa8p> so the officer is just dying right now?
<Razyn> Fuck I'm thirsty now
<HaveTumorWillTravel> Seriously, Darf? That's a pretty inconvieniently specific power source
<NewDCD> 9Gokaiger is an exception because it's AMAZING
<Glacymr> 12i wanna get the giant's wallet
<DSNesmith> physics
<Dman> ok but we're watching it now. so gokaiger is waaaay better than the other shows?
<DSNesmith> how do they work
<Darf14> Octopus? Can't be a Japanese show without a Octopus
<Dman> the other SS shows?
<Glacymr> 12and yes 30
<Darf14> A giant bug! Its Star Ship Troopers all over again.
*NightSeas gives Glacymr a giant wallet
<NewDCD> 9not really, it just isn't my fandom
<DSNesmith> this thing is like a finger horror
<Glacymr> 12yay
<DSNesmith> anyone read Goblins?
<Purple`Prose> I don't think Eiji thought this out
<NewDCD> 9I like some Super Sentai..the older ones actually
*Glacymr puts all of NightSeas's money in it and walks off
<NewDCD> 9like Liveman and Jetman
<NewDCD> 9SUDDENLY SKA
<NightSeas> 12D:
<HaveTumorWillTravel> I'm inclined to agree, DCD. I only watched Power Rangers in passing as a kid, and on top of that I normally need to watch all the episodes so far before getting into a series. Gokaiger grabbed me right away, though.
<DSNesmith> dat ska
<DSNesmith> lol pwned
<Purple`Prose> Skaaaaa!
<Purple`Prose> OW
<Keiw> I like how this kamen rider is the only one that gets its own song when transforming
<Darf14> PWN
<Purple`Prose> BUUUUUUUUNGI!
<Glacymr> 12thx
<HaveTumorWillTravel> This show ain't bad either, it at least has some sweet music
<Bjornfot> tatoba
<Darf14> man, he is a rookie
<Hallfrost00> Which movie is this?
<DSNesmith> so the plot is... go kill the fuck out of giant spider things and collect the coins
<NewDCD> 9series, Kamen Rider OOO
<DSNesmith> and the merchandise is even easier to make
<HaveTumorWillTravel> What number episode is this?
<Ziltoid> I love how dumb this show is

<NewDCD> 9 02

<HaveTumorWillTravel> Anything Goes!
<NewDCD> 9as in
<DSNesmith> love notes through text
<Spray> Roara mistyped my name around noon
<mib_myxa8p> so what about the dying officer
<mib_y3xdmu> Was he eating a banana?
<Glacymr> 12spray is sparks
<NewDCD> 9he basically BENDS REALITY with his slash
<trunsako> One hell of a Can Opener
<Darf14> Way to go hero, you just cut a building in half and killing anyone that got in the blades path
<DSNesmith> those are nice phones though
<Elky> really purple?
<Spray> glacy
<Dman> so. NewDCD. which show/s would you recommend?
<Elky> huh
*Spray throws ice
<NewDCD> 9so then the distortion is concentrated on the enemy
<Purple`Prose> That's what it's called >.>

<Dee_Twenty> The "fat" guy.
<Kaezone> monster or something
<Purple`Prose> The Yummy is the monster of the week
<Korrisel> Silly asains.
<Darf14> Lookout! Its the Blob!
<jpony> what is this horrible awesomeness
<Kaezone> Get in my BELLY
<Purple`Prose> Right now, it's a parasite inside the fat guy that's making him eat obsessively
<EmmettBrown> ha he thinks it food]#
<NewDCD> 9SUP OCTOPUS
<Dee_Twenty> So basically it's made him an American. HEYO!
<Darf14> ITS A TRAP!
<Keiw> super effective!

<Keiw> fatman's rage!

<Kaezone> He hungers for MOAR
<EmmettBrown> Suddenly the burp of all burps destroys the building
<CircuitMane> never deny me my pizza!
<prince-dari> FLASHBACK
<Maxaminus> Obligatory lens flare
<prince-dari> ASDFGAFDGDFOBIK
<Darf14> That flashback is getting old
<Kaezone> Lol
<Maxaminus> Hey wait..
<Keiw> what?
<Dman> 0MEOW

<Nittany_Tiger> UUUUUUUUUUU
<Keiw> sword has no effect!
<Maxaminus> *boing*
<Purple`Prose> He's so fat, the attacks bounce off
<Kaezone> His fatness is deflecting the hits
<Elky> the music is one of the weaker points of this...
<Razyn> Stab, moron
<Darf14> Some one call Chip and Dale, they will take care of Fat Cat easily
<Maxaminus> boing boing
<Duskfly> thats exactly what the sword is
<Duskfly> plastic
<Dee_Twenty> Try a gun based configuration numbnuts!
<Kaezone> Just shoot him
<Purple`Prose> He doesn't have a gun
<Korrisel> Coins?
<Nittany_Tiger> Hey, it spews money.
<Maxaminus> Suddenly he's a slot machine.
<Kaezone> or kick lol
<Darf14> He punched the money out of him
<Purple`Prose> Blades don't work, but impacts do
<CircuitMane> hmm, tai-bo does work!
<Purple`Prose> S-S-S-SCANNING CHARGE!
<NewDCD> 9RIDER KIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICK
<Darf14> It makes sense, if you defeat a enemy they drop money
<Maxaminus> Longfall boots?
<Ziltoid> what
<prince-dari> The hell happened to his legs? O_o
<Dee_Twenty> Surely some combination of those three coins has to give him a gun.
<Darf14> FALCON KICK
<NewDCD> 9they became those of a Grasshopper for the Scanning Charge
<Razyn> It's like an attack out of Disgaea
<Dashite> Magic happened.
<Kaezone> He's bleeding medals
<Maxaminus> Is the fat kid dead?
<Elky> I don't think so
<Kaezone> I hope he does
<prince-dari> Noooooooooooooooooooooo

<FluttershysATree> Lol
<Dashite> One of these days you guys need to stream spider's web as soon as the normal show is over and before everyone leaves.
<Bane> Did anyone go to comic con?
<Ziltoid> dammit
<Bjornfot> umad
<Elky> dashite: already happened last week
<Ziltoid> you finnally did it
<FluttershysATree> Also thanks
<Dee_Twenty> Nope, they don't hold cons anywhere near Bumfuck Nowhere. :(
<Elky> at least I think so, I wasn't there
<SirSprinkles> 6Dashite: No. It already happened and it's against our rules for any movie anyway.
<Korrisel> So does it end?
<Dashite> Aw
<NewDCD> 9Dashite: it's been done
<NewDCD> 9or so I hear
<Nittany_Tiger> Who's the one that wanted my Saw autographed stuff?
<Dave_BroZilla> ▼ ▼
<Dave_BroZilla> ▼
<Dashite> I must have missed it.
<Korrisel> DAVE
<Ziltoid> I was there
<Korrisel> IS
<Korrisel> A
<Korrisel> NEWFAG
<Darf14> Its the Anti Triforce!
<Dave_BroZilla> Sup my bronies
<Korrisel> just kidding.
<Nittany_Tiger> Someone was interested in it last Saturday.
<Aponymous> Someone streamed Spiders Web again? wut
<Nittany_Tiger> Because I'm putting it up for sale.
<Dee_Twenty> Saw has fans? o_o
<Dave_BroZilla> It's all good Korrisel
<Nittany_Tiger> Yes.
<Purple`Prose> night all
<Dman> 0lol
<mib_b73i9l> Friendshiiip
<Dave_BroZilla> Aww
<prince-dari> Yeah, I restreamed Spider's Web Aponymous. :P
<Elky> so who'll stream tomorrow?
<prince-dari> Sprinkles.
<Dave_BroZilla> Purple`Prose
<Darf14> Of couse Saw has fans, heck I even saw saw
<Dave_BroZilla> oH, he gone
<Nittany_Tiger> I've seen them all.
<NewDCD> 9oh yeah
<NewDCD> 9Dman
<NewDCD> 9you still around?
<Aponymous> I can't be here tomorrow, I've got a party to go to.
<NewDCD> 9still want those descriptions?
<Nittany_Tiger> The series ended poorly.
<Darf14> I agree
<Elky> I haven't seen any Saw movie
<Dee_Twenty> >Implying they won't make a dozen more Saw movies, excluding the inevitable reboot.
<Dave_BroZilla> I saw saw four for saw five
<Nittany_Tiger> But John Kramer remains one of the best villains of all time.
<Darf14> only watch the first two
<Aponymous> I saw the first Saw movie, found it rather boring. Was shocked to find out that was Cary Elwes though.
<Elky> they're more body horror, right?
<Razyn> DCD, I'd like those descriptions.
<Dee_Twenty> They're gore purely for the sake of gore.
<prince-dari> Saw is pretty much just gore.
<Dave_BroZilla> Any exploited memes from Jaws or Black DynamiteÉ
<NewDCD> 9okay
<NewDCD> 9*le cough*
<Nittany_Tiger> The first ones were more psycological. As they made more movies, they brought it more gore.
<Darf14> Its also about traps
<Elky> hm, I guess I can ignore them then
<Ziltoid> you dig?
<bloomberg> oh hai
<Elky> traps?
<NewDCD> 9http://i.imgur.com/hGW1R.png
<NewDCD> 9okay
<Nittany_Tiger> There wasn't much gore in Saw 1.
<Darf14> The second one has traps
<Nittany_Tiger> And a bit more in 2.
<EmmettBrown> Woudn't mind Johnny English or BTTF
<Elky> ho tree
<Elky> johnny english? ugh
<bloomberg> oh.....this thread again
<Nittany_Tiger> Gore overkill didn't happen until about 4 or 5.
<NewDCD> 9if you like a good atmosphere and immersion on a show, as well as good plot and character development, try Kuuga
<Dave_BroZilla> Thanks much NewDCD
<Razyn> Mhm.
<Dman> 0ACK yea i' here sorry NewDCD
<Dman> 0Ok reading
<prince-dari> Elky: You don't like Johnny English?
<Elky> not really
<Nittany_Tiger> Anyway, I need to sell my autographed Saw merchandise so I can make rent for this month.
<prince-dari> :o
<Dman> 0Sorry i was doing some work...on Chemistry B)
<EmmettBrown> thou blasphem :p
<Dman> 0I wanna be a medstudent too ya know : D
<Elky> isn't there a second movie out now?
<NewDCD> 9the same could be said for Agito, which is a very loose, direct continuation of Kuuga. It can be watched without watching Kuuga first. But if you'd like to see three riders in action in an all-around great piece, give this a try. Currently, my favorite modern Rider series
<Elky> I have no idea
<Nittany_Tiger> Second what?
<prince-dari> I saw a trailer for a second movie.
<prince-dari> So yeah.
<EmmettBrown> Its not out yet
<Elky> second johnny english movie, at least I saw posters
<Dman> 0ok, I really like epic battles and i do enjooy dark stories. These two sound good, but the others?
<Dman> 0: P
<NewDCD> 9Ryuki, if you don't dislike cards, and you love plots like in the Higurashi/Umineko series and BlazBlue. As in, you have to piece the plot together like a mystery, and it's great thinking material. Also, 13 Riders duking it out in the Rider War.
<Darf14> Wait, there's a second Johnny English movie, didn't know that
<Dave_BroZilla> What about the second Sherlock Holmes movie coming out?
<Dee_Twenty> From what we've seen Kuuga streamed here Kuuga has a habit of going most of each episode before getting to the good part, read the part where he henshins up and kicks ass, so keep that in mind.
<Glacymr> 12guess i creeped eXAKR ut
<Glacymr> 12out
<Elky> the sherlock holmes movie was good if you didn't think too hard about it being sherlock holmes...
<RedDragonX> Man everyone seems so withdrawn now lol
<NewDCD> 9Faiz if you like GRIMDARK but not excessively, and misunderstandings. Oh, and fancy gear, Faiz could be said to be Kamen Rider James Bond in some ways.
<Nittany_Tiger> What should I sell my Saw stuff on? Craigslist. I don't trust getting 100%+ for what I paid for it on eBay.
<Elky> but do we need a sequel?
<NewDCD> 9Kuuga is basically PLOT, PLOT EVERYWHERE
<Dave_BroZilla> That Irish jig in the fight was catchy as all hell, though
<Dave_BroZilla> Rocky Road To Dublin by The Dubliners
<prince-dari> The Sherlock Holmes series that was on a while ago was good.
<Razyn> I like story plot.
<NewDCD> 9kay, Blade is DARKER than Faiz, and uses cards. Watch this if you don't mind a depressing ending to a great story.
<Nittany_Tiger> Even if I start the bidding at 80%
<Dave_BroZilla> best 99 cents spent on iTunes in age
<Dave_BroZilla> ages*
<prince-dari> It was only something like 4 episodes though.
<EmmettBrown> Crap I think my heart started beating to this tune
<Dman> 0depressing ending? : / I DO liek cards thou : P
<Aponymous> Mine too...
<Dave_BroZilla> lol Doc Brown
<Elky> there was a tv series?
<NewDCD> 9Hibiki, if you like HIT THE BEAT KEEP YOUR BEAT. Or, in other words, musical-based Riders, as Hibiki mentors the young boy Asumu, in a coming-of-age story.
<Elky> the uk gets all the good stuff
<prince-dari> Elky: Yeah, I really liked it.
<prince-dari> Was so disappointed at how short it was.
<Dave_BroZilla> Oh yeah
<NewDCD> 9Kabuto if you like powered armor and HOLY SHIT THEY'RE MOVING SO FAST IT'S LIKE TIME HAS STOPPED OH GOD CLOCK UP IS THE BEST SHIT EVER
<prince-dari> I think it might be coming back some time.
<Dave_BroZilla> The Sherlock series my parents got me on Blu-Ray
<Razyn> Musical riders...
<Dave_BroZilla> they're doing the second season in October
<Darf14> yay, the song is over
<Kaezone> PEACE
<EmmettBrown> The professor Layton movie is only in the UK
<Dave_BroZilla> and also doing an interpretation of Hound Of The Baskervilles
<bloomberg> whats up with this? are we between movies?
<bloomberg> more like lord english
<bloomberg> berb
<Bjornfot> awwww
<Elky> bye stream
<Polarfire> nooooo!!!!
<Dave_BroZilla> Word to big bird Kaezone
<prince-dari> There's a professor Layton film?
<EmmettBrown> yep
<prince-dari> Hmm, I didn't know that.
<EmmettBrown> Professor Layton and the Eternal Diva
<Darf14> Professor Layton film?! WANT!
<Aponymous> Streams done, Night everypony! See ya next week!
<Ziltoid> noooooo
<Elky> night apon
<EmmettBrown> I has on DVD
<Dman> 0NewDCD I wanna see so many of those via your descripsions now >_<
<Darf14> night apon
<NewDCD> 9Den-O, if....well, you like comedy, I guess...albeit sorta lame one at that. The greatest characters in that series aren't introduced till around the middle of the series. Deneb is fucking BOSS. Oh, it's also the cash cow of the franchise, and kids love it because it's "goofy"
<Nittany_Tiger> Cya
<NewDCD> 9Kiva, if you're a tremendous faggot
<NewDCD> 9in other words
<NewDCD> 9avoid Kiva
<NewDCD> 9AVOID KIVA LIKE THE PLAGUE
<EmmettBrown> Mr Beans holiday is pretty good too
<NewDCD> 9it's the black sheep of the franchise, and with good reason
<prince-dari> Should stream Mr Bean episodes for the lulz.
<Dee_Twenty> You realise of course that means I HAVE to watch Kiva now.
<Razyn> Tell us what's what, DCD
<NewDCD> 9Kiva is....KAMEN RIDER EDWARD CULLEN
<NewDCD> 9okay no
<Ziltoid> I have mr beans holiday on godamn tape
<NewDCD> 9it's basically...Vampires. Or "Fangire"
<NewDCD> 9but yeah
<EmmettBrown> I din't think they have full episodes on youtube
<NewDCD> 9it's not something you want to watch.
<EmmettBrown> just clips
<Dman> 0why does it suck?
<prince-dari> They have full episodes of everything on the internet. :P
<NewDCD> 9seriously, don't harm yourself like that
<Dman> 0vampires CAN be cool, even if Twilight is SHIT
<Razyn> Whoa, that's some heavy stuff there.
<Dee_Twenty> There's a ponified version of the Fangires you know?
<Elky> vampires are cool
<Dman> 0I'm a big fan of animes, see, and there's one called 'Vampire Knight'
<EmmettBrown> That scene where he is on top of his car is awesome hough
<NewDCD> 9yes, but Kiva is kind of....well, it's not the COOL vampires.
<Dman> 0it's good
<Darf14> No, Fez's are cool
<Dman> 0um...ok then : P
<Elky> I need to choose Bram Stoker's Dracula just to prove it
<NewDCD> 9when I say Kamen Rider Edward Cullen, I mean it as in "the MC is just as bland"
<prince-dari> Should stream some Doctor Who episodes then.
<NewDCD> 9in other words, it's very unlikeable
<Dman> 0uh ok : P
<NewDCD> 9the general consensus is that Kiva is boring as all fuck
<NewDCD> 9so avoid it
<prince-dari> Coz Doctor Who is the shit. You dig?
<Dman> 0BTWi got all ur descripions in Notepad : D
<Elky> I wanted to watch Doctor Who forever, but where do you start with a series like that?
<Ziltoid> what doctor who episodes?
<Darf14> Agree
<Dee_Twenty> http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/198/d/0/commission___my_little_vampony_by_egophiliac-d3xtt99.jpg
<Dave_BroZilla> prince-dari I can diglett
<NewDCD> 9Decade/DCD, is pretty much the Modern Kamen Rider Party Platter
<prince-dari> Lawl Dave.
<sklar> 0so the party's over
<prince-dari> Well what would you prefer?
<NewDCD> 9he travels worlds, meeting Alternate versions of teh past Riders I've mentioned
<prince-dari> The newer ones or the older ones?
<NewDCD> 9they are very different from their usual counterparts
<NewDCD> 9it's kind of like a fanfic...and pretty much survives on fan wanking, I guess
<NewDCD> 9it's not a good starting point.
<prince-dari> O_o
<Dman> 0Lol haha
<NewDCD> 9save it for when you get to know other Riders.
<sklar> 0What are you guys talking about
<Dave_BroZilla> Ehh, haven't seen the older ones, only when SPACE in Canada restarted the series from the...ninth Doctor, I think it was?
<Dee_Twenty> Pst, do the Doctor Dances.
<NewDCD> 9think of it as Kamen Rider Smash Bros
<NewDCD> 9anyways
<NewDCD> 9then there's Double/W
<Ziltoid> the reboot?
<NewDCD> 9think of it as Kamen Rider: Hardboiled Detective Edition
<Ziltoid> with christoper ecclestion?
<prince-dari> Dee_Twenty: I'll see if I can find it then.
<NewDCD> 9Good plot, great atmosphere, I AIN'T GONNA LET ANYBODY IN MY CITY CRY.
<NewDCD> 9and two people combine to form a single Rider
<Dave_BroZilla> Legendary
<Elky> combine? I'm sold.
<NewDCD> 9but yeah, Kamen Rider Detective Story
<Dee_Twenty> Eccleston is my One True Doctor. <3
<Darf14> What is the Doctor Dances about Dee?
<Dman> 0sweet
<NewDCD> 9then there's OOO, which is basically one of the most well-rounded shows I guess
<sklar> 0NewDCD what the hell are you talking about
<Dave_BroZilla> I need to rewatch it myself, cause I think I missed a couple episodes that were key to the plot, lol
<NewDCD> 9also the combination is not as in GATTAI DA
<prince-dari> David Tennant is my favourite Doctor. :P
<NewDCD> 9it's kind of....one faints, and the other's body is used
<Dashite> That's cause Tennant is awesome.
<NewDCD> 9sklar: they asked me for a guide as to what Kamen Rider series to watch
<NewDCD> 9NOW
<NewDCD> 9as to where to get these series
<Darf14> All hail David Tennant the 10th doctor
<Ziltoid> David tennant is best doctor
<Dman> 0...and youv'e seen all these! wow!
<NewDCD> 9Kuuga can be gotten in Midnight-Crew Subs
<Dee_Twenty> Eh, kind of hard to really explain without giving away too much, but basically the Doctor, Jack, and Rose versus zombies with gasmasks in World War 2 Britain.
<Darf14> Matt Smith is also good
<sklar> 0What the hell is a karmen rider
<Dave_BroZilla> Blew my mind when I was watching Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, and his name came up in the credits under Barty Crouch jr., lmao
<Dman> 0oh NewDCD i'm good with google
<Dman> 0i'll be fine
<prince-dari> Believe it or not, I actually really don't like Matt Smith, contrary to most other people.
<Dman> 0i found the stuff you aired and downloaded it
<NewDCD> 9Agito is subbed by Cruel Angel...so to get Agito subs, you're going to have to work harder and find some working MUs
<NewDCD> 9also
<Dman> 0episode 8 we saw then 9 right?
<Ziltoid> expept they are not gasmasks
<NewDCD> 9I haven't watched ALL ALL
<Dashite> Dammit Dari, are you me?
<Elky> sklar: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KamenRider
<Dman> 0lol k
<NewDCD> 9but I know my shit about each
<Ziltoid> spoilders
<Dman> 0haha sounds it yup yup
<NewDCD> 9also I haven't even mentioned the CLASSIC series
<prince-dari> Dashite: Maybe I am. ;)
<Dave_BroZilla> Freaked me out so badly, I fear that if I watch the new episodes with Tennant there'll be a plot to raise Voldemort from the dead each time
<NewDCD> 9from the 70s till the 80s
<Dman> 0yea got all ur descripsions in notepad
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<sklar> 0Elky Bug people?
<HyperMetalLugia> trolols
<Elky> seems like it
<NewDCD> 9the only classic series subbed are Amazon and Stronger and V3 though, and they're subbing Kamen Rider 1 now
<Dman> 0cuz i'm tired and can't think so will do tomorrow. and i'll read ur fanfic and JUDGE !!!!!!
*Glacymr gives HyperMetalLugia a remote
<Elky> it's japan, so it's bound to be strange
<prince-dari> So you want the Doctor Dances then?
<Dashite> If you are me, then what number am I thinking of right now?
<NewDCD> 9oh
<NewDCD> 9however
<Dman> 0prince-dari that's a good episode
<Dave_BroZilla> Sure
<NewDCD> 9if you want a GOOD introduction to the classic series
<NewDCD> 9go read Kamen Rider SPIRITS
<NewDCD> 9just do it
<NewDCD> 9Manga of the Year all Years
<Dee_Twenty> Might want to start with the episode prior to it since it's the second half of a two parter.
<prince-dari> Give me a minute to close my 100s of tabs, otherwise I'll probably lag. :P
<Dman> 0Yea saw that in EQUESTRIDADILY
<sklar> 0Dashite fuck you and your numbers
<Darf14> Is it a old episode? Because I haven't heard of it
<Dman> 0probably will : P
<NewDCD> 9guaranteed to make you break into Manly Tears once every two chapters AT LEAST
<prince-dari> It's a Christopher Eccleston.
<Dman> 0doctor dances is new doctor!
<Dman> 0not old!
<Dashite> THE NUMBERS SKLAR! WHAT DO THEY MEAN?!
<Ziltoid> what happens in doctor dances?
<Dman> 0Nicde NewDCD, challenge accepted
<NewDCD> 9so yes
*HyperMetalLugia presses it?
<NewDCD> 9if you want my advice
<Razyn> Manga of the Year all Years? I dunno 7 billion Needles was pretty cool.
<Darf14> Dang, I cant remember Doctor Dances
*Glacymr poofs into a dolphin x-x
<Glacymr> 12didn't say to press it
<Dave_BroZilla> Ohh, damn
<prince-dari> Spoiler: He dances.
<Dave_BroZilla> I thought you meant tomorrow
<prince-dari> :P
<Dman> 0I like cards, and I like timespeedthingy so those will probs be the first ones
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Niight
<Ziltoid> NO
<NewDCD> 9start with either Kuuga, Ryuki, Kabuto, or OOOs + SPIRITS
<Darf14> It might jog back my memory if I see it
<Dashite> Thanks for ruining it for me Dari!
<Dman> 0ok
<Dee_Twenty> Is that the manga that Madmax did fanart for with Pinkie Pie as the Rider?
<Dave_BroZilla> I'm gonna have to crash right now, I'm still feeling sick

<Dman> 0ah reequests?
<jpony> i was pretty impressed personally
<Elky> Tabitha St. Germain does an awesome job.
<Dman> 0Now, what's a good DR WHO episode to show these virgins of dr who =P
<jpony> i mean obv Tara Strong's the ace
<Ziltoid> um
<jpony> I always figured I'd like Dr Who but I've never really watched it
<Dman> 0jpony it's pretty good
<jpony> its only on bbc uk here and i dun hav that channel on my basic cable
<Elky> Twilight has a good voice, but Rarity's really varied and all-around good.

<jpony> indeed
<prince-dari> Computer, why u so slow, internet, why u so derp on me
<Dee_Twenty> Doctor Who varies in quality from season to season.
<jpony> probably true of all long runners
<Dman> 0prince-dari : /
<Elky> except simpsons, it stays consistently bad
<Dman> 0Where do you reside, prince? UK? Germany?
<prince-dari> UK
<Dee_Twenty> In this case it's due to the fact they change Doctors and companions every couple of seasons.
<jpony> hahaha Elky
*Dman 0brohoofs prince-dari
<Dman> 0I genuinely didn't know this
*prince-dari brohoofs Dman
<jpony> I used to watch the Simpsons until like 10 years ago
<prince-dari> Where are you? I'm England, Berkshire.
<Dee_Twenty> Out of the current series the season with Martha was my least favourite, admittedly that might be due to me being bitter over Rose...
<Darf14> Doctors come and go, it could take to a minimum as one season or to the maximum as the 4th doctor
<prince-dari> Stream might be up, someone check?
<Elky> it's up
<jpony> eeyup
<Dee_Twenty> Dat infinite window.
<Dman> 0Everywhere we go!

<Elky> I guess he'll do about an hour of preshow
<Dman> 0yea i've seen stuff like that weeks ago :P
<jpony> 10 hours whoa
<prince-dari> Usually it's about an hour, he doesn't always do one though.
<jpony> right
<Dman> 0yea twiceit wasn't on D:
<Elky> 10 hours, that could mean a nearly 14 hour stream

<Darf14> maybe your speakers are off?
<Elky> even with max volume
<Dman> 0i think if u move mouse the bars disappear
<Dman> 0should do
<Elky> no, I hear something like static
<jpony> all i hear is this high pitched squeaking noise
<Elky> yup
<Dman> 0prince-dari, theres a glitch with megavideo player. to fix it, hover mouse over video again and move mouse again
<Dman> 0fixes it sometimes
<Dman> 0OR fullscreen : P
<jpony> my headphone cord might be messed up tho
<Dee_Twenty> I hear absolutely nothing.

<jpony> do what you think is best
<Dman> 0:/
<prince-dari> The sound would require more bandwidth than the video. XD
<Dman> 0'Do your best sonic'
<jpony> if someone touches you in a place or in a way that makes you feel uncomfortable
<Nittany_Tiger> go with it.

<Dman> 0are you my mummy?
<prince-dari> MFW 1000s of people ate custard and fish fingers due to Doctor Who for sure
<prince-dari> Dashite: I dunno
<jpony> how does one check something like that
<prince-dari> I haven't set that up.
<Dman> 0ofc me included ;D
<prince-dari> How would I find out if it is set up like that.
<Dman> 0i really REALLY feel thou that 9th doctor is so dumb and 8th and the rest
<Dman> 0compared to 10th and 11th GODLIKE GENIUSES
<Dashite> What version of windows?
<Dman> 0is what i feel
<SilverSonic> lol
<Dashite> I know it's "Control Panel -> Sound -> Communications Tab" in 7
<drf|laptop> 03my name has 3 r's in it

<prince-dari> Tom Baker is the best old Doctor.
<Dman> 0windows 7 masta race
<drf|laptop> 03and who cares, s is just another letter :|
<jpony> i might be able to upgrade but im too lazy
<Dman> 0'>_< don't you dare make me decide on a best doctor prince-dari
<jpony> also afraid of change
<prince-dari> Tennant is best new Doctor and overall Doctor. :P
<jpony> oh shi-
<sotha> What is going on in this ep?
<CallingCthulhu> ...Are you my Mummy?
<Dee_Twenty> Tennant? Silly Dari, that's not how you spell Eccleston.
<CallingCthulhu> BOOM
<Dman> 0yea but prince-dari just cuz he had most of airtime
<jpony> pyros errywhere
<prince-dari> No. It's not, because Tennant is best Doctor. :P
<Dman> 0hahaha : P
<prince-dari> MFW David Tennant hardly had any airtime. T_T
<Chimera> 04:>
<CallingCthulhu> Haha.
<CallingCthulhu> No.
<Chimera> 04slitherin
*Chimera hides
<Dman> 0OH OF COURSE BRILLIANT! *goes and blabbers about SPACE and TIME and stuff noone understands really fast while building an atom computer or sometshiz*
<Chimera> 04</harrypottergeekjoke>
<CallingCthulhu> I'll rather have Christopher Eccelston and his accent anyday :D
<Dman> 0i have no fave, but i just wanna say i think 11th doctor is as good as others
<Dman> 0i really like it
<prince-dari> Eccelston doesn't seem very...Doctory.
<Dman> 0it's ... like the DERPY of the Doctors
<CallingCthulhu> Plus Eccelston did NOT go out like a bitch.
<Dman> 0^ read
<prince-dari> He's pretty rude, and doesn't seem very intellegent. :P
<TTG> Doctor Who?
<prince-dari> And he's FUGLY.
<TTG> Awesome
<Dman> 0at least he went out like a bauws
<CallingCthulhu> Eccelston? Fugly? Get your eyes checked.
<Dman> 0'you were brilliant and you know what? so was I'
<Dman> 0YELLOWPARTICLES
<eXAKR> What Chimera
<prince-dari> You don't think he's fugly?
<prince-dari> WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW
*jpony is a Doctor Who noob and has no opinions
<prince-dari> He is SO fugly.
<CallingCthulhu> At least he didn't say 'I DON WANNA GO BOOM REGENERATION'
<Dman> 0he's EH and much older than he is
<TTG> I saw a parody once
<Dman> 0looks
<Dee_Twenty> As opposed to "BAAAAAAW! I DON'T WANNA GO!"
<Dman> 0looks older than is
<drf|laptop> 03you spelled it wrong
<TTG> "I was brilliant. And you know what? So was I!"
<Dashite> ^What CallingCthulhu said above.
<jpony> although David Tennant seems like a pretty cool guy and also apparently was Barty Crouch Jr
<eXAKR> Where was that from?
<Dman> 0prince-dari he had to be this way, as old doctors were ... old and new doctors are young, he was like the middle, the change
<Dman> 0David tennant's 'i don't want to go ;( ' was amazing
<TTG> Chew the Ood?
<prince-dari> David Tennant's exit was so awesome.
<Dman> 0nomnom
<CallingCthulhu> Are you kidding? He went out like a winp >:(
<prince-dari> He survived all the shit that got thrown at him.
<Dee_Twenty> Being thousands of years old it's probably more correct to say he looks younger than he is.
<TTG> Lots of people felt it killed any sort of grown throughout the special
<Dman> 0^what prince-dari said
<prince-dari> Then right at the end.
<prince-dari> Sacrificed himself to save an old man.
<Dman> 0OH MY GOD FUCKING FUCK THAT
<Chimera> 04oh well I'm tired
<prince-dari> That is some NOBLE SHIT.
<Chimera> 04brb
<TTG> He spent the whole special not wanting to die and then, at the end, he still doesn't want to die
<Dman> 0I LOVE THE MASTER AND THEY FUCKING RUINED HIM
<CallingCthulhu> At the end, he shat himself at the prospect of dying.
<Dee_Twenty> And then he whines like a little bitch.
<TTG> I don't agree, though
<prince-dari> Tennant was eaily best.
<TTG> I think he definitely showed he was ready to go when he saved Wilf
<CallingCthulhu> 'NO NO NO I DON'T WANT TO DIE EVEN THOUGH I CAN REGENERATE SO DEATH ISN'T SUCH A BIG DEAL I STILL DONT WANNA' -Ten
<prince-dari> I can't even compare Eccelston or Smith to him.
<prince-dari> LOL
<prince-dari> He said himself.
<jpony> so is everyone left on here from the UK
<Steven_Magnet> 12 Hello, Mikey and welcome to #bronies. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Steven_Magnet> 12 Hello, Mikey and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<prince-dari> When he regenerates he changes completely.
<Dee_Twenty> Nope.
<prince-dari> He's not the same person.
<Lambda> Hey Mikey
<prince-dari> HE as a person dies.
<Mikey> hi
<prince-dari> And becomes someone else.
<prince-dari> With the same memories.
<TTG> I'm American
<prince-dari> It's not the same.
<prince-dari> :P
<Lambda> How are you?
<Dman> 0HURR DURR RUSSEL T DAVIES LAST FINALE IM GONNA GO OUT WID A BVANG MAKE SOMETHING SUPA SPECIAL
<CallingCthulhu> Yes, and Nine understood that and accepted it.
<jpony> as am I
<prince-dari> It's as though he dies and someone else walks off with his body and memory.
<CallingCthulhu> Ten did NOT.
<Mikey> I dont know
<Mikey> I'm fine I guess
<prince-dari> Nine had no choice.
<Mikey> just editing
<Mikey> you?
<prince-dari> He was already dying.
<Dman> 0>ends up ruining the whole master drums build up with DURR timelords sent it caross tiem
<Lambda> Yeah, fine too
<prince-dari> 10 went to his death willingly.
<jpony> I like Star Trek The Next Generation even though it was before my time
<TTG> I never got the innuendo the first time I watched this
<Lambda> not editing though
<Lambda> :P
<CallingCthulhu> Nine had plenty, just not save Rose.
<prince-dari> He didn't have to.
<Mikey> :P
<Dee_Twenty> Yeah, and where Eccleston regenerated with grace and dignity, even excitement at the prospect, Tennant goes out crying like a bitch.
<CallingCthulhu> Same as Ten did.
<jpony> I watch it at 4 AM on UPN lol
<Lambda> just sitting around doing nothing
<Dman> 0hey prince-dari i liek smith B)
<prince-dari> Save Rose, compared to save Wilf?
<jpony> I need to learn how to sleep normal
<prince-dari> Pfffffffffffffff
<TTG> SHOW ME YA MOVES
<CallingCthulhu> Nine didn't HAVE to save Rose.
<Mikey> sounds like me every day
<TTG> Ten didn't have to save Wilf
<prince-dari> He had to take the time essence out of her.
<Dman> 0ALLONS-Y MOLTO BENE
<Dman> 0: D
<CallingCthulhu> Exactly my point.
<drf|laptop> 03did your shower spray?
<Dman> 0the heart of dat tardiiiiis
<Spray> yeah?
<prince-dari> What would have happened if she died with it in her? Would the Tardis even work?
<Spray> I mean that's kind of what showers do
<prince-dari> Would she screw up the whole universe?
<Dman> 0Hmm : /
<CallingCthulhu> Magic.
<Dman> 0yes
<drf|laptop> 03so then your name was redundant
<eXAKR> Why is Sparky now SSpray
<eXAKR> -S
<Spray> ...
<CallingCthulhu> Basically whatever Davies does? Magic!
<Spray> Roara
<Spray> one-word answer
<Dman> 0hey prince-dari howcomes it ssaid there were more tardises but if this one tardis dies the universe ends?
<eXAKR> oo
<Mikey> any plans for the weekend?
<jpony> its time travel I ain't gottta explain shit
<Dman> 0^
<Spray> :D
<prince-dari> Dman: Ask the story writers. :P
<Lambda> celebrating the fact I don't have to work
<Lambda> that's about it
<Lambda> :P
<Lambda> you?
<Spray> ...
*Spray needs more art
<CallingCthulhu> It's not the writers fault. Pretty much every episode Davies wrote was shite.
<Dee_Twenty> The fact that Tennant CHOSE to face his regeneration just makes his whining about it make even LESS sense. If you didn't want to go then you shouldn't have sacrificed yourself you twit.
<Mikey> I dont know probably the zoo tomorrow and something else on sunday
<Spray> 'kay Pixiv ti- WHOOOOOOOA
<jpony> ._.
<Lambda> Ooh, that sounds fun
<CallingCthulhu> Vashta Narada? Angels? That's Moffat.
<Lambda> I miss going to the zoo
<prince-dari> LOL
<prince-dari> He didn't WANT to die.
<Mikey> yeah.....
<prince-dari> But he also couldn't let someone else die when he could do something.
<Lambda> been a long time since I've seen animals that aren't pets or deer
<prince-dari> Because that's who he is.
<TTG> I stress that the "whining" is overthought
<Mikey> lol
<jpony> heroic sacrafice
<prince-dari> ^
<jpony> sacrifice*
<CallingCthulhu> And he ended up whining about it.
<CallingCthulhu> THIS is whining.
<Dman> 0also 'you will hear 4 knocks and die'
<CallingCthulhu> 'I DONNNNNT WANNA GOOOOOO.'
<TTG> He's alone, he's saved the day, he's said goodbye to everyone
<Dman> 0then donnas grandfather DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUR KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK HEY ITS ME LEMME OUT OF THIS PLACE
<CallingCthulhu> And he still cries.
<jpony> but I thought you WANTED whining
<Dee_Twenty> And he should have faced that with the same sort of dignity a heroic sacrifice deserves, he should have regenerated proudly knowing that he saved someone's life.
<TTG> And here he is, at the end of it all, and he thinks
<Dman> 0man i love the show but i HATED 'next doctor'
<prince-dari> He is walking to his death.
<Dman> 0WTF master eating humans?
<prince-dari> He is entitled to be upster.
<prince-dari> upset*
<Dman> 0MAN SO MUCH RAGE
<CallingCthulhu> Nine wasn't.
<Dman> 0yea 10th went out excellently at least
<CallingCthulhu> He went out with a smile and a witty remark.
<lighty> Moorning
<Dman> 0even if the build up was awful
<TTG> Ten had no one to impress though
<Dman> 0exactly
<Dman> 0what TTG says
<TTG> 9 had a witty remark, but he had someone to hear it
<Dee_Twenty> He has the FANS to impress.
<CallingCthulhu> What was Ten's wit? 'I don't want to go?'?
<Glacymr> 12rawr
<Dman> 0this bit is pretty grim
<Dman> 0look at his face bros
<TTG> Who cares about wit when you're dying
<CallingCthulhu> Nine did :D
<prince-dari> Nine was already dying.
<Dee_Twenty> People with dignity.
<prince-dari> When he came out with his wit.
<Dman> 0nine was with Rose
<Dman> 0to impress her
<prince-dari> Ten's last words were before he even had to die.
<CallingCthulhu> Yes, Nine CHOSE to die.
<TTG> He had someone watching him, someone he had to make sure would not be traumatized by the death
<lighty> *huggles a scalie dragon*
<jpony> what's the point of dying if you can't enjoy it? - Rattrap
<prince-dari> Nine had less choice than ten did.
<Dman> 0not really die, more like regenerate
<eXAKR> !lightumbreon
<eXAKR> !glacymr
<Dee_Twenty> Fuck's sake I've got no dignity to speak of and I'd STILL want my ass kicked if I went down crying like a bitch.
*Glacymr now belongs to eXAKR for 12 minutes and has to fly eXAKR around until then
<TTG> Nine had to make the transition for Rose as easy as possible
<eXAKR> !chimera
<Dman> 0yea ten had all the chocie in the world
<jpony> heh Beast Wars in a doctor who chat
