The AJ/RD See Saw
13Panda: 20, 5 for the center content (4 plus a scratch track), 5 for the UI (logo, clock, music, quote, white fill), 10 for music mixing
Her only regret is that she has bonitis
Twilight looks good in vinyl's visors.
Her spine and Arms seem to be, um fukked up
Meh...
meh
Oh shush Carrot Top :P
stupid lag made me type bad

But yeah guys

Shizuka, why so many for the music?
That was one of the first big influential Rhythm is Magic pieces
O_O
Lets watch the Total War Hattori intro!

Ew. The glasses only look good on Vinyl in my opinion
It always starts like that

AWWW Suwako <3
dat is cute
LAWL Aya, just dodge it. :D
Vordox, well that's why it had 12.3 at the title screen
Shizuka, you know you can put it all on the same track and it would cut your render time by a bit >.>
CrimsonPhoenix: I know
13nope, it's the countdown clock that weighs the most
Oh Luna, what have I stubmled into now?
Hey guys did yall call therainbowvortex is loser?
13a 20 minute, chroma keyed, reversed video
O.o
wow
that train
This is too epic
cuuute
moopy they didnt
DON'T RUIN YUKARI'S TRAIN
13audio is cheap because they only overlap for a second at a time, or less
dafuq
lol Yian Kutku
Shizuka, thats true, but the multiple tracks dont help none, ima look up a quicker way to do it okies? ^^
OH SHUT

Yeah, just hit a sword away by punching the blade

How about something that DOESN'T have to do with Rythem Heaven?
Oh snap, SuperBrony64 is looking at Steam sales
nite MadSurge
nite Polydunami
I think it's time I head for bed as well
13Panda: thing is for 90% of the video, only one audio track is actually playing anything, there's more video mixing than audio
Eddmario: To be honest, your attitude...
*Eats top Ramen Block* Again.. Random foods.
How did you know, Hipster_Rush? :3
Oooh, I hope The Last Remnant wins the next vote :3
13asuka burns through frames pretty quick, it's the more complicated video mixes that slow things down
-.-
Polydunami: oh i thought you said Ponies as in all of us :D
Suddenly this cha
chat*
Wow, New Vegas is only $5 right now on Steam
Hi Mom!
Shizuka, hm... hey... uh... what are you specs? ^^
I'm on tv
Hmm, what's that IRC program?
Hai super powerful being of death and life
?? iT'S $10
All your base are belong to us
Eddmario holy carp!
hey there i am
IM ON TV!
so am i! :D
So about religion...
Looks like mIRC to me
hmm chat on stream.. Hell yeah!
HOLY SHIT
Chatception!
13six core cpu, 8gb ram, radeon hd 5750 1gb
Panda: HEY YOUR ON TV! YOUR FAMOUS!
what?
/me waves at Hipster_Rush
SuperBrony64, is best pony!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
LOL!
:D
LAwl Shizuka's all up bragging :D
i feel so alone...
13rendering maxes out all six cores on and off, is probably why she goes through frames so fast, not to mention not a lot changes
it even says when somone conects
night everypony
xD
Wuut,, GBA version or DS?
suddenly JAPAN!
Oh geeze, it's the original
Awww yeeeaaaaah
For GBA
suddenly NIHON!
GBA verison
GBA version
There's a GBA version!?!??!!?
Eddmario: Of course, and DS
what game is this?
This never came out of Japan
The original version! Starting a new save too?
Released only in Japan
Dat offbeat. XD
thats odd Shizuka, I couldnt imagine maxing out 6 cores! i only have a dual and mine doesnt max all that often.
This so needs a translation patch.
beep blop!
so Shizuka were those animated parts of the intermission still a trouble to ya?
?
and since he's using an emulator, button lag won't be as precise
11,02Ewww...the timing is off >>
OohShiny: Rhythm Tengoku
SuperBrony64, hehe ^^
SuperBrony64: That's what you get with Emus. :P
13railings is the only manually animated slide
now lets see the chart
SuperBrony64: kinda
[Achievement 15 minutes of fame!]been on brony state for 15 minute
13the rest are stills, video, or a few vectors layered on each other, sometimes panning
Who here can read Japanese, just a trivial questchin
I can read some
I'm learning
Pwnies: Google translate
sometimes
I can't at all. -_-
Eddmario never use that for translating
ever
... just as a trivial questchin
Shizuka: That still was an amazing intermission :3
Google translate doesn't understand the concept of grammar
wait... Shizuka the time counts down... no?
13yup
especially with japanese
13but the clock video it uses counted up
I wanna learn Japanese. And German. And maybe Russian
13if i ever do countdowns again i'll be rendering that reversed first, so it's not doing it realtime
Shizuka, so its reversed and chroma keyed... and what SV are you using?
I can't see the entertainment value yet
00,02>not sure how large to make canvas
13?
yeaaa beat it up
00,02>makes 4096 wide
Eddmario, if you want to learn Japanese there are plenty of sites to learn with
00,02> 16:9
Shizuka, sony vegas
13oh 9
:/
You're miles off :3
dat data
:D
Hmm.
13basically i took a black video, stuck the timecode in the corner, put in some masks so only the minutes and seconds showed, and rendered 20 minutes
k, back
Phase4: wat?
U SILLY FILY
I don't understand it
00,02Hipster_Rush, paintchat
13then i reverse it, invert the colors, and chroma key out white
ah
00,02canvas is small, 1200x900 or something
00,02so i make big
00,02: D
:D
I'm out
Oh, are people using paintchat for once?
seeya pol--oh
Shizuka, that may be the reason why it takes you so long, a lot of people i know rolled back to 8 and 7 because 9 was glitchy and resource consuming. wait... have you tried using after effects?
I see.
00,02Very_Silly_Filly, yes and no
13after effects strikes me as overpowered for sticking a bunch of pictures and video together :3
Shizuka is from Nihon or anything?
I've never actually used it, it's always been locked when I go into it
Inb4 SuperBrony64 quits at the Bon Odori stage
what game is this
boink
13plus after effects makes asuka cry... vegas can keep all six cores busy, but after effects is extremely hard when it does its render
Shizuka, thats true, but it could help out with render time and quality. i know you dont need anything THAT intensinve. was just asking ^^
OohShiny: she's from germany methinks
13yup
Shizuka: Vega's rendering is like VRROOOOOM
13besides i had a book to take up the hour :3
Shizuka, oh? what book? if you dont mind me asking ^^
13just scrubbing through now looking for errors (found one, plus a handful i don't think i can fix)
Hey, baby! How's it going?
13halo the flood, the book that narrates the first game
have a craving for Guitar Hero now
What day is today? My computer calender is broken...well it won't display for some reason.
13today is twensday smarch 43rd
Friiiiday friiiday
DANG SMARCH WEATHER
MASF123: 20th july :D
Shizuka, oh my! thats awesome... and uh >.> could I help with fixing those errors? Video editing is kind of a passion of mine >.>
why hello capslocks, didn't notice ya
11,02idonteven
13while vegas happily accepts animated gifs, it doesn't seem to like looping them
BOOOO
If it's before midnight MASF123, then it's Thursday. If it's after, it's FRIDAY FRIDAY, GOTTA GET DOWN ON FRIDAY!
13leaves a teeeeeeeny pause between the loop, which means the buffer circles pause just a blink
Shizuka: Yeah, unfortunately, you have to keep looping then
Eddmario, you shall burn in Hellfire
night night everypony!
13same problem i had on the technical derpiculties video with her eyes
In order to get a seamless finish
g'night Shamroc
o.o
Radish hair!
00,02as soon as cloudflare updates its cache, canvas should be bigger
13derpy walking across the screen was fine, but the eyes stuttered on the gif seam
dat face
yea, trying to be precise with a game with a emulator would sorta be a problem
Shizuka, really? hm... have you tried clipping it and then copy and pasting it?
the hell is this @_@
33!
13i would but it's like less than half a second long, didn't want to end up with so many clips
do you know this game?
13referencing them to each other would probably be easier but oh well
bob it's the Rhythm heaven game that wasn't localized
Peel dat onion.
13just like the awards show, i do not intend to look at vegas again for a long time :3
Shizuka, you could always batch edit them, you know.
dat egptian music
wieeeerrrrd ._.
13YES the toot video finally synced
Reminds me of Warioware.
bob, Japanese games are strange
it's made by those same guys
13what is friendship fell out of sync again but oh well
I found the best video on youtube ever!
Majora's Mask was pretty weird...in an awesome way.
i guess kids would get nightmares looking at that face
ouch
Dat was....
There is an urban legend of Ben who drowned in Majora's Mask.
/me has only played Ocarina of Time 3DS
Shizuka do you test render at all?
ben?
13sort of, i make a few passes at full quality as i go
Nintendo, y u no maek Super Mario Sunshine 3D?
Yes....ben.
13mostly cause i hate fiddling with the render as settings
shizuka can I post a vid link?
is this visualboy adavnce?
Very_Silly_Filly: THIS!
i dont even want to know....
Tap Tap
THIS IS A TERRIBLE STAGE :D
right left right left righ left
Shizuka, well i meant as in rendering a small protion for quality and sync check.
:D
13if i could tell it to render just a chunk, that would be great
Football, sesame!
Hey guys I'm ba- WHAT THE FUCK?
13see that part i dunno about
Hey Firelight!
welcome back Firelight
I'm pretty sure you can preview it at around 90% quality
13alls i know is you push the button and it dumps the whole thing to a video... after an hour..
Shizuka, you know how to hightlight a portion of the time line right?
Can someoen please explain what is going on?!
13oh.. just render highlighted selection huh
Rhythm heaven
nihon games
Oh... -.-
no ur just hullucinating
Firelight: SuperBrony64 is trying out the GBA Rhythm heaven
Shizuka, well if you have something hightlighted, it would render that portion only ^^
there we go
Well, I'm about to hit the hay. Right now.. becaseu it's 12:28.

11,01Hey Panda

This game's timing is either a bit off or too strict
/me has no rhytem, this would be dubbed rhythem hell for him.
/me glomps Nittany_Discord, "what are you doing up so late?"
Nittany_Discord: its almost for in the morning you should be asleep young man
Hey Nittany_Discord!

11,01Hey MaidSurge
I'm loving this song. <3

how the hell can you see @_@
*is slow
11,01Hipster_Rush: Can't sleep.
Dken2021: Aye
bob, you don't see, the rhythm guides you
I think that camera span is what is lagging the game, or messing him up.

Nittany_Discord: liek knowing where Sumica got his pings from before he reveals it again or what some of the mods sound like or old bronystate memes that newcomers dont know yet
normal graphics for xbox and ps3
CrimsonPhoenix: Inb4 Ps4
Very_Silly_Filly, ok?
11,01The PS3 is old.
Nittany_Discord, that wasn't exactly what I was thinking, but I suppose that could work...
To be honest, Graphics reached their peaks
dead
Erm...
Nittany_Discord: Truedat, but don't forget Nintendo specialise in revolution, not graphics
Wii U will be awesome until the next group of consoles come out
Worst citizen ever
Wii U has ok graphics...which is sad, you expect astounding. :/
i dont care about the graphics the gameplay looked awsome
....
wow
5 second videos?
FUCK YEAH :D
MASF123, the thing is, Wii U may be astounding, but the developper are afraid to push their limits
13http://screensnapr.com/v/4Le8mN.png
bob, it's not about the graphics I agree the gameplay is what makes the game but nintendo should not brag about graphics 1st.

13timing fell out of sync on this clip again
at least unicorns have to use a spell to get wings
/me just hit the TOOT part. :3
Nittany_Discord: is your OC a pegasus?

Weird
11,02Never played it before :/
This isn't starfall
This is In the bay no? <.<
Dumbledor isn't a pony

11,01Also, this music is fast.
I thouht this was from the in the bay
11,01Did you speed it up?
13must have had it turned off or something last time i played
OohShiny: Your point is invalid. Everyone has a pony version. :P
13which was years ago anyway
yes! :D
Nittany_Discord: Perfect logic
No no no no no no no no
Nittany_Discord: better this way
13Vordox: the transition is that good
DANG Woman

Spell-of-Gaming, the pony version is always weaker in power, but stronger in cuteness.
Only need 0.98 game complete to level up to 10
13Nittany_Discord: it's a difference of like 1 bpm iirc
13they were almost perfect
Derpy: The masked Muffin
11,01It was muffins that took all of the thou!
Transition time
11,01Shizuka: StarsFull has a noticeable speed increase.
11,01I guess 1 bpm is noticeable.
Dat Waldo
13i forget, i mixed the two back in like march
From my studyings, I think Shining Armor is a lv 75 paladin
Nittany_Discord, I didn't notice it that much
HOW LONG HAVE I BEEN GONE PLAYING TF2!?!?! D:
13oh may actually, before i was diverted to the award show
11,01Is instrument a muffin?

blucher

Thanks for streaming SuperBrony64!
Now I'm going to bed
G'Night Bronystate

Thanks for the stream, SuperBrony64 :3

Shizuka: intermission (what I saw of it) looked great. Awesome job!
hmm......benblue3?

G'Night Everypony, may you have sweet pony dreams
Awesome intermission Shizuka
night
^
i have a tub of icecream im eating
13for those that missed it, Bronystate's Intermission 2.0 is available at http://youtu.be/zmBlxzbLj5s
Shizuka: The Toot Toot part is synched
Being unhappy with my OC I decided to make another one, only to have it follow the same thing as the others.
Shizuka, again, dat transition.
but now, I fiugred it out
DAT TRANSITION.
13Vordox: feels eeeeever so slightly out of sync still to me, but it was like the eighth time i tweaked it at 0.5x
13didn't want to deal with it anymore
13i'm bummed what is friendship fell out though...
Shizuka: It's good enough. :)
CrimsonPheonix: what?
So...who's streaming next?
I figured out my avatar, my OC, my character in the MLP universe.
cool
11,02You can also purchase the intermission on DVD for only three easy payments of $49.95 :)
:O
something so simple and so obvious I was wondering why haven't I think about it instead.
lolz
xD
SuperBrony64, where do I sign?!
I'll do that after I become a millionaire, @SuperBrony64.
SuperBrony64: Do you accept cash?
11,02Just post your credit card info in the chat
CrimsonPhoenix: better not be gray and with black highlights in the hair
thats mine
11,02Eulshy: Insert it into your CD Drive :)
TheHoodyNinja, no absolutely not
/me gets money out of wallet
it's not even Ponies
11,0120% of our proceeds go to Adopt-A-Maid, which is charity for homeless maids.
Do You Exept hugs for cash?
yep so everyone could buy what they want with my credit info
1337-othernumberothernumberuuuuhhh11.
1330% of the proceeds go to the wub fund
I don't need to be original about any colors because
CrimsonPhoenix: lemme guess its a phoenix
I'M A GO----
I put it in, it's making some weird grindy noises
/me 11,01gives Shizuka wubs
DAMMIT Hipster_Rush|
Hmm...if it were invested in MLP: FiM then I might consider donating. :/
:P
Shizuka and all german bronies deserve wubs :)
what of the other 50%?
But yeah, no need to be a Pony to enjoy the world of MLP
OMG
CrimsonPhoenix: lemme guess is it red
Is anypony going to stream or is it done for night?
Just be a changling, YOU CAN BE EVERYTHING.
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YESA YESY EYSEY SYE SYEYS EYSY EY http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyIiixA0ez0
Hipster_Rush|, it's what a phoenix looks like
have you seen a blue phoenix?
so yes then :S
13fun fact, the "Has anyone seen Dinky?" slide is the most complex, using four layers rather than three
of course
CrimsonPhoenix: actually i have, you know artists createtive license and all CrimsonPhoenix
11,01Still depressed. Just not as much.
Vordox, best version I've seen of that yet. o_o; XD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jqaA_jeZ8
13okay to be fair the what is friendship clip at least has it mostly right... just looks like they're trying to bob their heads in time and failing
Hipster_Rush|, well I'll be damn
CrimsonPhoenix: if you show me yours i'll show you mine
Wink, wink, nudge nudge.
Hipster_Rush|, it's a phoenix, just pick up any phoenix in MLP
that's it
So, without spoiling anything: Dark Knight Rises is absolutely fantastic and you should all go see it.
Ninjazz: say no more, say no more
@Nittany_Discord, I hope you feel better. I dislike depression as much as the next brony.
Shizuka: to be honest the music doesnt fit at the time, as in, the music isnt right for the head bobbing
XP
I plan on seeing it this weekend, RAWRity
;)
RAWRity, done and done. Got the tickets ready and heading out tonight! :D
OtakuTom: go out and see it right now.
13TheHoodyNinja: like i said i went over it at 0.5x speed to ensure the timing worked, render messed it up anyway
13at least now it adds quirk rather than breaking it entirely
13that would have been had i left it at the original speed
It's 3:30am here...no shows until later...plus, my fiance would hate me if I were to go see it without her :P
11,01I just need to get away from living under a family member's roof and back on my own. I don't see it as happening quick.
aww CrimsonPhoenix your no fun :D
Vordox: SFM PONEYZ:O
11,01At least live with someone else.
Just wait SirGanjalf
Give me 1 day
And I'll weed through all youtube SFM poops of ponies
:)
^good luck, sir

11,01Everyone in my family is fairly hard to live with, so it depresses me. Today was just bad because of my grandmother's friends who spend so much time complaining.
Vordox: you sure you dont need more than one day?
fuuuck
11,01Complaining about my brother. Complaining about their kids. UGH!
TheHoodyNinja: Heck, Internet is part of me. :P
In the meantime i'll post some other SFM videos
Vordox: does that mean i can download porn off of you?
I passed out on my keyboard : (
TheHoodyNinja: I only have H-anime, sorry =P
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZoqVdlaAD8&
11,01And they're aggressive-type people.
Vordox: even better!
huh, FB seems to have derped something fierce
/me rolls his tumbleweed truck in
Well I'll be damn
I do need to design my phoenix
but I can't draw :c

Vordox: This can be useful, then;) http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/351/580/40b.jpg
SirGanjalf: o_O
SirGanjalf: No it's more that...
that moment of the night when you have nothing else to do ...
Ummm SirGanjalf
nevermind. <.<
I'm kinda like that
Because real women dont dress like cats
hmm... ok then: http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/353/430/8a7.jpg

SirGanjalf: thats highly inappropiate... but yes

Nittany_Discord, you atleast moved out once it's more than what I've accomplished, I still don't have a job either.
11,01Night Shizuschlafen
11,01MASF123: I have anxiety issues that are currently preventing me from getting work. Feel life my life is almost at a dead-end right now.
Spectrum_Rush: What's innapriopriate in Big Lebowski?
Nighty night Shizuschlafen :)
I'm very sorry to hear that.
11,01I'd love to go back to school, but memory issues and ADHD will prevent that. Plus depression.
11,01So I have no clue what to do with my life right now.
Nittany_Discord: Cant let your problems run your life
Well I'll go to bed now, Nittany_Discord good luck with that. Depression is never easy to go through
i have anxiety issues also
SirGanjalf: previous pic
but before I go, SAY HELLO TO MR. HAPPY FACE http://youtu.be/LCQSpzjHxpQ
11,01Just sit here and let family drive me to a mental hospital I guess.
I don't think I'm helping you feel better...once again please forgive my rudeness.
i find the best way to get over them is to completely ignore what your mind is telling you lol
there will always be good and bad times
no one is streaming?
shut it off and push it back it doesnt work all the time but it works alot. (best way i know about dealing with it)
11,01TheHoodyNinja: I'm not doing nothing. I am getting voc rehab for work.
look forward to the good and try to forget the bad
Spectrum_Rush|: Oh, that? Joke. I'm a traditionalist in that case.
:P
11,01But you are right.
and now i confus
damn Nitt i wish i could say something to help
11,01MASF123: You're fine.
ok thanks...I always am paranoid. :)
/me yawns
11,01TheHoodyNinja: You've said something already.
/me throws a blanket on Spectrum_Rush|Zzz
I can only hope you'll feel better soon, Nittany_Discord.
/me gives Spectrum_Rush|Zzz a pillow
11,01Me too.
/me Carries Spectrum_Rush|Zzz to his bed
It's nearly 5 am. I should be sleeping, but Dark Knight Rises has me so damn wired I doubt I'll be sleeping anytime soon.
RAWRity sooo good movie ?
danke TheHoodyNinja Ninjazz Ponies47 :)
^_^
RAWRity: O.O
^^
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: fucking GREAT movie
RAWRity: never had a movie keep me riled up before, must be good
@Nittany_Discord have you've seen a psychiatrist yet? I've been planning to go see one myself actually.
Why?
11,01MASF123: Can't afford to.
11,01But I do know one to talk to over the phone.
I must see The Dark Knight Rises! ^^
^
Neither can I, but I mean later when I can find a job.
Nittany_Discord :( whats wron
wrong*
11,01That's private health care.
Nittany_Discord try getting busy with anything that helps me to get by :p
everyone should go see it.
Too bad, there are no IMAX cinemas around my place:|
My cat just scared the (squee) outta me O~O
YOu know how everyone was buzzed about Avengers? And saying it was the best Super Hero movie ever? Dark Knight Rises blows it out of the water.
/me wants a cat
when i have nothing to do i start thinking too much and then things get drepresing, one of the reasons why i hate summer, too much free time for me to handle
Season 3 is coming next month!!
really?
nipa_: new here or sumthin?
/me is going to see DKR in IMAX /)^3^(\
nipa_: We all know that. NO SPOILERS!
: D
...
11,01I need organization but not a competitive environment (yet).
nope is not
What's the specific releases date?
guys lookin for pony wallpapers for my vita any suggestions
things that have me not-so-happy: the Trailers I saw before it.
Like c'mon. I am actually screwed up, and enjoy thinking about toturing people I despise, and sometime get very suicidal thoughts, but hey, I don't care for a shrink. Also when the news report about people getting murdered horrible, I laugh. And If you remember, I laughed at 3 minutes of Natalie Portman. Everyone hated me for that ;__;
Try anything...feeling depressed is no way to go. I've almost given up many times...been thinking about suicide frequently, even around the time I 1st started coming here, but just fight it is all...like depression.
... okay... then...
*Natalie Portman crying
11,01MASF123: If they put you on meds, be very, very careful about what they put you on.
Ninjazz: bronystate, a happy place!
TheHoodyNinja, ikr?
11,01Some psych meds can make you worse.
Meds never worked on me :p
Why is that, though?
BronyState will always be a happy place
Were everything is norm
Trailers for: Jack Reacher, The Bourne Legacy, Total Recall, Man of Steel, Oz The Great and Powerful, Gangster Squad
I have to take meds. BUT I NEVER TAKE EM! :p
Nittany_Discord btw do you have a pic of your OC' draconiidon'tknowhowtospellthis
RAWRity: at least their were no oogieloves
The stream isn't on, right?
nope
Ah good
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Draconequus
not good
I've been even trying to take self-hypnosis sessions...plz give me them pills.
i will pray for all of you
Thought my PC was fucking up agn
Jack Reacher looked boring, adn I hate Tom Cruise. Bourne Legacy is unnecessary fluff. Man of Steel looks god awful boring. Oz The Great and Powerful IS A PREQUEL TO GOD DAMN WIZARD OF OZ FOR FUCK SAKE, and Gangster Squad looks decent.
But by far the best trailer: Quentin Tarantino's "Django Unchained"
11,01More sequelitis?
RAWRity i just want to watch the hobbit
^
after that i don't care
/me looks to his left and see's his dog staring at him begging for a chance to play
11,01Inb4 Wizard of Oz trilogy.
@Nittany_Discord, are you at all religious?
/me laughs and keeps typing
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_WucrXsuYo
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: well, seeing as that's TWO movie, you're gonna have to wait to see the second half.
eh better
SirGanjalf I liked that movie :)
Hmm...I don't believe in God anymore...ever since I was in like 6th grade. Now I'm an adult. Lol.
11,01TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Does it have to be colored? I don't have a properly-colored sketch of ND.
MASF123 Same here
Seriously though, As I was watching the trailer for Oz the Great and Powerful, I just started slowly facepalming.
since i can't color nope :p does not need to be colored
Because It slowly dawned on me that yes, this was really hapening, and yes, it was exactly what I thought it was.
Pwnies, and I often get it pushed by my family to believe, it's not their decision.
11,01TheGreatAndPowerfulT: http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/844/nittanydiscord001.png/
You're hyping me up, RAWRity.
11,01RAWRity: Money.
THE ENTIRE MOVIE AND BOOK WERE METAPHORS FOR THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION
11,01Why sequels? Money. Why remakes? Money.
Because here in Aus, it's kinda 50/50
11,01Why that reason? Shit economy.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_KbP0zELV0 - Why not Medic?
RAWRity: were running out of ideas for original movies
Why Money? To buy MLP toys! :D
TheHoodyNinja: make a prequel to something that ISN'T 90 years old and a classic
Some people, including myself, can't give two fucks about religion
RAWRity: I cant do it
so dont tell me too
hell, you want to make a movie based on pre-existing content, hurry up and make a god damn Flash movie
if don't mind me asking the botom leg is from what ?
i dont belong to any religion, but i dont deny their existance
Hell, they're already planning a Batman reboot for the inevitable Justice League movie.
i believe all the gods are roomates
I often come here to get rid of boredom, but I lose some much time in that process... :/
Yeah I thought so'
the only religion i cant stand is scientology
11,01Don't get mad about it.
Aus is really leaning towards Atheist
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weMpv14cW9U
Mostly everyone I know is Atheist
I think ever religion is wrong is and is merely just a believe to help guide people in the right direction with morals and stories.
every
11,01A lot of people are turned away from religion because of extremists that shove their beliefs down other's throats.
11,01Or condemn everyone that doesn't think they way they do.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lB6rCf7BIgY
Meh, my feeling on religion and faith in general is that if it makes you happy or comforts you, good for you, keep at it.
And allow others to find what makes them happy.
11,01Exactly.
11,01RAWRity.
I pretend to worship fim to troll my friend
I agree with MASF123. Religion was created by people of much higher intelligence, to make them have some motivation, to actually have a life.
I'm not religious myself, but I've seen many of my friends find comfort through faith, and I'd never try to take that away from them.
people will believe what they want to believe
Any Flying Spaghetti Monster worshippers, here?
SirGanjalf: my sisters not a brony
I've really just came to the decision that whatever happens when I die, will happen. Until then, I'll try to steer away from my Anxiety and Suicidal thoughts :P
as long as no one try to shove their religion down my throat you can keep with it
TheHoodyNinja: Since i'm a brony, i was thinking "about" converting to Invisible Pink Unicorn cult:p
*"converting", wrong quote fail
SirGanjalf: a pink unicorn would be terrible, i mean, imagin a g4 unicorn with pink colors
I was schooled up until the 7th Grade to believe in God
ahh we talking about religon eh?
well then
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: go back to sleep
it seems there are not a lot of topics at this time
TheHoodyNinja: but i don't want to :'(
But I just went one day "Wait a bloody moment"
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: fine, you can stay
TheHoodyNinja: But it's invisible! No aestethic worries.
SirGanjalf: if its invisible its not pink, its clear
/me Picks Spectrum_Rush|Zzz up "Ok mister back to bed" Puts Spectrum_Rush|Zzz back in his bed and ties him down to it
TheHoodyNinja: nah i'll go, just going to leave this adorable pic for all of ya ;) http://derpiboo.ru/images/50141
/me is getting pains in his stomach from the Anxiety he's getting talking about this
11,01But, I could never get into going to church.
Pwnies: how do you get anxiety from talking on the internet?
Nittany_Discord, same. Went to church a few times, but stopped because my parents thought it was inconvenient.
TheHoodyNinja : I don't know. But sometimes it really fucking hurts
SuperBrony64: y u no steam
TheHoodyNinja: That's the whole point - it's supertnatural because it can be both pink AND invisible(mindf**k, i know):P
Pwnies: did you drink milk that was nine days past the exp date?
/me is ignored
SirGanjalf: No, you'll have to compromise, this must make sense. One or the other
/me Hugs Spectrum_Rush|Zzz
TheHoodyNinja : That's the thing, I'm lactose-intolerant, that causes Anxiety too :(
/me puts Spectrum_Rush|Zzz in a bucket
Pwnies: got anxiety? better drink my own piss
TheHoodyNinja: Hmm... I'll just with FSM then.
did any of ya'll even look at that pic I left :(

Chrysalis, its not hanging when you are around ^^
SirGanjalf : Do you make these? Or just like the uploader?
i'm such a bastard
My Reaction to the picture Spectrum_Rush|Zzz gave a link to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKNsDmmJmLc
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: I just played TF2 for 2 and 1/2 hours! D:
Pwnies: Neither make, nor upload - just like them:)
omg who touched sandvich
^I DID!
MUAHAHA
LETS TALK ABOUT MUSIC GENRES
*noms sandvich*
wubwubwubwubwubwubwubwubwubw
Metal. Nuff said.
Ahem
i like jazz
Naw, I'm just kidding, I got broad tastes. :D
...holy shit
I've had a weird Music taste.
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz, me too. :D
Vegetarian Progressive Grindcore
Ninjazz: /)
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz (\
but yeah broad tastes
apparently a Dark Knight Rises midnight showing was disrupted by 2 gunmen. 10 people are dead...
^O:
:p
Hello Ninjazz! :)
RAWRity, wtf...
I liked anything popular when I was younger, then got into rock, then bands like SlipKnot, then got into Dubstep/House
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: Why you give link to scary picture!?! D:
RAWRity: well that sucks
Seriously?
yeah
Heyo, MadSurge. ^_^
http://news.sky.com/story/962756/ten-shot-dead-at-batman-film-premiere
RAWRity, why?... Any reason?
my answer
Hello everyone :)
Ninjazz: no reason given yet
hey max :D
it's was only a couple hours ago, and one of the gunmen is still on the loose.
WOW. That's pretty brutal
Well... damn... that's just fucking senseless.
Even by my standards, I didn't lol.
Ok maybe a bit
Hello there, MaxTheSwedishBrony. Welcome back.
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: I'm waiting on the link to load
God I'm fucked up
:)
Ponies47: it shouldnt take that long D:
okay then im going to ignore that for now
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: MY COMPUTER IS 9 YEARS OLD! EVERYPONY KNOWS THIS! GIMME A BREAK! :P
but seriously, that's just...awful
:P
Ponies47: 9 years really?
11,01Give his 47 ponies a break!
TheHoodyNinja: Yes -_-
...
and here is the US's yearly shooting folks
Nittany_Discord: but he was able to see my prevoius pic in short time just fine
OK, last but not least(EPIC in fact) video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkP_sJty7EY
Ok...my laptop had to restart, why did I miss?
/me realises that he shouldn't be alive if all he does is surf the web and :D at murder reports
what
RAWRity: people will be fucking stupid, fact of life
TheHoodyNinja: this isn't about stupidity. This is about pure senseless malice and destruction.
MASF123: you missed this http://news.sky.com/story/962756/ten-shot-dead-at-batman-film-premiere
Hmm...should I even click that? I don't trust that link.
That's just fucked up.
RAWRity: which can boil down to complete stupidity and lack of respect for human life, but it is really messed up
MASF123, it's a news report.
11,01RAWRity: Oh joy. Idiots!
They must really hate Batman *applause*
Brutes. Degenerates. Fucking psychos.
Awww he left
Let's tell some tasteless jokes
Nittany_Discord: ...that's an insult to idiots. Idiots point batman symbol flashlights at the screen during the opening credits. These people are murderous piles of scum.
11,01Ryunosuke: I don't think idiots with guns is a problem limited to the US.
Is isn't
Pwnies: surprisingly no
oh shit its 4:20
But even though Aus has it's flaws, the whole Guns restricted to people who aren't fucking psychos is a good law
so whos going to stream next? wait let me guess sumica right?
TheHoodyNinja : GOTTA SMOKE DAT WEED
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: STILL LOADING -_-
Ponies47: -_(\
i better get to sleep guys http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4692/ seeya
it would seem these guys were using automatic weapons, which are illegal for non-military personel. So it's not about laws here, as they circumvented the laws to get them anyway.
Ponies 47 Noone is streaming
Just wait, there will be speculations connecting what's just happened to the plot of the movies,
well its been loading for like an hour
NO ONE IS STREAMING
he's talking about a pic i linked him
ok...my laptop is uber lagging...so no I will look at the report.
GET THAT INTO YOUR THICK SKULLS
ok chill out guys
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: FINALLY! And Wtf? O_o
now.
Freaking Keyboard. Wow.
Ponies47: wat its not creepy?
Post your Computer
Ponies47: unless... can you see the secret?
Acer Aspire 4gb 500gb Nvidia 500gt Graphics
...
DO IT
oh my fuck.
Nittany_Discord, no, but it seems that the ones in the US get the news all worked up
11,01Dunno.
one of the people who got shot was a baby.
Ryunosuke: I'd say mass shootings in general get the news worked up
Because no-one cares if a family in Russia get shot. It is about who's the popular cuntry
Not sure I want to know what's going on.
Kammerjunk: this is going on: http://news.sky.com/story/962756/ten-shot-dead-at-batman-film-premiere
10 PEOPLE SHOT A BATMAN SCREENING THERE DONE
11,01People get shot all of the time in the US as well.
Well, that's a strange event to shoot people at.
11,01I guess it was because it happened at a movie premiere.
I mean, Batman doesn't even use guns.
11,01A rare event in itself.
Makes sense, I suppose.
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: Oh I see and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKNsDmmJmLc
thats probably some sick irony
true
apparently a baby got shot too
11,01RAWRity: Is that near your location?
That's the point. US is crazy about the gun laws. GUNS KILL PEOPLE NOT THE PEOPLE THEM SELVES. Be like Aus, RESTRICT THE GODDAMN GUNS
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: Just what i thought
Nittany_Discord: no, couple time zones from me.
Pwnies: um, sorry, no.
11,01K.
lol.
Like, please, don't turn this into some advocacy for gun restriction or something.
Hoping you guys will see the irony in there
11,01People using guns kill people.
^
11,01Guns were designed to kill.
11,01A necessary evil.
/me Looks at clock
So why give people a right to have a gun?
To defend themselvs if necessary.
This is a tragedy, not a place for you to soap box about gun rights.
Ponies47: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yGJGTjV2WE
O_O
You don't wanna know what time it is here O~O
11,01Ponies47 time?
That's like give a country a Nuclear Missle and saying, SHOOT US, and then getting mad when people die
11,01It's Ponies47 time!
11,01:p
5:30am
7:27 PM
Sydney FTW
It also appears I have killed the chat. Good job Ponies47
Good job
guns dont kill people
bullets do
aaand body count's up to 14
with 50 others injured.
jesus...
But these shootings are constantly happening, and people just go "Well fuck logic" EVERYONE HAVE A GUN
It dosen't make sense
I don't even see what motive they would have.
http://www.9news.com/video/9newsonline.aspx -- live feed apparently
WELCOME TO BRONYSTATE LATE HOUR, WHERE WE TALK ABOUT MASS SHOOTINGS... and ponies
Pwnies: again, this is not the time for you to bitch about your personal boogie man.
Aus restricted guns after the firt major shooting, 16 dead if a remember
Kammerjunk: Psychofans? "Agents of Chaos"?
SirGanjalf: ...The Joker?
Kammerjunk: most likely, sick fucks who wanted a large crowd packed into a small area
11,01Pwnies: What year?
Kammerjunk: http://i.imgur.com/hcLN5.gif
RAWRity: Suppose that makes sense,
Nittany_Discord: You silly :P
Kammerjunk: As i wrote before: There surely will be some speculations about This thing and movie(s) plot
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: Hai.
we have restrictions on firearms etc. HOWEVER, the problem is..if someone is going to go on a shooting spree, I dont really think gun laws are the FIRST thing they are going to be thinking about
:P
hey guys
1984.
Ok I just read the report...forgive me for taking so long...this crappy laptop just loooves to lag.
11,01We do have gun restrictions in the US.
That sparked the debate on guns, which lead to gun laws
Not very good ones though
Any particular reason why they shot 10 people?
11,01You can't just go to the store and buy a firearm like you buy a bottle of soda.
MASF123: Best guess? They could.
I know
hey guys
Good morning everyone.
Ryunosuke: and seeing as the gunmen in this story were using weapons that are illegal for purchase by citizens, it's clear that gun laws didn't exactly stop them.
:I
how you doing Starflash
this is true Nittany_Discord
hi alexxm and Starflash
That's one loud PING noise...
Hey Starflash!
But in 10 days someone's motivation to murder someone probably won't dissapte
I come in, first thing I see: seriously weird remark about soda bottles. Dat Nitt :3
Starflash: http://news.sky.com/story/962756/ten-shot-dead-at-batman-film-premiere
So are there checkpoints or anything between states in the US?
that's what we're discussing atm
hey SirGanjalf how've you been
11,01Hi Starflash.
RAWRity... what the...
Kammerjunk: depends on the state.
Because surely some states are more lenient on gun laws than others.
Here you need a license even for the puniest gun.
11,01Checkpoints?
That's not really funny and stuff.
11,01They'll set something up.
Something happens for a reason though...
alexxm: OK, thought i've made idiot of myself here on chat
*thoug
*though
Kammerjunk: but generally speaking, no. Only way you get busted for a gun is if you get pulled over for something else and they find on your person/in your car.
how come SirGanjalf
dang keyboard
11,01I've never had to stop when I cross a state line.
RAWRity: Fair enough.
11,01And I've crossed many state lines.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_Colorado
alexxm: I've posted this: http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/351/580/40b.jpg, and now some people may think that i'm into this stuff:P
weapon laws varies by state
unless there's an actual gunmen on the loose and near state lines, they generally don't set anything up, simply because most police departments don't have the resources or man power.
So what was this all about. Film critics?
In reality, I really don't see why the US dosen't reconsider the gun laws. It's like watching your house burn down, while thinking "Hmmm... Should I call the Fire Brigade? Hmmm nah"
SirGanjalf lol
Starflash: nobody's sure yet. Story's only a couple hours old.
lol indeed:|
Sounds bad in any case.
:I
Pwnies: Guns are illegal here, period. Hasn't stopped shooting so far.
well alot of people do carry for self protection
which is why you dont hear about mass shootings in Texas very often
Why did they kill 10 people? Did they ask them why, did they get away? Oh wait...Fox News reported this, I guess we'll never get the full story as usual.
And I'll state again: usually shooters gained their guns through illegal means.
actually, at the 1st of July, knives became illegal here
alexxm: Anyway, screw this. That TDKR premiere incident is real news now.
Wait what?
MASF123, AP reported it
11,01We're more concerned with stupid things. If anyone even whispers "gun control," the conservatives would have a shit fit.
11,01Or anyone.
Knives? Like a Machete?
so now it's pretty much illegal to carry your kitchen knife outside ^^"
WOW
Hmm...it said Fox News somewhere in that article...
See why though
MASF123: the story is only a couple hours old, and one of the 2 shooters is still on the loose.
Uh oh popoo
I guess, Pwnies
Ello there everypony.
yes, the local Fox news station was reporting for that article.
Ey Malavolent.
you see, that is why i cannot in good concience live in the UK
uh oh poo poo
RAWRity, that's crazy...so one guy escaped?
Starflash: What if you need to cut something? Only scissors?
11,01Let's not spend millions going to the moon. Let's waste millions writing internet censorship laws!
SirGanjalf: you can have blades in your house.
MASF123: yeah, they've detained the other guy and are searching for the loose one atm.
I have a firm belief that I shall always be secure in my person, even if that means dealing with the situation in a more... permenent fashion
Well I guess the US you have a giant population, so there would be more Psychos
11,01Bad statement there.
Hmm
we really need to make this a thing about the US now?
It's a goddamn PonyVille here compared to what hear about the US
I didnt say that I would kill out of anything, but as a last resort
Here it's: let's not spend millions in education, Let's build combat planes noone's gonna use!
Starflash: Oh right, now i understand. I thought "carry you knife OUTSIDE kitchen" ^^'
Or did you forget the Norway madman who killed 90 some people last year?
nah, I mean out in the open, SirGanjalf
Pwnies, would make sense the more people you have the higher probablity of getting good or bad people.
Knives, that's another thing. Over here, you can't legally buy a knife over 7 cm. However, I can go down to the store and buy a gigantic goddamn knife for my "kitchen".
11,01We use them.
The worst story here is a kid getting Punched in the face once, killing him because some guy was mad
Ikr Kammerjunk
hmm... It doesn't sound like a healthy dude though if you die from a punch to the face
the depressing levels in this chat are to dan high, we need some cuteness http://derpiboo.ru/10724
Actually if you hit someone hard enough, it'll kill them in one shot
Yes I agree...it's getting me depressed too.
Oh, I know! Nation-wide anger management therapy! Wheeee
Pony time! :)
Assuming you're not a fucking midget
well, I'm off to bed then. See you all later.
Hah
Pwnies: Protip: duck!
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: http://derpy.me/2UvXV
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: I want that replacing the cats.exe program :D
Gnight, RAWRity. Sleep well.
And dream of BATMAN! :D
Anyway, I hope there's a small chance that maybe no one really got hurt and that's just some weird viral campaign.
MadSurge: ikr
night RAWRity
(But doubt in that, tbh)
Ninjazz: most likely gonna dream of this shit, but *shrugs*
Gnight RAWRity
I hope not :I
night RAWRity thanks for buming us all out :), i kid
There's always going to be Psycho's it's just a matter of placing laws to stop them
RAWRity, just gotta be positive, man. I'm sure those fuck will be caught.
Good Night RAWRity, as usual dream of ponies.
Pwnies: If they're a psycho...laws mean nothing to them.
I hope so, Ninjazz o_o
Hey ponies, I'm back from my nothingness
I know I had more d'aww pictures somewhere, but with 130+ tabs, they're hard to find.
Sweet dreams, RAWRity.
I mean.
as for knives, AFAIK, Switchblades and Ballistic knives are illegal, anything else is up to state and local laws, usually by blade length
130 TABS WUT
Ninjazz, I've seen many situations where crooks got away...but THEY WILL get caught eventually. -_-
Kammerjunk: would you like to see an adorable pic i linked earlier?
UR KIDDING ME RIGHT
Ryunosuke: The way I understand it, you're not allowed to have a knife if it can be kept in your pocket and opened with one hand.
Pwnies: Psychos can be pretty inpredictable from what i've heard. Therefore no sure way to prevent their acts.
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: I always like d'aww.
oh marvelous
MASF123, that's why I'm saying let's just hope.
Seriously, if you're honestly willing to murder a theatre full of innocent people, gun prohibition isn't going to suddenly dissuade you. This isn't about gun restrictions or anything else. It's about 2 sick fucks hurting and killing people.
^
again, it varies by state
There's no sure fire way to prevent them, but restricting guns to the general public is a good one
SirGanjalf, that;s because they think very differently for normal people.
than
^well, duh
RAWRity: Of course, but that won't stop people from using the argument for gun control.
Kammerjunk: i know
I have to disagree Pwnies
Eheh, they're criminals, they'll get the guns if they really want them.
but anyways, off to bed.
Yeah.
Actually, brain damage can possibly lead to being a dick.
Ninjazz, I know I hope they get caught too I'm just saying it's least likely...I mean, you know what I mean dammit.\
if you restrict guns from the general populace, then the ONLY people who are going to have guns are police and criminals, and police cannot be everywhere at once
/me hugs MASF123 "I know, I know"
What, a guy that kills off a bunch of people can't get caught? that's pretty bad :I
Ryunosuke, exactly. Removing the chance for the normal person to defend himself.
Ninjazz...I'm still unconfortable about the whole hugging thing...sadly I've been a brony for 6 months and am still not used to it. Even in Bronycon I couldn't do it. :/
Ryunosuke : Yes, but would you rather EVERYONE have a gun, or just the people who enforce the rules?
But if everyone has the right to defend himself, people will end up shooting eachother.
This kinda reminds me of that guy who shot some people in France not so long ago. Really hard to predict, and therefore to prevent shit like that.
I'm not saying you can prevent every shooting, but restricting guns can help
MASF123, I'm just trying to comfort you, sorry. :c
again, not a small number of people use firearms for self protection
How about, actually improve the police? As in less screwing around and more paying attention to guarding safety.
not to mention where I live, Sport Hunting is also prevelant
/me ok here http://derpiboo.ru/3002 Kammerjunk tis the pic i linked earlier that everpony in chat just love love loved how adorable it was ;)
: D
Ninjazz, no it's ok...I just wish I wasn't such a homophobe...not sying your one...it's just a bad experience I had as a kid. Haha. :D
I take it, then, that I'm not the only one who thinks Dashie is more cute than awesome.
MASF123, Ah. I see. >_< Well, just know every hug I give is just friendly. :)
Nope, you are not the only one :D
People use guns because they don't use rational thinking. Are you going to live the rest of your life know that you blew a robber head of because he was broke and needed cash?
Pwnies: Yeah, but according to news, those guys were using automatic weapons, which are prohibited i think
Kammerjunk, same.
MASF123: Hey, I'm also uncomfortable about the whole "hugging" thing. But that's more because I can't into social.
besides, we have that pesky 2nd ammendment that guarantees the right to bear arms, written for the explicit purpose of self defence
Kammerjunk: you could say that, why not ask everypony else what they thought of my pic when i linked it earlier
Ninjazz, of course, we're all friends here.
^_^
SirGanjalf : yeah i know. I'm just saying that the amount of shooting could be reduced with gun restrictiom
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: I was probably asleep, trying to procrastinate waking up so I wouldn't feel like shit.
^i undestand
Silly throat infections.
let me ask this, if someone decides to ram a car into said crowd, should we ban all automobiles in the US?
Kammerjunk, I'm am kind of anti-social too, I limit to talking to some nice people.
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz, why are all the pictures you send so full of daw and awesome? :D
Ryunosuke: God knows someone would try.
No, because Cars aren't designed to kill
Guns are
Guns are made for the military to kill
Guns are made for Hunters to kill
you can shoot NOT to kill you know
But cars can kill. It's been proven.
yes
Guns don't kill people, people kill people with guns.
My point
Guns are made for shooting into the air dramatically.
its not really about guns now
yes Ninjazz so full of daww and awesome http://derpiboo.ru/50141 o_____o
people can kill people with ... really anything
yes
11,01Getting light outside. Time to try and get some sleep.
MASF123: Guns don't kill people, people kill people = Toast don't toast toast, toast toast toast.
Gnight, Nittany_Discord. Sleep well.
...I don't know.
But guns are SPECIFICALLY made to kil
Night, Nittany_Discord.
Gnight..or day, Nittany_Discord~
Nittany_Discord: wat ever you do dont click that link if ya want to sleep
And then you get scared when someone KILLS someome with agun'
Wait, so these 14 overly over the top killing machines I own were NOT made to kill?
Well im off to bed everypony talk to yall in the moring ok so please don't turn me into a bad mood please
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz, GRAGH! YOU... BASTURD! DX
Nightyn ight Nittany_Discord
hahhhahhah
*Nighty night
/me can't breathe
night dude
Even if we got rid of guns, humans will still find a way to kill one another. :/
ye
So, my nuclear missile cannon wasn't made to kill? :c
That sucks
look at the knife legislation in the UK
11,01The creepy dash one Spectrum_Rush|Zzz?
Humans will always kill one another
Guns are made to propel bullets, shells or other missiles by explosive force, typically making a characteristic loud, sharp noise.
Nittany_Discord: maybe
It's just a matter of reducing the number of victims
Dear Level Up, MMORPGs do not work that way. Sincerely, video gamers.
11,01Didn't bother me.
exactly, it's in our nature...we LOVE violence.
AND I ZOOMED IN. FML.
Prove me wrong.
:D
A person can't really kill 14 people with a toothbrush
Besides, even if we didn't have guns, I'd still have the plasmaquantum phaseblade
Very_Silly_Filly: wat
nite Nittany_Discord cya later
Kammerjunk: So... bullets kill people? ALLOW ALL GUNS! BAN ALL BULLETS!
LOL
Perfect!
I'M SO FUNNY
SirGanjalf: I support this.
Ninjazz: Ninjazz Ninjazz smh
HAHHAHAHAHAHHAH
no
Pwnies: I don't even.
Use blanks
again, if you ban all g uns, then the only ones having guns are criminals
Better idea
Pwnies, you can stab someone in the eye with a toothbrush or choke someone wih sticking it down their esophagus.
and police
Ryunosuke: Guns are banned in Denmark. Doesn't stop shootings.
It's an alloy, of Quantum metal, and Plasmamatic metal. Generates electicirt and can burn, freeze, electrocute, cut and for some reason, makes the target wet
point exactly
Amnesia in Summer Sale? Nonononono.
MASF123 : But you can't kill 14 people in a ciinema all at once can you
My point is that if you're set on killing someone, you're hardly going to let the law get in your way.
wow, that is some crazy shit that went down
Pwnies: You obviously haven't met me
Is flamethrower considered as a gun?
Pwnies, True...that would require more firepower, ou only have 1 toothbrush... :/
isnt tear gas a ... restriced material?
Very_Silly_Filly : You can kill 14 people within 2 minutes with a toothbrush
Depends what country
I'm planning to buy Plants Vs Zombies on Steam.
MASF123, you're going to need MAOR toothbrushes.
Which is the only thing I can afford that I want. :I
OH GOD I GOTTA BOARD UP MY WINDOWS
/me has went through tear gas training, NOT FUN
in theory its a restricted matrieal
hmm
gas canisters can be bought, maybe not teargas
This whole argument is funny to me.
Hi
/me has gone through a week without internet, NOT FUN
umm if it was fully automatic, it would have been illegal anyway
Ninjazz, and they said a toothbrush couldn't be used as a weapon. :D Well I showed them!
PuddingCupz: Hi! We're talking about guns! :D
I LOVE ME SOME GUNS! PEW PEW!
how you doing PuddingCupz
PuddingCupz: Hello. and bullets.
OH GOD YU SHOT ME NINJAZZ
Im good.
AHAHHAHAHAH
"Go to the movies," they said. "See Batman," they said.
THE PAIN
probably requires a special license required, but that doesn't matter if it was aquired illegally
Whats the mocie gonna be??
Kammerjunk: Get some popcorn, they said
Pwnies, I wasn't aiming. :T
WELL SAY SOWWEZZ
Kammerjunk, "Don't bring a Flak jakcet," they said.
Whats the movie does anyone know?
Very_Silly_Filly: You know, people were probably saved by popcorn.
Since they weren't in the same room as the gunman.
Kammerjunk: "Just wait here, and stay still" they said
Unfortuantely, popcorn is the one thing I don't have that's equipped with some high-tech weapons
Where was Batman, when this all happened at HIS movie premeire? :O
"Watch an action movie" they said
I want high-tech popcorn. We really have been lacking on the pop-tech lately.
Omg is the movie batman arkham city?!?
MASF123: It happened in Denver, not Gotham
HAM city :D
SirGanjalf, same shit different toilet.
^lol
Isn't Arkham City a game?
^it is
wait duh.
BATMAN WATCHED 14 PEOPLE DIE TODAY. AND JUST GOT WITH CATWOMAN

What sketch...

Heyo, Pinkies4thWall. I do think it has been a while since I last saw you.
Seems fun.
SHOULD I GO PLAY MY PS3 IN MY HEATED BEDROOM?
OR STAY HERE COLD AS GODDAMN FUCK
MASF123: accepted
PS3? Lucky you. :P
Got a 2 litre bottle of blackcurrent juice for myself
Jum
I don't even own a console!
I think.
Ninjazz: i caught pneumonia 2 weeks ago, so i was in the hospital
PS3 And a Xbox360 :D

Wait, no. I -think- I have a PS2.
Not sure.

Pinkies4thWall: pneumatics is stuff to do with air right? So problems with respiration?
Your name keeps popping up in Xbox lately...Nightmaire Moon and @SuperBrony64 have you as a friend and some other account I checked.
And a 72" LCD TV
:D
Oh piss off, I'm still on my 42" Telly
:D
And my gaming Laptop
I have a 50" TV downstairs. I don't watch TV.

All I could afforf
Ninjazz: yes. still coughing now and then, but i'm okay

I BOUGHT A GODDAMN MS3
PS3
disappointing as in I expected worse
MASF123: :D
/me hugs Pinkies4thWall "That's good. Glad to hear that" ^_^
WHAT ELSE COULD I BUY
Can't be arsed to do anything atm
...A desktop?
Not for $600
NO WAY
Seriously, if you can stuff it into a laptop, you can stuff better stuff into a desktop.
It's 6:03 a.m. and I am still on freaking Bronystate...somepony help me!
This thing still runs all my games MED-HIGH quality
How new is it?
Also need to move around a lot
My games look pretty crisp
Hey Very_Silly_Filly! :)
/me hugs Very_Silly_Filly
And I have no where for a Desktop :D
Heyup, you both
Pwnies: My desktop computer has a handle. I can carry it around! :D
To many consoles and TV's
Getting too late, need sleep. Going now. Night, everyone.
Sweet dreams, Ninjazz.
I wanna get a small telly for my PC
/me is a sad mango for having crappy specs
But when my laptop is fixed, I won't need one
In my house I have hmmmm...
I'm fine with two 24" monitors.
6 TV's
Kammerjunk, very efficient, Twilight Approved!
Because my laptop is like 132% better than my PC
2 Laptops and a Desktop
Since, you know, I'm sitting 40 cm from the screens.
A PS3
MASF123: you still play borderlands?
An XBOX360
I still have it.
Why would you want that, anyway.
MASF123: also, BEST GAMER PIC EVER
2 iPod's
I have it on Steam, but it's not downloaded
A iPhone
It puzzles me. But then again, I don't play racing games or fighting games.
iPad
Haha! I love my pic.
Plus this shitbox can't run it anyway
:why:
/me wants an xbox live cam
not the best
Still play's my music good
WUBUBBUUBWBUBWUWBUWB

My Xbox is the best shitbox.
I has an iPod, iPad but no iPhone
Need to wait 'till chrimbo before I get my iPhone :3
I don't play the Secksbawx 360

TOO SHIT
alexxm: Which version?
Second best day of my life was when I replaced my iPhone with a Samsung Galaxy.
:D
OH GOD THAT PHONE IS AWESOME
So, I was playing Xbox today, and I met a guy who lives a few miles from where I do
SII
Is best
Very_Silly_Filly i don't know sorry
alexxm: When did you get it?
Pwnies: Do you play racing games and/or fighting games on your consoles?
oh dear
Because that's the only reason I'd want a console.
december Very_Silly_Filly
Except I don't play either.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTAcQKI3nAI -- what you should do when your streaming server repeatedly fails
alexxm: Most likely iPad2
Kammerjunk : I used too, but then got into FPS. I do have some racing/fighting games on my laptop though'
ok then thanks Very_Silly_Filly

Ryunosuke: I don't easily get upset, but that video makes me feel even more sick than I already am.
:D
NOT THAT GAME
THAT GAME IS FUCKING SO HARD
IT'S NOT EVEM FUNNY
Pwnies: Dark Souls.

The sad part is, that PC is probably pissing all over mine
harder than that
I would of happily robbed it at the last minute
I haven't played Gaiden, TBH.

I would do anything for Terraria, I would even kill a klondike bar. :3
WOOOO
:D
3No, vote for it, silly. But you don't have to if you would rather have Splinter Cell of something
I don't even know what a klondike bar tastes like.
00,02SlurryMoon, i'm not much for turn based rpg's
00,02oh
00,02will do
I have Terarria and I played it for 10 seconds and quit
Kammerjunk: Me either. :3
I DIDN'T BUY IT :D
Friend did
Beep
ON MY ACCOUNT
:D
I played Terraria for a while back when Molten Armor was the shit.
00,02i have soo many games now
00,02its scary
Then I stopped.
Phase4: How many?
Phase4: Did you buy publisher packs?
00,02Very_Silly_Filly, 61
3I have 126
Pah, I have 194
00,022 beta's and 5 is 1
My friend has 367
Holy shiz, 367?
YEAH
wat
...I got 75.
._.
00,02Pwnies, your friend can play more than one game a day
00,02for an entire year
ikr Phase4
:D
Obviously
I've had a Steam account since '04, so I've had plenty of time to accumulate games for it
/me has 39 games but still can't play any of them
Hm. I have 112 games or something.
MadSurge: why not?
00,02lol wtf
how come MadSurge
who is loggd in as me.
Hello?
MASF123 is not him?
I mean me.
Starflash and alexxm: this laptop can't run them :D
hey wtf how've you been
3heheh... I've had a steam account not even a year, and most of my games are either free or very very cheap
Aw :T
i always know it is phase streaming because of the pony on the side
I have around 500 quidsworth in steam games
00,02so, kerbal skyrim or fallout 3
...
So I bought a 2 TB hard drive like 2-3 months ago (HDD, not SSD). I'm going to need a new one soon.
3I mean, I get them mainly during sales
00,02^ SlurryMoon
Phase4: Kerbal of course
kerbal!
00,02this steam sale has been the single largest purchase streak ever
Kerbal?
00,02for me at least
Kammerjunk: WHAT? I can barely fill a 250GB HD
Sadly the only thing I ever loved enough to put money into was TF2
Um...can some mod help me?
3yeah...
3though I've spent way too much
Kabaka: I think I'm laughing more than I should be.
TAB FAIL.
00,02SlurryMoon, me too
:P
Someone appears to be logged in as me, is it a glitch?
Best hat in TF2
Unusual Mining Light
YAY
Derpy123: Yeah, you've ghosted
Very_Silly_Filly: That's not even all of it. I have a fileserver connected to LAN with over 1 TB of video.
3there's only one game that I really want that still hasn't gone on much of a discount
1st tab fail. he.
WITH FUCKING FLIES
:(
3and that's Quantum Conumdrum
Ok...it fixed. gonna switch back.
00,02SlurryMoon, i'd say its worth $13
SlurryMoon: All the Quantum technology belongs to me.
Steam sales are a strike of genius for me. Makes you willing to buy games and support indie developers :D
/me 00,02got it during pre order
Very_Silly_Filly: I suppose my hard drive filling can be attributed to me plundering everything I can.
3well, I know, but I really would like to get it on sale
Ok...well that was a weird experience.
Considering I used about 7 billion quids worth to make my things
Gabe Newell is best man
3I mean more than 10% off
Kammerjunk: Mine's very very fragmented and still fine :S
Heya , who is streaming?
He actually isn't fat
00,02MaxTheSwedishBrony, Yo
He's just swallowed every copy of episode 3
Very_Silly_Filly, hat does ghost mean exactly?
I don't really care about Gabe's weight, because he's not the only fat person on earth
00,02Pwnies, are we thinking about the same man?
Ah :) Phase4
00,02XD
00,02Pwnies, o u
Pwnies: yep :D
Phase4: have i ever told you about pinkie pie?
what
00,02Pinkies4thWall, i dont belive so
Very_Silly_Filly: He's not even the fattest. Far from it.
Phase4: shootin' for minmus today?
WHERE IS MY EPISODE 3
00,02Spectrum_Rush|Shrugs, might
Phase4: why do you have a + in front of your name and not the other mod
Actually on that note
Phase4: she's crazy
seatsea: It means he's a techie.
00,02seatsea, i'm tech, not a mod
I should finish Episode 2
MASF123: A ghost is a unliving figure. So it means the taken name is an unliving figure
:3
00,02i makes sures the tubes are all oiled
Which will eventually go soon
00,02i like this song
Phase4: oh ok
Phase4: If we catch your drift?
This is a good song.
00,02Kammerjunk, o u 6_9
Phase4: Was it you who programmed the refresh buttons: Ergo the reason for you being a techie??
00,02Very_Silly_Filly, yup
00,02wonder if its still there
I wanna play Borderlands
Well, good on ya. The refresh button is good for when Flash decides to be a silly filly and crash.
But then I don't want to
Is there any command in the chat that disables the ping noises?
I blame SaxyPretender, though.
i have no idea
Pwnies: xbox?
STEAM
dammit
MASF123: Nope. and this is irony.
PANICING
00,02lol, here it is http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/119609
AAAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA
Hi everyone, how's it going?
Anyone have a PS3? Or a steam account?
I would join you, but it is like 6:22 a.m. here. Mother of Celestia I am beyond tired.
Pwnies: I have a PS3.
I have Steam. :I
Yeah, but I'm not adding bronies
Pwnies: I hate the latter.
Pwnies: And Steam.
Pwnies: I have*
Pretty good.
lol is this Phase4's flapping plane?
AdamTheDuck: The rounding error one?
Spell, I won't type your name fully because it will PING, But I heard what you said.
I just want someone to play with since all my friends playthe most absurd games :___:
00,02AdamTheDuck, now with less flapping
awwww, that's a pitty.
Pwnies: Like what?
Phase4: do a barrel roll!
Napoleon : Total War
DO A BARREL ROLL
DO IT
MASF, Get a irc client, mp3 file with no sound at all, change settings, done.
I need to learn to use IRC
dose barrel rolls.
YEAH
Robbaz made the Valhala Dual Penatrator Mark ll
Pwnies: http://derpy.me/bronystatebacklog Boom.
DOUBLE DOSE TIME
Wait, no. Wrong link
goddammit
Wat?
Pwnies: http://derpy.me/aOWQ9 - There. BronyState Gaming thingamagik.
Spell I'm bad with this software engineering, so forget that crap.
Why does send
:D
Pwnies: First one was wrong link.
FUCK YEAH
WOOO
Oh yes. This song.
hello everypony
I think it is enough that we get our own names in bold, but the PING noise seems unneccesary.
it flyes prety well with only one roket
Hello firepaw!
PING!
Pwnies, I can see you typing in real-time. :3
:D
lol
...Is it bad if I know the Dovah parts of this song?
Cool.
God, this landing reminds of the most painful Blast Corps level ever
The shuttle level was a bitch on platinum
wonky
Blast Corps...I never got into it. :/
00,02they realy need to fix the fuel
00,02it drains from one tank at a time
00,02screws up the balance real fast
Is the fuel grouped? Phase4 ?
Also, he may or may not have pronounced that wrong. As far as I know, "aa" is pronounced like in "thAt" or "relAx", but he pronounced it like either "ah" (tAll, enthrAll) or just "a".
00,02Very_Silly_Filly, not sure what you meen
+Phase4, you mind if I send you a link. You don't have to stream it just view it at your own time.
so is the dark knight rises good
Like on the rocket, all the compartments are in a group when there's a number of them
00,02MASF123, sure
00,02Very_Silly_Filly, oh, the staging
No, not the staging
OMG I just realised it's the Miracle of Sound in the speakers:D
00,02i'm not sure, it probably works the same
alexxm: For fear of being called a dick, I tell you that apparently, it's to die for.
00,02not sure what you meen then
Or rather, at risk of*
When you put like 10 fuels in 1 stage, it groups and makes a fuel icon with a 10 next to it
Kammerjunk: lol
Well, that went better than expected.
SirGanjalf: And now i can reserve a ticket to hell
SirGanjalf: Travel agent?
Test
Oh, chat is just ded
Is it just me, or is Phase headed towards the ground at hundreds of times faster than evolution could possibly have prepared him for?
Yep
I'm surprised one of the kerbals aren't smiling, really.
Oh wait. Never mind.
Yeah, Jeb (the middle one) is almost always smiling

CCCP: You win this round -_-

Seriously? Dr. Horrible?

MadSurge: Just some fallout crashing and a really cute derpy trotting for about 5 minutes
CCCP, wub pays no bills

Sheep are funny

MadSurge: You missed me being disappoint at nopony knowing about Dr. Horrible.

Oh, good.
Kammerjunk: I barely know what that is, sorry
Jesus.
they they scream when you slowy put a sword through their neck
d3rb :P
05im suprised
oh hello Wrek
No you're not
At what?
/me hugs Wrek
Guess what time it is?
ohai Wrek
Hey Wrek!
05my WLF shirt arrived before my tf2 portrait :P
I hate it when media brings negativity to technology.
Wrek: what shirt? :)
/me starts singing the "Sphess Mehreens" song
It usually brings my parents' attention.
Spell-of-Gaming: Technology is the best thing ever.
ooh Phase got NV as well?
hope nv at least works lol
My parents don't realize I HAVE NO FRIENDS.
00,02AdamTheDuck, yup
I have friends
00,02not downloaded yet though
But they all do the same thing as me
ah ok
go home and play games
00,02ntfs compression sucks
05MadSurge: the one i ordered 2½ months ago
Except they aren't suicidal
Kammerjunk: Technology is BAD
Hai MadSurge!!!
CCCP: lolno
00,02but it has free'd enough space for fo:nv
wow your almost full
Wrek: I mean, what's on it? :D
I don't get this
00,02fluffle_puff, it was full
Hey CCCP!
If you have 1 eye, you have no depth perception
00,02infact theres ~190GB on there
Kammerjunk: its kind of worthless and unnessacary
70gb of porn
00,02HAVE to compress it
Ohai Wrek
But if you cover your eye or close it, you can see depth perfectly
What is this sorcery?
How much porn do I have?
Songs from the internet made me better than the songs you damn hear on real life. :I
I love playing NV between sudden crashes from trying to open random doors
Very_Silly_Filly: the greatest drawback of being a pirate :D
CCCP: I didn't say electricity, I said technology. That includes improvements in medicine.
00,02Very_Silly_Filly, you can aproximate depth without two eyes
no one asked Pwnies but i fear your going to tell us anyway
I still have 459 GB of free space :D
00,02same way you can kinda guess depth on a game
Kammerjunk: alright :|
00,02fluffle_puff, i have a 1TB drive
00,02its mostly full
/me realises he never saves his porn
/me only has 7mb
Media has a lot of hypocricity. A LOT.
05MadSurge: http://www.welovefine.com/1401-too-shy.html
00,02might end up with 40GB free space if that compress goes well
CCCP: No really, why don't you like technology? You're literally surrounded by it.
http://goo.gl/VPjky
Kammerjunk: Well its actually on because i barley understand it
00,02D'awwww
Wrek: HHHNNNNNNNGGGHHHHHH
STOP CRYING FLUTTERRAPE
00,02CCCP, thats not hard to fix
It is
Pwnies: Funny, BronyState backlogs are usually bigger than that. :D
I dont even know what Google Crome is!
Wrek: I am jelly of your shirt.
^
"SHIT"
Some of the shirts are weird
CCCP: You're talking over technology now, too.
Kammerjunk: this is hurting my brain
YAY, BIT TRIP!

Kammerjunk: I would pay a lot to hear that.

My mom kind of likes ponies.
She likes Rarity, at least.
Memme: I would pay a lot to keep my voice.
Kammerjunk: I would pay more to hear you without it.
My mum will never know I like poni
05MadSurge: nope
Pwnies: You will never be able to hide it.
Memme: she likes fabulousness then :D
She has no clue it exists
Pwnies: There's no stopping, first stage is denial xD
Memme: ...You say even though every time I come to my computer, you've called me at least thrice.
I never deny
MadSurge: Yeah. She likes everything I've told her about Rarity.
05the day will come when she reads a newspaper or sees on TV "grown men that like MLP" and goes "what a strange bunch dont you think boy?"
Pwnies: My whole family knows.
My parents are kinda meh about it, I suppose.
I'll say 'WELL FUCK ME WHERE MY DORITOS"
Wrek: Ultimate respon'm one of them."
Wrek: that will be a glorious day :D
"WHERE'S MY PRINGLES MUM"
Wrek: Damn, my message crashed.
Wrek: And then you answer by singing "Rainbow Dash always dresses in style".
And I killed the chat again. I still got it.
B+? B FUCKING +? GET OUT OF THE STREAM PHASE4. U HAVE FAILED FAMIRY
My mom and dad are kind of scared that I will meet "bad people".
Online?
Yea.
Memme: True.
Same
Memme: So were my parents when I went to a meetup. Then I told them my cousin was coming too, and then it's all cool.
you should have listened to them Memme, muhahahaha!
My cousin
05i was palnning on getting my mom (a huge trekkie) an item signed by john de lancie but since he had to cancel his visit at buck i guess that'll have to wait ^^
d3rb: SH**!
Is a...
Kammerjunk: Well played...
oh god he's a goddamn air head
Wrek: aww
he's pretty ripped
and knows it
Memme: The thing is, my cousin can't fight back for the life of him.
hey, I like this game :) but I will never be able to get though the Last level :(
So he shows off at any given time
So I don't know why it'd matter.
05whats this about fighting?
Kammerjunk: Who? Mads?
Yeah, him.
REALLY?
Wow.
I would never expect that.
I will be able to use this... > : )
is he playing that with the mouse or on the wii?
Actually my Mum would be meh about it but my dad...
oh god he'd think i was gay
wait... Desktop Pony... its the PC :/
My parents never really understood my feelings...
Pwnies: Tough love, sugarcube.

Pwnies: No homo.
Wrek: Basically, my parents were not all happy about me going to a meetup they don't know a lot about the fandom, but then I told them my cousin was going.

Is this bittrip or something?
Yeah, back btw

I told my Parents about MLP like 4 weeks ago... they were both like "Do whatever you want"
same
05ah
05i went to the meetup anyways
Not really sure how many 13 year olds there usually are at those...
My mum gives around 0 fucks about my bronydom
Memme: Are there even a lot of meetups in Sweden?
Kammerjunk: Don't think so.
But my dad is in a community that hates, and I mean HATES bronies
05there are quite a few
If he found out I was brony, god help me
05but the biggest one is in stockholm
YES!

You live in Umeå?

00,02GODDAMNITLAG
trying Lubuntu at the moment... Where do things get installed when I get them via the Terminal?
Did you HONESTLY fail on the first obsticle
actually, i might stay a but to see how this game is... :P
00,02Very_Silly_Filly, yes
Memme: i don't need to cause im 20% cooler than you :D
00,02the streaming is dropping it to 25fps
spartan133t: Prove it...
00,02plus audio lag
Ahh, okay
00,02:(
Yeah, I noticed the audiolag
seatsea1 is me i was just testing if evrytihng was alright on my other computer because i just reset
Phase4: really? I thought less fraps = less lag :P
I don't think Phase4 will make it through level 11
Phase4: Your computer must only be like 5 times better than mine then if it's that problematic
/me 00,02hugs Very_Silly_Filly
do you have a game system that was never made again in the last 10 years?
spartan133t: Vectrex
fps = frames per second. How the heck will less fraps improve it?
I don't even have a console.
00,02game boy colour?
hell yeah vectrex
00,02i think i crashed fmle
Very_Silly_Filly !?
Google it
bye bye everyponi
buffering?
it looks like a very old tv with two controllers hooked up to it O.o
Cya, CCCP
take it easy CCCP
Vectrex is funny, it doesn't even have a Resolution...
Yeah, it's like a miniture arcade machine
00,02i think fmle has died
bye CCCP :)
Lil_B: WHAT!?
Vectrex is good, the vectors look amazing
Phase4: You accidentally the fmle
Espeically Geomatry wars on Vectrex
Very_Silly_Filly: NO NOT MATH D: IM ON SUMMER VACATION D:!!
00,02Very_Silly_Filly, it was vector graphics iirc
spartan133t the Vectrex is like a Lazershow, its doesn't operate with pixels, even today the Vectrax ould make clearer streight lines than any other console... but thats the only positive thing XD
00,02that was its whole thing, drew vectors instead of bitmaps
00,02would have made for an interesting system to program
Lil_B, dont forget the awesome overlays
00,02yeah
00,02i accidentaly the whole fmle
what happened to the stream
And one of the best games for it was Geomatry wars
Phase4 people still make games for it :/
why are ads like Like Asain Women? these women despretly want a boyfriend! showing up!?
spartan133t: Your google history.
d3rb well, creativity :P
WT?F
WTF?!*
spartan133t: Use Adblock. :P
spartan133t, adblock

Malmortius: a guy in a black suit? :D
Yep.
I am not surprised, I'm on a modem.
On a laptop.
Away from home... : ' (
Phase4, the stream died again!
Laptops are usually better than PC;s fir ubterbets
Fuck my spelling
im on a laptop too a gamer laptop -.-
I'm on le shitbox
how much was your gamer laptop?
bob: how much did it cost?
Very_Silly_Filly: ubterbets?
Btw is Phase4 the owner of this site? Or what does the + sign stand for?
That's what I called my PC after it stopped pretty much running anything 07+
i assume you mean internets Very_Silly_Filly
Internet, yeah
whole body black but one single opening in the face to look through? must be a Ninja
pc>laptop
He's a carteridge
Lil_B: Or slenderman.
MaxTheSwedishBrony: he's almost a mod, the + makes him able to talk when only mods can
00,02interederp
im trying to remember
MaxTheSwedishBrony: He is a techie. He fixes the code of the website if something goes wrong. He also creates some things.
MadSurge: ah :)
bob: Still can't remember, what happened in September...
XAX: oh he does? :D
As far as I'm aware, Wrek's the owner, or is it still NewDCD?
wha?
bob: September by The Living Tombstone feat Mic the Mic.
Ghosties is the current Head Admin.
bob: It has so much win in it.
Well, admin lead.
wow
Ahh, okay.
I presume that means head admin.
bob: I can't remeber, what happened in September, back when everypony died, trails of blood during my stride.
On air for a moment :D
O.o
Memme: I could never make out that last line. Thank you.
XAX: Check the description?
XAX: x D
Memme: I always forget to do just that, most of the time.
XAX: Well, you learn something new every day, right? : )
Damn it, now I need to listen to the song.
I don't really listen to much of the fan music I like on YouTube anymore. I have most of the stuff listen to regularly downloaded.
It well be stuck in my head for the entire day... x.x
i think it was around 1,000 or somthing idk
but it was worth it ._.
Stream froze for me. 3:

Memme: I really love Beyond her Garden by WoodenToaster at the moment :D
It's back. :3
I can actually rap all of Beyond her Tomb :s
XAX: Yeah. I LOVE THEM ALL!
After that Audio Repeater disappeared, the stream froze for me. :3
XAX: I don't like raps that much. I like stories in the lyrics.
05hah
XAX: Preferably dark stories.
Memme: Agreed :D
05my dad even called my new shirt cute
O.o

We're on the brink of panic.
More Legend of Grimrock Wrek?
More drawing, Wrek?
:)

Its like an Oldschool rpg
I bought this game yesterday and started playing without automapping
Probably about Grim Reaper... and rocks
:p
this game sounds good
Oh no... Is this a horror game?
oh my god killer flubber
FIREBALLS!
Memme: Not exactly
when I tried drawing my own maps it would go out of bounds on my sheet of paper -.-

LOOOOOL POOTIS
Streamer is now Wrek i think?
DAMNIT......... refresh
MaxTheSwedishBrony: Yup.

I never paid much attention to this. One of your party members is POOTIS?
the buffer monster is gone
its a dungeon crawler game in oldschool style so ye
Who's POOTIS?
Seems like a nice game. :3
I am not disappoint.
So many different monster...

WREKS?
Wrek.
YEah

All i can remember from yesterdays stream of this is "AARRRGGGGHHH!"
POOTIS!
O.o i missed something yesterday D;?
MaxTheSwedishBrony: I'm with you.
: (
I missed Wall-E yestersday :(
Jesus, my class is having a big fight because of... something.
WALL-E?
It was really good :)
Spell-of-Gaming: :O
Spell-of-Gaming: Your class?
Spell-of-Gaming: Are you in CLASS?
nope.
there is something about Amiga music that makes it so smooth and relaxing and so much more appealing to me than normal VGM
your in school atm Spell-of-Gaming ?
Oh.
thats a lot of fish... I mean Slime
So, I heard you like Zelda and Ponies http://www.teefury.com/
There's a big fight between my classmates in FaceBook.
Spell-of-Gaming: Love and tolerate?
Facebook fights *facepalm*
xD
Jim: Agreed.
Our treasurer is being bullied by multiple people.
Yeaup
00,02though tbh facebook fight > real fight
00,02no one gets punched online
Cyber slapped
Not for the spectators!
Phase4: I love internet fights more than real fights.
facebook fights are way more lol too
Jim: xD
They're hilarious as hell.
00,02Memme, for what?
The chat?
Or am I completely wrong?
I wish Facebook has a feed link for comments, haha.
00,02Memme, nope
00,02i help code the website
Phase4: Oh.
I see.
00,02this chat is provided by ponychat
Aaaalright.
00,02link is somewhere over here ^
00,02derp
00,02i ment v, not ^
Winning an arguement on the internet is like running in the special Olympics. Even if you win, you're still retarded.
We need to message ponychat and tell them we need more emotions smileys like Aj and Celestia and others
:P
Phase4 I have a question about linux :/
whats this then???
Jim: Agreed.
00,02Lil_B, :)
just need an aj one
and who's streaminjg?
Wrek check the options, there should be an autosave key to save you going into the menu
Link for Ponychat is doooooown there. Above the refresh and popout button.
Flyboy: Wrek.
kk
pootis?
really?
Who's Pootis?
00,02Lil_B, whats your question?
Phase4 I have typed "sudo apt-get XChat" like in the instructions (I'm using Lubuntu atm) but I don't know if it did anything or where it is now
apparently one of the characters he has
Painis Cupcake was pootis all along
00,02ah
Hey everypony!
Heya Pinkie_Kittie !
hi Pinkie_Kittie
Pinkie_Kittie: Hola!
hello Pinkie_Kittie
00,02Lil_B, lubuntu == lxde right?
hello Pinkie_Kittie
Phase4 yes
00,02has a start menu like thing, should be under network
:)
H.E.A.V.Y. Pootis was Painis Cupcake?
00,02or you can press alt+f2 and run xchat
Did he just pick up a chest?
Buffer monster.
Nevermind. Just my crappy internet.
00,02Lil_B, you might need to run 'sudo apt-get install xchat'
00,02the install bit is important
Phase4 hanks, I'll try that
Phase4, favourite pont?
pony*
00,02Malmortius, Twilight
:(
No one likes rarity it seems
Moo
why no love for twilight Malmortius ?
I love twilight, but i love rarity more =D
I love all ze ponies.
Malmortius: Twilight is best pony.
^ thats the best way to go about it i think, all pony is best pony
Malmortius: But that's just me.
Inb4 ded
ITS A TRAP
Wrek you're dead :(
Malmortius: Watcha ya'll talking about?We gots Rarity fans here :3
Heh
woo!
I mean, you can't argue why somepony is best pony.
Getting killed by slimes? Worst. Possible. Thing. EVER.
"well... we're f*cked..."
holy shit they murdered him
zzzz
Going to sleep? REALLY?
I think each pony has a reason to be a persons favourite, there is no wrong answer.
00,02all ponies are best, some are more best than others
Phase4: Because of personal opinions.
>more best
I smiled.
^^
"sudo apt-get install Xchat" and "run Xchat" didn't do anything maybe I should stick with Mint where its preinstalled XD
This game has so far been a bit repedetive dont you think? its a good game dont get me wrong .
00,02Lil_B, there should have been messages from when you ran apt-get
Phase4 that reminds me a line from animal farm
00,02Texasboykc09, that was the idea ^_^
Phase4 nothing happened
WHAT
man
00,02Lil_B, define nothing
We're reading animal farm in Engrish at the moment.
MaxTheSwedishBrony: It's got fireballs. It can't be THAT repetitive.
Phase4 the command line closed, the end :/
^^
Fireballs always make a game better.
00,02Lil_B, it doesnt say anything
00,02?
00,02it should ask for a password or run apt
Stop taking my monies Steam :<
00,02and if it runs apt it WILL output something
Jim: Steam: NO. > : (
Jim: Exactly what im thinking D: i bought 9 games already
bad steam, leave jims money alone!
I bought 0.
I haven't bought a single game, simply because I already own all the ones I want
Phase4 well, when I type "run Xchat" it says "failed to execute child process "run" (No such file in directory)"
Plus we have 190+ games, I think that'senough
?
O.o
00,02Lil_B, just xchat, no run, and no caps
i keep seing good games and thinking i'll play that....eventually....buy
this one is pretty cheap on steam right now
Phase4 "failed to execute child process "xchat" (No such file in directory)"
00,02ok, so xchat isnt installed
00,02Lil_B, lets move this to a pm
ok
I have problems with my oc.
: (
I like my OC :)
Just found a random firewire port on the desk
/me has no oc
I like mine too, but I have trouble with the eyes.
i feel like im a lost lil colt in a cave , protect meh
http://i.imgur.com/BQI2v.jpg
zanon: /me grants you the power to wield fire magic.
My eyes in my OC are Dark red. They look nice with the Dark Bluw :)
*Blue
jim :D
Wait, the command isn't /me?
Ponies47: I'm trying to get my real eyecolor into my OC's eyes. It's hard as nails.
you must say /me in the begining of a sentance
/me like this
Ah.
dat game does look quite fun
Memme: Good luck with that
/me grants zanon the ability to wield fire magic.
Wrek: There was a chain
There we go!
O.o
Ponies47: It's hard, since I can only have 1 color, not 2.
:<
Not like outer part brown, inner part green, kind of.
bla
what just happened here
bla
I mean, how do you make a color out of mixing brown and green.
test*
pony_552: Test accomplished.
yep, thanks
somepony was telling me it was not working the chat that is
Or maybe I can just have one eye brown, one green.
Hmmm...
Memme: You should keep me the same. I did with my OC
*Them
But I want the correct color D:
Then choose silly :P
Memme: Too overrated.
what game is this?
Spell-of-Gaming: I have nothing better to do ; )
Ponies47: I can't chose! D:
Memme: Can't you make a trollfic?
Memme, flip a coin
Look me in real life my eyes are brown. My OC's eyes. There dark red
yum jello
I'm not saying they HAVE to be your real life color.
Memme: Hush. Your time will come when you know it's the right color
SOON
Very very soon
Also, I don't even know what color my real life eyes are.
I can't describe them, that is.
mirror?
ah ok lol
They're kind of green-brown, but more brown, and then they're more like yellow than green...
Kind of.
...
Well, that worked.
Kind of.
hazel?
sounds like hazel kinda
Hmm...
well this doesn't look like it'll go well
Yea!
They're hazel.
POOTIS!
d3rb: Thanks.
omg a troll
no problem dude
KILL THE HATER TROLL!
troll in the dungeon
diht, dont fed it!
Wrek is a mod, he can handle a troll....
shit**
that is a really slow troll
kill howard stern
Noob troll.
Moo ^^
Also, what did Howard Stern do?
RUN WREK RUN
Link, please?
wat he always does
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: Breathe?
Or something more?
shock humor
howard stern does whatever he wants, i dont see the fuss
^
But didn't he do something to bronies, or something?
oh he did
what did he do
If someone could summarize, I would be very happy.
sorta, he just took all the bad elements the comunity has and said this is what all bronies are like
compared to his usual stuff, it really wasn't all that bad
Clopping?
yep
he looked for the worst you can find about bronies and used that as if all of bronies were like that
Wow.
wow
Well, ofcourse we all clop.
.....nope
WHAT ELSE WOULD WE DO?
Right?
*sarcasm*
Memme: read notice
my sarcasm detector is broken
/me Eye twitchs "8:00 AM my little ponies and Ponies47 still hasen't slept yet" :)
basically he said that all of us are cloppers, and he talked about how we should be ashamed
spiiiiiderrrrs
ehm: ?
he didnt say it directly but he kept laughing and saying that we're all creeps
I see.
but then he does that to everything
also he only played the clopper nterviews
ergo it was howardbstern being howard stern
he's just howard thats why
and depressed people
zanon: maybe, doesnt mean he isnt a prick
So is this game any good ;p
on his show which is all about shock humor amd who gives a flippin' damn
oh im aware he does it for shock value
i'm back

*blinks*
sdaj jaknc
Don't we have that, though?
doesnt ponychat have one
No

d3rb: PonyChat has several.
Kammerjunk: Bronystate, itself, is becoming a RP channel. :3
:D
i have a rpg group on skype but its non r34 due to my daughter reading it.
Spell-of-Gaming: Unfortunately.
Kammerjunk: It already is.
What's up with the awesome music?
Memme: 'Slong as it's not excessive RP.
Kammerjunk: Yea.
How awkward mustn't having your daughter read your RP?
I'm bored, I might as well make a RP channel for Bronystate. :D
Jim: That depends on what kind of RP.
How awesome mustn't it be?
What do when bored?
the rp the group i do is not so dark and does not have any adult content thus my daughter is invested into the characters and storylines
Stuff.
not sure if im really tired or just bored
d3rb: Bored, and tired.
d3rb: Might be bored.
both*
bored of being tired maybe
Kammerjunk: I was first! : D
tired of being bored :D
Excactly.
I just am.
I don't even know what anymore.
I want to hear Kammerjunks voice! D:
Well, boo hoo hoo.

Am I allowed to link stuff in here?

I even Preordered it, got the Potato Sack and got the Golden Potatos
Not videos?
i think as long as its not video and its sfw its ok..i think
not during a strea
Ok.
Memme pictures are nomarly ok, but different mods=diffetrent opinions
Then I won't link.
what is it Memme ?
A song.
Youtube.
Portal 2 remix.
ah...yeah probably best not too
Completely unnecessary.
But it's cool.
at least not while stream is on
Ok.
I have never seen any mod say that pictures during a stream is uncool. However, linking video during stream is totally uncool.
Oh hi, SB.
dat sb64
some people were working on a Crhistmas Portal 2 remix album, but they kinda aborted ti :(
oah SuperBrony64
Kammerjunk: Then I shall become a mod and ban ALL the pictures >=D
Very_Silly_Filly: D:
You ponies are cool
Even the cute ones?
Yeees.
Kammerjunk I heard some saying they want to know when you post something no matter what kinds of Links
Very_Silly_Filly, you monster!
Why?
:3
http://derpy.me/Wm6Zw
Lil_B: People post pictures all the time, though.
There's CCCP right now, for example.
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!
?
http://derpy.me/51fCg
/me bans CCCP even though he can't ban yet

i dont love them
Yeah, but half the bloody world haven't heard of the Beatles
I love to watch 2nd graders try to spell bad words xD
i respect them, i dont mind them, but i dont love them
Beatles are a fundamental band for modern music
Stupid is a bad word!

Hi everypony!
hi Calcos323 :)

CCCP: people are stupid. lets kill em
What are we watching?
insane: your sister should learn to shut up. she's gonna sound stupid in public
twily_sprinkle_GS17: O_O
but music was better back in my day ya whippersnappers
Calcos323 do u believe in santa ?
If I heard that kind of language around from her, she'd have a million bullets through her head
insane: What kind of question is that?
Justin Bieber is soooo much better than Beatles
lol
Do you?
Eh, I prefer Nicki Minaj over Justin Beiber.
Maybe...
http://derpy.me/NZQIw
WELL HE ISN'T REAL
"I know back than when the Great Debatte started... was Beethovens Symphony Nr.9 Music or a unharmoniced misshmash of Notes?! The music industry was on fire back then!"
Nicki Minaj has amazing music. so artistic, so deep
id rather listen to stat^
staic*
All of the hate for Justin Beiber is so unnessicary
insane: NOOOOOOOOOO
Oh em gee I know!
as much as I hate modern music, I have a soft spot for Call Me Maybe and a few One Direction songs
i actually hate bieber
CCCP: lies
hes a arrogant prick
HA HA HA HA HA!
Hi everypony.

Seriously, though, what game is this?
I hate modern music althoegther

what genres do youl like?
99 Luftbalons by Nena.
alexxm: but yeah i was talking about bieber
Very_Silly_Filly Literally like just about everyone hates him, why? For the soul purpose that they dont like his music. They base his entire personality off his music or stupid things that he gets paid to do.
alexxm: I couldnt sleep at all.
I'm back.
*nobody cares*
CCCP: false. i hate him because hes arrogant
CCCP: and hes a plague of music
/me hugs Memme
I don't hate him for the music
CCCP: also hating bieber is the cool thing to do, so...
hate is so mainstream
CCCP: all he does is PR for money
Love and tolerate?
Who's playing Grimrock?
every kid in the class hates justin
I hate him because he makes more money than me.
Lol Dashite
I don't hate him.
derpy_pony: I just dislike, and go on my way
bieber puts so much effort into looking cool
Dashite, Wrek is. He got it as a Birthday present.
Why would I?
Jb is fat
Anyway good folks, what be streamin'?
Just because I dislike his music doesn't mean I want him to die or something.

alexxm: And who be streamiun'?

BlazeAngel: Wrek
Wrek.
CCCP: no, Lauren actrually cared for making a family-friendly show. but otherwise everything in our world is done for money
CCCP: thats just the egoistic system weve built
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY!

Hey Meanwhile!
I just woke up early to watch FIM on the hub. It's friday and all. And winter wrap up comes on so..
Allo MadSurge. :3

Liokin: You don't do any assasination, you're a monster hunter in the game.
Firelight the song will be stuck in your head aaaallll day now
I want The Hub in Sweden... :'(
Liokin: The assasination of the king is just the main plot line
care bears in on the hub right now for me -.-
XD
RobertRevenge: with occasional bandits and the like?
RobertRevenge: So that king guy he just be-headed was some kinda monster?
Thats funny Firelight... its Saturday here. Its 12:00 AM.
screw care bears!!!!!
Not sure if that's a very sensitive mouse or Wrek just likes swinging the camera.
bob how bad is ti
ewwwwwwwww Care Bears
never really a fan of witcher
BlazeAngel: Tiem Zones....
Liokin: That was a rogue witcher, and if I remember correctly, your main antagonist in the game
they are talking about friendship NOOOO
Meanwhile: I do love to swing cameras around :D
I used to love care bears
Firelight: I know right?
Eww care bears is on for me too

bob: THAT;S MY LITTLE PONIES JOB! :[
MadSurge: Yeah, I think so. I haven't played this one much, but I played the hell out of the first Witcher
RobertRevenge: Ok so you dont kill kings then?
the witcher has two swords. 1 for fighting humans and 1 for fighting everything else...
RobertRevenge: But the other guy does?
Something sounds like bugbears.

bob: Care Bears are weird all they do is care about stuff.
I would go gay for Geralt. Just saying.
Very_Silly_Filly: I want to play a game, what should I play?
ponies47: Lul rly?
Tetris
Memme: fallout new vegas
i remember stewie had a care bear
Why does the protag
Super Meat Boy
he said its just a care bear
Why does the protaganist always have a deep voice.
Bronysith: I can't! I'm on a laptop!
Oh no! The fat kid ran out of food! We care Bout him! SO WE KILL THE CHILDREN FOR HIS FOOD
insane: Yeah, Exactly.
BlazeAngel: Because for some reason sounding like a dishwasher full of sand is cool nowadays.

Firelight: Guess so :/

And I don't like Fallout NV that much, either...
Meanwhile: XD

WHY YOU NO END CARE BEARS >:O
00,03Don't wake me I plan on sleeping in~
Scoot-Scootaloo.
Scoot-Scootaloo: Gotcha.
Scoot-Scootaloo
Scoot-Scootaloo.

I was about to say that not all cats are ninjas... then I thought about and realized that that most cats ARE ninjas.
Hmm.. 2 brother Sleepin' at my place for the week... BLAST THE THEME AND WAKE THEM UP.
/me glomps Scoot-Scootaloo and injects him full of adrenaline
Aaaah, it's the Ticket Master episode
That's horrible
Using a controller?

00,03Wrek is right here!

Scoot-Scootaloo: Other ones.

I have two mice
Then again, my youngest cat is probably more ninja-like than most cats. When there's a scary noise such as (until recently) company, she will do a ninja vanish.
Put all your points in charisma and sleep with EVERYTHING
Meanwhile: Aaah. How many pets do you have?

Surprised it wasn't a shooting suicide honestly.
NO more its torture lol :'(
im not really motion sickness from games ._.
Out of all the things that could happen this is, THE. WORST. POSSIBLE, THING!
._.
i think its just the camra when ever he gets hit or rolls
What, I mean it this time.
I don't recall the camera being so shaky when I played Witcher 2 Oo
hurts my EYES @_@
bob: im not prone to it either but even I notice how shaky the cam is in this game.
now theres probably going to be safety speeches before a movie starts
yeah not sure why he didnt kill himself but he did want to tell the police to try getting in his aprtment
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: OR TSA theatre version :D

YourLittleDashie: YAY
I bet they NEVER get their cutie marks
Barbetos|Atwork: Blank flanks forever
Thats the talent they all have.
BlazeAngel: The CMC will probably the mane characters in Gen5
That or they are mutant ponies
Barbetos|Atwork: Unless their cutie mark is a flank with no cutie marks.
08,01Calcos323: ...
My cutie mark is cake
Tbh the whole "CMC get their cutie marks" probably isn't something that'll happen on screen.
08,01Calcos323: i don't fuck everyone i meet
08,01just your dad
08,01he was special.
Pffft.
Meanwhile: That is also a posiblity
For the oblivious reason of: I like cake
I'm in a good mood today. Hooray for Friday!
It's just not the type of occurence that's likely for the show YourLittleDashie.
Mine is a burning Cookie.
GilDash: :)
hi people :3
Meanwhile: Yeah they'll have them for G5
Maybe
I mean, it's fantastic that the folks working on it acknowledge the fandom as much as they do but at the end of the day it's a cartoon working on the standard cartoon formula.
Meanwhile: Yeah... :)
I think I'll find some D'aww for the stream... BRB
OW. I smashed myself in the scoogilies with a remote...
I'd be surprised if we even got an 'ending' episode when the show finally stops.

Kandarihu: I didn't like them beforehand either, though.
WOOH
"More teens ARE having fuck"
Jigsaw wants to play a game
XD
:O
YES SLENDER

Slender!
Yes roosterteeth!
SLENDER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ha
SLENDER
slender
Slender ftw
SLENDER :D
that way
XD slender
This game was kinda boring.
Is this... A Slenderman game?
Pale_Horse: yes
Awesome! :D
Kammerjunk, and why is that? Because you were told by all the other media outlets and the left-wing blogs to hate them?
How to win: Don't look behind you.
Kandarihu: 1 comedian, a partner, a camera crew and a sound crew, to the entire damn nation!
dang
Gavin is an idiot.
The cricket was murdered
lol
Gavin is the best Employee i've ever seen
Slenderman isn't in Skyrim?
i already saw slenderman here
LOL
BronyInstrumental, this was at 3 in the morning? Are we going to hold Cartoon Network responsible for what happens on Adult Swim?
ikr Darkts3|Drawing|MLG
god i hate you
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: one of the most entertaining ones thats for sure.
Of course, you really don't need to be in the woods for the Slenderman to get you... He can pop in anywhere he likes... :(
I am sure Slenderman could be put in Skyrim with the workshop
xD
Weeping Angel!
Slenderman!
Kandarihu: when i saw it on live TV it was at 8:AM
Kammerjunk, you think everyone else is neutral?
Remember the game!
How to win at Slender: Don't look back.
Everlasting_Joy: thats a reverse Weeping Angel
And now Slender
I'm back
11,01I have no clue how to download things from The Steam Workshop.
Nittany_Discord: ikr
XD
AAAAAAAAAAAH
xD
11,01Also, I wish SPAZ has went on sale.
XD
I love this.
DUDE RUN AWAY!!!
GJ Gavin >.>
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: err yeah, yeah you're right.
YES I SAW IT!
Wood Strobelight!
XD
Kandarihu: Their bias just turns downright insulting after a while. They seem very prejudice to me.
What game is this?
God dammit gavin
AttacktheAndalite: ITS SLENDER!!
05Nittany_Discord: spaz is fun, but the end game is a bit repetitive
LOL
cant run away when staring at it....
As a Tea Party supporter, that's how I feel about CNN and MSNBC.
lol
Wrek: get paper, run away?
But he has no eyes.
Kandarihu: I'm not saying everyone but the Fox Network is neutral, I'm saying Fox comes across very strongly to me.
Why does everone who is investigating slenderman do it in the middle of the night and alone? Why not in the middle of the day with like 12 friends?
11,01I watched a WTF on Spec Ops: The Line. The SP looked great story-wise, but the MP had a terribly set-up unlock system.
Sorry, what am I even saying? I mean on the Internet.
XD
xD
Pale_Horse, some have tried during the day... it turns to night quickly
:D
XXXXXXXDDDDDDDDDD
XD
Anyone else getting Blair Witch Project vibs?
Pale_Horse it wouldn't be entertaining that way
*Vibes.
xD
STOP YELLING
Everyone whines about FOX News channel having a right-wing bias and claims that it's not even news because apparently the views that FOX states are invalid or some junk.
Xd
Both good answers. :P
RUN
xD
Kandarihu: more that news, by its nature, is meant to as objective as possible.
Everlasting_Joy: That's Marble Hornets for you.
11,01I don't watch the news enough to form opinion.
RAWRity: But biased news sells more.
what are they doing there?
xD
so any kind of Bias is a valid criticism of a news station.
Lol
11,01I decided years ago that the news is the same shit; different day.
FAWK! :D
I don't watch the news because I don't need anymore reason to be depressed.
Whoevers runing the stream should paly slender!!!!!!!!!!
Kammerjunk, and yet you've reached the same conclusion about them that the internet has reached.
Is this some Slenderman game?
And so has Wrek
11,01Murder. Politics. Women's health.
Kandarihu: Well yes, Fox News is what I can find on YouTube.
11,01SS;DD
AttacktheAndalite: yes
Oh thats...bad
Two Vitriolic Best Buds Play
11,01Also celebrities.
XD
I've heard a theory that Slenderman is actually a servant of Zalgo.
xD
lol

streamer: look up Team FOur Star 50 Shades of Grey
Kandarihu: me too .__.
Well, I can't swallow anything without feeling like I've swallowed a bunch of tiny sharp blades again, so I'm going to go make some tea.
RAWRity: "streamer"? You don't know who's on?
